TODOs
==============================================================================

* Add [bats-core](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and unit tests.
* Add test data that can legally be distributed. These can be used in the tests and in examples.
* Move the scripts in `bin` into a separate project so they can easier be installed.
