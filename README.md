Towards a poster/article

TODO: Find definitive scope and title. Should we cover editors such as vim?

# Introduction

work of the expert searcher/information specialist is often tied closely to a limited range of (GUI based) software products that shape the way one works and thinks

# Use cases

## Checking search results

## Comparing search results

See 

* https://catonmat.net/set-operations-in-unix-shell-simplified
* https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/Set-operations.html

## Postprocessing search result for easier import

Unite search results that ha to be exported in chunks.

See D:\dimdi\_templates\unite_wos_files.bash

## Building query strings

## Updating searches

## Documenting searches

## Conclusions

avoid errors
save time

But also a matter of philosophy:
save you from the repetitive tasks that computers were built for and concentrate on the things that (currently) only people can do
enhance your skill set
make you happier and more confident
set you on a path that will lead to new ideas (more automation, new analyses)
