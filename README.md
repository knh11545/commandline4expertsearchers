## General

TODO: Should we cover editors such as vim?

https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/coreutils.html#Opening-the-software-toolbox

## Use cases

### Checking search results

### Comparing search results

See 

* https://catonmat.net/set-operations-in-unix-shell-simplified
* https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/Set-operations.html

### Postprocessing search result for easier import

Unite search results that had to be exported in chunks.

See D:\dimdi\_templates\unite_wos_files.bash

### Building query strings

### Updating searches

### Documenting searches

### Searching for patterns that are not supported by search interfaces

* Use command line tools like grep to post-process a selected number of records (from a more general search) that was downloaded
* Use local phrase searching using eDirect and a local copy of PubMed

### Build custom export formats

The new PubMed interface does not support the rich MEDLINE export format. Convert XML records to MEDLINE format?
