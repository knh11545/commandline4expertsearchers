ID WOMEN; GUIDELINES
AB Background: Urinary tract infections (UTI) are one of the most common infections treated in primary care and the emergency department. The R(x)OUTMAP study demonstrated that management of uncomplicated UTI by community pharmacists resulted in high clinical cure rates similar to those reported in the literature and a high degree of patient satisfaction. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of community pharmacist-initiated compared to family or emergency physician-initiated management of uncomplicated UTI.
   Methods: A decision analytic model was used to compare costs and outcomes of community pharmacist-initiated management of uncomplicated UTI to family or emergency physician-initiated management. Cure rates and utilities were derived from published studies. Costs of antibiotic treatment and health services use were calculated based on cost data from Canada. We used a probabilistic analysis to evaluate the impact of treatment strategies on costs and quality-adjusted-life-months (QALMs). In addition, a budget impact analysis was conducted to evaluate the financial impact of community pharmacist-initiated uncomplicated UTI management in this target population. This study was conducted from the perspective of the public health care system of Canada.
   Results: Pharmacist-initiated management was lower cost ($72.47) when compared to family and emergency physician-initiated management, $141.53 and $368.16, respectively. The QALMs gained were comparable across the management strategies. If even only 25% of Canadians with uncomplicated UTI were managed by community pharmacists over the next 5 years, the resulting net total savings was estimated at $51 million.
   Conclusion: From a Canadian public health care system perspective, community pharmacist-initiated management would likely be a cost-effective strategy for uncomplicated UTI. In an era of limited health care resources, expanded roles of community pharmacists or other non-physician community based prescribers are important mechanisms through which accessible, high-quality and cost-effective care may be achieved. Further studies to evaluate other conditions which can be managed in the community and their cost effectiveness are essential.

AB Background: Refugees have significant unmet health needs. Delivering services to refugees continues to be problematic in the Australian healthcare system. A systematic review and thematic synthesis of the literature exploring refugee perceptions of the Australian healthcare system was performed.
   Methods: Titles and abstracts of 1610 articles published between 2006 and 2019 were screened, and 147 articles were read in full text. Depending on the type of study, articles were appraised using the Modified Critical Appraisal Tool (developed by authors), the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool, or the JBI Appraisal Checklist for Systematic Reviews. Using QSR NVivo 11, articles were coded into descriptive themes and synthesised into analytical themes. An explanatory model was used to synthesise these findings. Confidence in the review findings were assessed with GRADE-CERQual approach.
   Results: The final synthesis included 35 articles consisting of one systematic review, 7 mixed methods studies, and 27 qualitative studies. Only one study was from a regional or rural area. A model incorporating aspects of engagement, access, trust, and privacy can be used to explain the experiences of refugees in using the Australian healthcare system. Refugees struggled to engage with health services due to their unfamiliarity with the health system. Information sharing is needed but this is not always delivered effectively, resulting in disempowerment and loss of autonomy. In response, refugees resorted to familiar means, such as family members and their pre-existing cultural knowledge. At times, this perpetuated their unfamiliarity with the broader health system. Access barriers were also encountered. Trust and privacy are pervasive issues that influenced access and engagement.
   Conclusions: Refugees face significant barriers in accessing and engaging with healthcare services and often resorted to familiar means to overcome what is unfamiliar. This has implications across all areas of service provision. Health administrators and educators need to consider improving the cultural competency of staff and students. Policymakers need to consider engaging communities and upscale the availability and accessibility of professional language and cultural supports. Research is needed on how these measures can be effectively delivered. There is limited research in remote areas and further evidence is needed in these settings.

TI Bridging barriers to advance multisector approaches to improve food
   security, nutrition and population health in Nepal: transdisciplinary
   perspectives
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH

AB Background: Understanding stakeholders' perceptions is crucial to the development and implementation of any intervention. However, a structured approach to eliciting stakeholder insights into complex, multisector issues of food security, household environment and health is lacking in many low and middle-income countries. This qualitative, workshop-based participatory study explores stakeholders' experiences of developing and implementing multisector interventions to provide transdisciplinary lessons for future developments in low and middle-income countries.
   Methods: Participants were purposely selected based on their involvement in, or exposure to, the multisector intervention. Participants with interests in agriculture, nutrition, household air-quality, drinking water-quality and health from academic institutes, government and developmental organisations were brought together at a one-day workshop to participate in a series of discussions on issues relating to food security, nutrition, household environment and health in Nepal. All group discussions were audio-recorded and transcribed, and a thematic qualitative analysis performed to identify relevant themes.
   Results: The government's ongoing Multisector Nutrition Plan, stakeholders' willingness to work together, availability of local infrastructure for cross-institutional inputs and increasing global movement towards transdisciplinary approaches were identified by the 33 workshop participants, representing 23 organisations as key factors determining success of transdisciplinary work. Fragmentation, lack of research-based and practice-based evidence, limited transdisciplinary knowledge amongst sectoral stakeholders, short-term funding and lack of knowledge-sharing mechanisms were identified as barriers, often creating systematic problems for successful implementation. Stakeholders suggested methods to bring about success included: improved knowledge, both amongst policy-makers and implementers, of food security and its linkage with nutrition, household environments, health and hygiene; investment in collaborative practice-based research and evidence-based practice; and strengthened transdisciplinary collaboration between multi-stakeholders, such as researchers, implementers and beneficiaries, throughout the intervention development and implementation process.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that multisector approach needs to adapt to take into account the experiences and views of the stakeholders concerned. The paper offers recommendations for successful development and implementation of future multisector interventions in Nepal that can be extrapolated to other low and middle-income countries, and lays foundations for future transdisciplinary working to support realisation of the recommendations.

AB Background: Obesity ranks as a major public health problem in many countries in the world. The obesity-socioeconomic status relationship is not well established in middle-income countries.
   Methods: The aim of this study was to estimate the obesity and overweight trends from 2002 to 2013 by sex, age, and educational levels among Brazilian adults. The panel prevalence trend study was conducted, considering the sample weights and study design. Three nationwide surveys were analyzed: the Household Budget Survey 2002/2003 and 2008/2009, and the National Health Survey 2013. The total sample was 234,791 adults aged 20-59 years.
   Results: The prevalence of obesity increased from 7.5 to 17.0% from 2002 to 2013 among adults aged 20-39 years and from 14.7 to 25.7% among those aged 40-59 years, slightly higher among young women. In each survey, education was positively associated with the prevalence of obesity among men, whereas this association was negative among women. The greatest increase in the prevalence of obesity was 90% (11.9 to 22.5%) and occurred from 2008 to 2013 among women with secondary educational level, whereas at the pre-primary level there was a 42% (20.4 to 29.0%) increase.
   Conclusions: Obesity prevalence in Brazil continued to increase, mostly among women with secondary education. Policies aimed at reducing the prevalence of obesity should consider sociodemographic characteristics in the population.

ID PROGRAM; SYSTEM
AB Background: In Brazil, 70% of the population depends on the public healthcare system. Since early detection is considered crucial, this study aimed to evaluate temporal changes in breast cancer screening coverage provided under the Brazilian National Health Service (SUS) according to the different regions of the country between 2008 and 2017.
   Methods: This ecological study analyzed data on breast cancer screening within the SUS for women aged 50-69 years. Coverage was calculated from the ratio between the number of screening tests conducted and the expected number for the target population. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to calculate annual percent changes (APC) in coverage.
   Results: Around 19 million mammograms were performed in 50-69-year old women within the SUS between 2008 and 2016. The estimated APC indicates that breast cancer screening coverage increased by 14.5% annually in Brazil between 2008 and 2012 (p<0.01), with figures stabilizing between 2012 and 2017 as shown by an APC of -0.4% (p=0.3). In the five geographic regions of the country, the APC initially increased, then stabilized in the north, northeast and southeast and decreased in the south and Midwest. Of the 26 states, coverage increased in seven and remained stable in six. In the other 13, there was an initial increase followed by stabilization in 11, and a reduction in coverage in two. In the Federal District, coverage remained stable throughout the study period.
   Conclusion: Evaluation of the temporal changes in breast cancer screening coverage provided under the Brazilian National Health Service revealed an initial increase, confirming that public policies were effective, although insufficient to ensure organized screening. There appears to be a lack of uniformity between the different regions and states and this situation is highlighted in the final 5-year period, with the APC reflecting stabilization of breast cancer screening coverage.

AB Background: Dengue fever is the world's fastest spreading mosquito borne viral infection. It is prevalent throughout both subtropical and tropical region, and affects over 128 countries. Dengue virus (DENV) infection poses a serious global public health challenge to three billion people, resulting in approximately 200 million cases of morbidity and 50,000 cases of mortality annually. In Cameroon like in most sub-Saharan African countries, DENV infection occur concurrently with other infectious diseases whose symptoms often overlap, rendering differential diagnosis challenging. This study aims at determining the frequency of acute dengue among febrile children under 15 years attending hospitals in some areas of Cameroon.
   Methods: A total of 961 children under the age of 15 were recruited in a cross-sectional study using systematic sampling technique and by selecting each subject out of the three. The study was conducted in 10 public health centers in Cameroon. Demographic data and risk factors of the subjects were obtained using well-structured questionnaires. Dengue virus NS1 antigen, IgM and IgG were analysed using a Tell me fast (R) Combo Dengue NS1-IgG/IgM Rapid Test. An in-house ELISA test for dengue specific IgM antibody was equally performed for confirmation. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed using Graph pad version 6.0.
   Results: A prevalence of 6.14% acute dengue virus infection was observed among children with febrile illness with a significant difference (p=0.0488) between males (4.7%) and females (7.7%). In addition, children who reportedly were unprotected from vectors, showed a comparatively higher prevalence of the disease seropositivity than those practicing protective measures.
   Conclusion: DENV infection therefore is an important cause of fever among children in Cameroon. Thus, there is a need to include differential screening for DENV infections as a tool in the management of fever in children in the country.

AB Purpose
   We described the medication use during pregnancy in the French population using the French Pregnancy Cohort (FPC).
   Methods
   The FPC was built with the sampling of all pregnant women included in the French Echantillon generaliste des beneficiaires (EGB), which is a 1/97th representative sample of the population covered by the French health insurance. The EGB includes anonymized information on the socio-demographic and medical characteristics of beneficiaries, and the health care services they have received such as diagnoses and procedure codes as well as data on filled reimbursed medication; EGB also includes data on hospital stays in all public and private French health facilities. Each filled prescription record contains information on drug brand and generic names, date of prescription and date of dispensing, quantity dispensed, mode of administration, duration of prescription, dosage, and prescribing physician specialty. FPC includes data on all pregnancies of women in the EGB (2010-2013). Date of entry in the FPC is the first day of pregnancy regardless of pregnancy outcome (spontaneous abortions or planned abortions (with or without medical reasons), deliveries), and data on women are collected retrospectively for a period of one year before pregnancy, and prospectively during pregnancy, and up to one year after delivery. The prevalence of prescribed medications before, during and after pregnancy was compared; comparison was also done between trimesters. Pregnancy outcomes are described and include spontaneous and planned abortions, livebirths, and stillbirths.
   Results
   FPC includes data on 36,065 pregnancies. Among them, 27,253 (75.6%) resulted in a delivery including 201 stillbirths (0.7%). The total number of spontaneous abortions was 6,718 (18.6%), and planned abortions 2,094 (5.8%). The prevalence of filled medication use was 91.1%, 89.9%, and 95.6% before, during and after pregnancy, respectively. Although there was a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of use once the pregnancy was diagnosed (first trimester exposure, 76.4% vs. exposure in the year prior to pregnancy, 91.1% (p<.01)), post-pregnancy medication use was above the pre-pregnancy level (95.6%). Maternal depression was the most prevalent comorbidity during pregnancy (20%), and post-partum depression was higher in those who delivered a stillborn infant (38.8%) as well as in those with a spontaneous (19.5%) or planned abortion (22.4%) compared to those with a liveborn (12.0%).
   Conclusion
   FPC is an excellent tool for the study of the risk and benefit of drug use during the perinatal period. FPC has the advantage of including a representative sample of French pregnant women, and study medications only available in France in addition to others available worldwide.

TI Using social network analysis to plan, promote and monitor intersectoral
   collaboration for health in rural India
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   As population health and well-being are influenced by multiple factors that cut across sectoral boundaries, an intersectoral approach that acknowledges and leverages the multiple determinants, actors and sectors at play is increasingly seen as critical for achieving meaningful and lasting improvements. In this study, we utilize social network analysis (SNA) to characterize the intersectoral collaboration between the organizations working on maternal & child health (MCH) and water & sanitation (WASH) before and immediately after the implementation of HCL Foundation (HCLF)-funded HCL Samuday Project (2015-2017) in a rural block of Uttar Pradesh state, India. While SNA has been used to examine public health issues, few have used it monitor stakeholder relationships, intervene, improve and facilitate project implementation involving intersectoral partnerships, particularly in the context of a low-and middle-income countries.
   Method
   An organization-level SNA was conducted with 31 key informants from 24 organizations working on MCH and/or WASH in Kachhauna, Uttar Pradesh, India. Data were collected using face-to-face, semi-structured interviews between June and September 2017. Density, centrality and homophily were calculated to describe the network and a qualitative analysis was also conducted to identify the strengths and weaknesses of collaboration between organizations working on MCH and WASH.
   Results
   Overall, our findings showed that the network of organizations working on MCH and WASH in Kachhauna grew in number since the implementation of Samuday. HCLF rapidly achieved centrality, thus positioning the organization to serve as a gatekeeper of information and enabling it to play a coordinator role within the network. Direct collaboration between other organizations working on MCH and WASH was low at both time points. Interviews with key informants indicated widespread interest in increasing interorganizational interactions and engagement throughout the network.
   Conclusion
   This study demonstrates the feasibility and practical application of SNA for projects like Samuday that involve intersectoral collaboration. It also provides lessons about the use of SNA with organizations as the unit of analysis and in the context of rural India, including challenges, practical considerations, and limitations.

AB BackgroundTuberculosis (TB) is the infectious disease that kills the most people worldwide. The use of geoepidemiological techniques to demonstrate the dynamics of the disease in vulnerable communities is essential for its control. Thus, this study aimed to identify risk clusters for TB deaths and their variation over time.MethodsThis ecological study considered cases of TB deaths in residents of Londrina, Brazil between 2008 and 2015. We used standard, isotonic scan statistics for the detection of spatial risk clusters. The Poisson discrete model was adopted with the high and low rates option used for 10, 30 and 50% of the population at risk, with circular format windows and 999 replications considered the maximum cluster size. Getis-Ord Gi* (Gi*) statistics were used to diagnose hotspot areas for TB mortality. Kernel density was used to identify whether the clusters changed over time.ResultsFor the standard version, spatial risk clusters for 10, 30 and 50% of the exposed population were 4.9 (95% CI 2.6-9.4), 3.2 (95% CI: 2.1-5.7) and 3.2 (95% CI: 2.1-5.7), respectively. For the isotonic spatial statistics, the risk clusters for 10, 30 and 50% of the exposed population were 2.8 (95% CI: 1.5-5.1), 2.7 (95% CI: 1.6-4.4), 2.2 (95% CI: 1.4-3.9), respectively. All risk clusters were located in the eastern and northern regions of the municipality. Additionally, through Gi*, hotspot areas were identified in the eastern and western regions.ConclusionsThere were important risk areas for tuberculosis mortality in the eastern and northern regions of the municipality. Risk clusters for tuberculosis deaths were observed in areas where TB mortality was supposedly a non-problem. The isotonic and Gi* statistics were more sensitive for the detection of clusters in areas with a low number of cases; however, their applicability in public health is still restricted.

TI Explainable statistical learning in public health for policy

AB BackgroundIn recent years, the availability of publicly available data related to public health has significantly increased. These data have substantial potential to develop public health policy; however, this requires meaningful and insightful analysis. Our aim is to demonstrate how data analysis techniques can be used to address the issues of data reduction, prediction and explanation using online available public health data, in order to provide a sound basis for informing public health policy.MethodsObservational suicide prevention data were analysed from an existing online United Kingdom national public health database. Multi-collinearity analysis and principal-component analysis were used to reduce correlated data, followed by regression analyses for prediction and explanation of suicide.ResultsMulti-collinearity analysis was effective in reducing the indicator set of predictors by 30% and principal component analysis further reduced the set by 86%. Regression for prediction identified four significant indicator predictors of suicide behaviour (emergency hospital admissions for intentional self-harm, children leaving care, statutory homelessness and self-reported well-being/low happiness) and two main component predictors (relatedness dysfunction, and behavioural problems and mental illness). Regression for explanation identified significant moderation of a well-being predictor (low happiness) of suicide behaviour by a social factor (living alone), thereby supporting existing theory and providing insight beyond the results of regression for prediction. Two independent predictors capturing relatedness needs in social care service delivery were also identified.ConclusionsWe demonstrate the effectiveness of regression techniques in the analysis of online public health data. Regression analysis for prediction and explanation can both be appropriate for public health data analysis for a better understanding of public health outcomes. It is therefore essential to clarify the aim of the analysis (prediction accuracy or theory development) as a basis for choosing the most appropriate model. We apply these techniques to the analysis of suicide data; however, we argue that the analysis presented in this study should be applied to datasets across public health in order to improve the quality of health policy recommendations.

AB Background: Newborn screening (NBS) occupies a unique space at the intersection of translational science and public health. As the only truly population-based public health program in the United States, NBS offers the promise of making the successes of translational medicine available to every infant with a rare disorder that is difficult to diagnose clinically, but for which strong evidence indicates that presymptomatic treatment will substantially improve outcomes. Realistic NBS policy requires data, but rare disorders face a special challenge: Screening cannot be done without supportive data, but adequate data cannot be collected in the absence of large-scale screening. The magnitude and scale of research to provide this expanse of data require working with public health programs, but most do not have the resources or mandate to conduct research.
   Methods: To address this gap, we have established Early Check, a research program in partnership with a state NBS program. Early Check provides the infrastructure needed to identify conditions for which there have been significant advances in treatment potential, but require a large-scale, population-based study to test benefits and risks, demonstrate feasibility, and inform NBS policy.
   Discussion: Our goal is to prove the benefits of a program that can, when compared with current models, accelerate understanding of diseases and treatments, reduce the time needed to consider inclusion of appropriate conditions in the standard NBS panel, and accelerate future research on new NBS conditions, including clinical trials for investigational interventions.

AB Background: Since the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola epidemic, the concept of measuring health security capacity has become increasingly important within the broader context of health systems-strengthening, enhancing responses to public health emergencies, and reducing global catastrophic biological risks. Efforts to regularly and sustainably track the evolution of health security capabilities and capacities over time - while also accounting for political, social, and environmental risks - could help countries progress toward eliminating sources of health insecurity. We sought to aggregate evidence-based principles that capture a country's baseline public health and healthcare capabilities, its health security system performance before and during infectious disease crises, and its broader social, political, security, and ecological risk environments.
   Methods: We conducted a scoping review of English-language scholarly and gray literature to identify evidence- and practice-based indicators and proxies for measuring health security at the country level over time. We then used a qualitative coding framework to identify recurrent themes in the literature and synthesize foundational principles for measuring global health security. Documents reviewed included English-language literature published after 2001 until the end of the research period-September 2017-to ensure relevance to the current global health security landscape; literature examining acute infectious disease threats with potential for transnational spread; and literature addressing global health security efforts at the country level.
   Results: We synthesized four foundational principles for measuring global health security: measurement requires assessment of existing capacities, as well as efforts to build core public health, healthcare, and biosecurity capabilities; assessments of national programs and efforts to mitigate a critical subset of priority threats could inform efforts to generate useful metrics for global health security; there are measurable enabling factors facilitating health security-strengthening efforts; and finally, measurement requires consideration of social, political, and ecological risk environments.
   Conclusion: The themes identified in this review could inform efforts to systematically assess the impacts and effectiveness of activities undertaken to strengthen global health security.

AB Background: The rapid growth and changes that occur in adolescents increase the demand for macro and micronutrients and addressing their needs particularly in females would be an important step to break the vicious cycle of intergenerational malnutrition. Thus we evaluated the status of anemia and its anthropometric, dietary and socio demographic determinants in female adolescents, west Ethiopia.
   Methods: A school based cross-sectional study was conducted among school going adolescent girls of Wayu Tuqa district, south west Ethiopia and a 3-stage random sampling technique was used to select study participants. Data were entered into EpiData version 3.1 and analyzed using STATA version12. Haemoglobin was measured by HemoCue 301+ photometer and WHO Anthro-plus software Version 1.0.4 was used to calculate BMI for age z-score. Both bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to check associations and control confounding. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically.
   Result: The overall prevalence of anemia was 27% (95% CI: 22.9-31%) of which 23, and 4% had mild and moderate anemia respectively. The proportion of thinness and overweight girls based on the BMI for age z-score was 33 and 3.6%, respectively. The odds of developing anemia were almost four times more likely among late adolescents as compared to early adolescents (AOR = 3.8 95%CI = 2.3 to 8.5).Adolescents from rural areas were 3.4 times more likely to have anemia as compared to their urban counterparts (AOR = 3.4 95%CI = 1.9 to 7) and adolescents those who attained menarche were two times more likely to develop anemia compared to those who did not attained menarche (AOR = 2.3 95%CI = 1.34 to 4.2).
   Conclusion: The prevalence of anemia among adolescent girls was a moderate public health problem. To improve the prevailing nutritional problem, there must be inter-sectorial collaboration among health sectors and education sectors in providing nutritional education and counseling based on age and menarche status.

TI Why video health education messages should be considered for all dental
   waiting rooms
SO PLOS ONE

AB Objective
   Video is an effective, accessible, and low cost method of delivering health education messages to a wide audience. Dental waiting rooms provide an opportunity to deliver video oral health education interventions to receptive viewers. In this study we aim to evaluate firstly video oral health education in regards to patient preference, and secondly its ability to change both immediate and sustained self-reported intended health behaviours by patients.
   Method
   Data from 253 individuals from a public hospital dental waiting room were gathered using a previously validated survey following an oral health education video intervention, and analysed using descriptive analysis, Fischer's Exact Test, and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test across 3 time intervals.
   Results
   Participants across all ages evaluated the video oral health education approach as easy to follow and understand (p<0.001), the content practical and useful (p<0.001), and that it was a better experience (p<0.01). Those watching between 5 and 20 minutes reported that video was the best format to present oral care information (p<0.02). At follow up, significant improvement in the tools used by participants to clean teeth was seen (39.8%, p<0.001), as well as reported reduction in sweet consumption frequency (21.3%, p<0.001) and in smoking (44.8%, p<0.02).
   Conclusion
   Video format oral health education used in dental waiting rooms was found to be effective in educating patients and instigating both immediate and sustained self-reported behaviour change. Significant improvement in tools used for oral hygiene and a reduction in sweets consumption were demonstrated, both of which are essential factors in reducing caries rates and improving oral health.

ID PREHOSPITAL CARE; SERVICES EMS; MORTALITY; DISASTER; TRAUMA
AB BackgroundIn Iran, Road Traffic Injuries (RTIs) with mass casualties occur repeatedly. Since Road Traffic Accidents (RTAs) occur far from health facilities, EMSs play an important role in reducing the disability and mortality resulting from RTIs. Thus, the study aimed to report Iraqi pilgrims' bus which rolled over in the Malayer town.Case presentationA mass casualty event occurred on 7 September 2017 when a bus full of Iraqi pilgrims rolled over on a road 4-km outside of Malayer, Iran. A large team of responders were dispatched including 5 ambulances with 10 EMTs along with 6 police officers serving in the area. The accident resulted in 35 injured patients (21 female and 14 male) as well as 11 deaths ranging in age from 2 to 65years. Twenty-one of the injured were transported to the hospital and 14 patients refused transport and 12 patients sustained multiple trauma. The case has been described four phases of dispatch, on-scene, hospital and post-mission. Frequent calls made by laypeople were considered as the main challenge of dispatch phase. The response on scene was hampered by large numbers of lay bystanders. The over-crowding around the emergency units disrupted the medical care procedures in hospital phase.ConclusionThis case highlights over-crowding and laypeople interference at the scene disrupts the relief and rescue. To solve these challenges, the public education and police monitoring and control is recommended. Establishing a unified command post at the scene can facilitate effective coordination among relief and rescue organizations.

DT Article
DE Public health economics; Modelling; Economic modelling; Non-communicable
   disease; Diet; Physical activity; Public health
AB BackgroundNon-communicable diseases are the leading cause of death in England, and poor diet and physical inactivity are two of the principle behavioural risk factors. In the context of increasingly constrained financial resources, decision makers in England need to be able to compare the potential costs and health outcomes of different public health policies aimed at improving these risk factors in order to know where to invest so that they can maximise population health. This paper describes PRIMEtime CE, a multistate life table cost-effectiveness model that can directly compare interventions affecting multiple disease outcomes.MethodsThe multistate life table model, PRIMEtime Cost Effectiveness (PRIMEtime CE), is developed from the Preventable Risk Integrated ModEl (PRIME) and the PRIMEtime model. PRIMEtime CE uses routinely available data to estimate how changing diet and physical activity in England affects morbidity and mortality from heart disease, stroke, diabetes, liver disease, and cancers either directly or via raised blood pressure, cholesterol, and body weight.ResultsModel outcomes are change in quality adjusted life years, and change in English National Health Service and social care costs.ConclusionThis paper describes PRIMEtime CE and highlights its main strengths and limitations. The model can be used to compare any number of public policies affecting diet and physical activity, allowing decision makers to understand how they can maximise population health with limited financial resources.

   SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; DISEASE; INTERVENTIONS; CLUSTERS
AB BackgroundPRIMEtime CE is a multistate life table model that can directly compare the cost effectiveness of public health interventions affecting diet and physical activity levels, helping to inform decisions about how to spend finite resources. This paper estimates the costs and health outcomes in England of two scenarios: reformulating salt and expanding subsidised access to leisure centres. The results are used to help validate PRIMEtime CE, following the steps outlined in the Assessment of the Validation Status of Health-Economic decision models (AdViSHE) tool.MethodsThe PRIMEtime CE model estimates the difference in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and difference in NHS and social care costs of modelled interventions compared with doing nothing. The salt reformulation scenario models how salt consumption would change if food producers met the 2017 UKFood Standards Agency salt reformulation targets. The leisure centre scenario models change in physical activity levels if the BirminghamBe Active scheme (where swimming pools and gym access is free to residents during defined periods) was rolled out across England.The AdViSHE tool was developed by health economic modellers and divides model validation into five parts: validation of the conceptual model, input data validation, validation of computerised model, operational validation, and other validation techniques. PRIMEtime CE is discussed in relation to each part.ResultsSalt reformulation was dominant compared with doing nothing, and had a 10-year return on investment of 1.44 (0.50 to 2.94) pound for every 1 pound spent. By contrast, over 10years the Be Active expansion would cost 727,000 pound (514,000 pound to 1,064,000) pound per QALY. PRIMEtime CE has good face validity of its conceptual model and has robust input data. Cross-validation produces mixed results and shows the impact of model scope, input parameters, and model structure on cost-per-QALY estimates.Conclusions This paper illustrates how PRIMEtime CE can be used to compare the cost-effectiveness of two different public health measures affecting diet and physical activity levels. The AdViSHE tool helps to validate PRIMEtime CE, identifies some of the key drivers of model estimates, and highlights the challenges of externally validating public health economicmodels against independent data.

AB Background: This paper reports on a rigorously designed non-masked randomized cluster trial of the childhood survival impact of deploying paid community health workers to provide doorstep preventive, promotional, and curative antenatal, newborn, child, and reproductive health care in three rural Tanzanian districts.
   Methods: From August, 2011 to June 2015 ongoing demographic surveillance on 380,000 individuals permitted monitoring of neonatal, infant and under-5 mortality rates for 50 randomly selected intervention and 51 comparison villages. Over the initial 2 years of the project, logistics and supply support systems were managed by the Ifakara Health Institute. In 2013, the experiment transitioned its operational design to logistical support managed by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare with the goal of enhancing government operational ownership and utilization of results for policy.
   Results: The baseline under 5 mortality rate was 81.3 deaths per 1000 live births with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 77.2-85.6 in the intervention group and 82.7/1000 (95% CI 78.5-87.1) in the comparison group yielding an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.99 (95% CI 0.88-1.11, p=0.867). After 4 years of implementation, the under 5 mortality rate was 73.2/1000 (95% CI 69.3-77.3) in the intervention group and 77.4/1000 (95% CI 73.8-81.1) in the comparison group (adjusted HR 0.95 [95% CI 0.86-1.07], p=0.443). The intervention had no impact on neonatal mortality in either the first 2 years (HR 1.10 [95% CI 0.89-1.36], p=.392) or last 2 years of implementation (HR 0.98 [95% CI 0.74-1.30], p=.902). Although community health worker deployment significantly reduced mortality among children aged 1-59months during the first 2 years of implementation (HR 0.85 [95% CI 0.76-0.96], p=0.008), mortality among post neonates was the same in both groups in years three and four (HR 1.03 [95% CI 0.85-1.24], p=0.772). Results adjusted for stock-outeffects show that diminishing impact was associated with logistics system lapses that constrained worker access to essential drugs and increased post-neonatal mortality risk in the final two project years (HR 1.42 [95% CI 1.07-1.88], p=0.015).
   Conclusions: Community health worker home-visit deployment had a null effect among neonates, and 2 years of initial impact among children over 1 month of age, but a null effect when tests were based on over 1 month of age data merged for all four project years. The atrophy of under age five effects arose because workers were not continuously equipped with essential medicines in years three and four. Analyses that controlled for stock-out effects suggest that adequately supplied workers had survival effects on children aged 1 to 59months.

ID DETERMINANTS
AB Background: World Health Organization (WHO) predicted that there will be a shortfall of skilled healthcare by 2035 with the greatest shortfall in Africa and Southeast Asia due to satisfaction with payment and incentives. Low job satisfaction of health workers can result in increased staff turnover and absenteeism, which affects the efficiency of health services. Ethiopia has been affected by a shortage of health professionals due to a brain drain of health professionals. Our study, therefore, aimed at assessing the impact of the working environment and benefits packages on the level of satisfaction among health professionals working in selected public Health facilities in Eastern Ethiopia.
   Methods: Institutional based Cross-sectional study design was conducted among 422 selected health professionals in Bale Zone Public Health Facilities. After selecting 2 hospitals and 32 health centers by lottery method, proportional allocation of the sample was done for selected Hospitals and Health Centers. Then, to select individual health professional from each health center and hospital, a systematic sampling method was employed using the worker's registration log book. Then, data were collected, cleaned and entered into EpiData software version 3.1 and then exported to IBM SPSS version 21 for analysis. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were done. The principal component analysis was employed for all Likert scale instruments to extract factor(s) representing each of the scales and have factor scores, which facilitate treatment of the variables as continuous during further analysis. Using this regression factor score, multiple linear regression analysis was performed and the effect of independent variables on the regression factor score of the outcome variable was quantified. A significance level of less than 0.05 was used in all cases to judge statistical significance.
   Result: This study showed that the prevalence of job satisfaction of health professionals was 38.5% (95%CI: 33.82-43.2%). Age of health professionals ((beta=0.252, (95% CI: 0.067, 0.437))), type of health facility (beta=-0.280, (95% CI; -0.519, -0.041), service year (beta=0.487, (95%CI: 0.025, 0.998)), supply they need to do their job (beta=0.10, (95% CI: 0.009 to 0.19)), perception of health professional on allowances (beta=-0.216, (95% CI: -0.306, -0.125)) and perception of health professionals on employment benefits (beta=0.225, (95% CI: 0.135 to 0.315)) were statistically significant that affect job satisfaction factor score.
   Conclusion: level of job satisfaction of health professionals was found to be low. Level of job satisfaction was influenced by the age of the health professionals, type of health facility in which they were working, years of service they had in the health sectors, their working environment, professional allowance and benefits like financial rewards and benefits of being employed. Hence, policy makers and health managers need to pay special attention to increase the satisfaction of the health workforce at all levels in the health system. Moreover, special emphasis should be given for the benefits packages of health workers at different levels.

AB BackgroundEngaging communities in community-based health research is increasingly being adopted in low- and middle-income countries. The use of community advisory boards (CABs) is one method of practicing community involvement in health research. To date, few studies provide in-depth accounts of the strategies that CAB members use to practice community engagement. We assessed the perspectives, experiences and practices of the first local CAB in Eswatini (formerly known as Swaziland), which was implemented as part of the MaxART Early Access to ART for All study.MethodsTrained Swazi research assistants conducted two focus group discussions and 13 semi-structured interviews with CAB members who had been part of the MaxART study for at least 2.5years. Interviews explored CAB composition and recruitment, the activities of CAB members, the mechanisms used to engage with communities and the challenges they faced in their role.ResultsThe MaxART CAB played an active role in the implementation of the Early Access to Art for All study, and activities mainly focused on: (1) promoting ethical conduct, in particular privacy, consent and confidentiality; (2) communication and education, communicating about the study and educating the community on the benefits of HIV testing and early access to HIV treatment; and (3) liaising between the community and the research team. Strategies for interacting with communities were varied and included attending general community meetings, visiting health facilities and visiting public places such as cattle dipping tanks, buses, bars and churches. Differences in the approach to community engagement between CAB members living in the study areas and those residing outside were identified.ConclusionThe experiences of the first CAB in Eswatini demonstrate that community engagement using CABs is a valuable mechanism for engaging communities in implementation studies. Considerations that could impact CAB functioning include clearly defining the scope of the CAB, addressing issues of CAB independence, the CAB budget, providing emotional support for CAB members, and providing continuous training and capacity building. These issues should be addressed during the early stages of CAB formation in order to optimize functioning.

AB Background
   Incarceration and HIV disproportionately impact African American communities. The mass incarceration of African American men is hypothesized to increase HIV acquisition risk for African American women. Interventions optimizing HIV care engagement and minimizing sexual risk behaviors for men living with HIV post-incarceration may decrease HIV incidence.
   Methods
   Using an agent-based model, we simulated a sexual and injection drug using network representing the African American population of Philadelphia. We compared intervention strategies for men living with HIV post-incarceration by the number of averted HIV transmissions to women within the community. Three interventions were evaluated: a 90-90-90 scenario scaling up HIV testing, ART provision, and ART adherence; a behavioral intervention decreasing sexual risk behaviors; and a combination intervention involving both.
   Results
   The status quo scenario projected 2,836 HIV transmissions to women over twenty years. HIV transmissions to women decreased by 29% with the 90-90-90 intervention, 23% with the behavioral intervention, and 37% with both. The number of men living with HIV receiving the intervention needed in order to prevent a single HIV transmission ranged between 6 and 10.
   Conclusion
   Interventions to improve care engagement and decrease sexual risk behaviors post-incarceration for men living with HIV have the potential to decrease HIV incidence within African American heterosexual networks.

AB In the border region between Brazil and French Guiana, American cutaneous leishmaniasis is a worrisome public health issue, and entomological studies are required there to better identify classical and putative emerging transmission patterns. The present study aimed to detect and characterize Leishmania DNA in the phlebotomine population of Oiapoque (Amapa State, Brazil). Phlebotomines were captured in anthropized and wild environments in the outskirts of Oiapoque municipality, using CDC light traps installed in vertical (ground/canopy level) and horizontal (peridomicile/extradomicile/forest-edge/forest) strata. Captured specimens were identified according to their morphology. Females were processed for Leishmania DNA detection and characterization using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction targeting kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) and the phlebotomine cacophony gene. The kDNA positive samples were characterized by cloning and sequencing the Leishmania 234 bp-hsp70 gene. Among the 3957 phlebotomine specimens captured, 26 pooled female samples were positive for Leishmania (Viannia) spp. DNA. Sequencing analysis allowed species-specific identification of L. (V.) braziliensis DNA in Trichophoromyia ininii, Bichromomyia flaviscutellata, Nyssomyia umbratilis, and Evandromyia infraspinosa, and L. (V.) guyanensis DNA in Ny. umbratilis. A pooled sample of Ny. umbratilis was positive for both L. (V.) braziliensis and L. (V.) guyanensis DNA. The present study provided additional information regarding ACL ecology in Oiapoque, highlighting the presence of L. (V.) braziliensis DNA in different phlebotomine species. The epidemiological implications of these findings and the determinant incrimination of L. (V.) braziliensis as proven vectors in that region must be clarified. In this regard, studies on Leishmania spp. infection and suggestive anthropophilic behavior of associated phlebotomines need to be prioritized in entomological surveillance.

AB BackgroundAt the end of life, about 85-90% of patients can be treated within primary palliative care (PC) provided by general practitioners (GPs). In Germany, there is no structured approach for the provision of PC by GPs including a systematic as well as timely identification of patients who might benefit from PC, yet. The project Optimal care at the end of life (OPAL) focusses on an improvement of primary PC for patients with both oncological and non-oncological chronic progressive diseases in their last phase of life provided by GPs and health care services.MethodsOPAL will take place in Hameln-Pyrmont, a rural region in Lower Saxony, Germany. Target groups are (a) GPs, (b) relatives of deceased patients and (c) health care providers. The study follows a three-phase approach in a mixed-methods and pre-post design. In phase I (baseline, t(0)) we explore the usual practice of providing PC for patients with chronic progressive diseases by GPs and the collaboration with other health care providers. In phase II (intervention) the Supportive and Palliative Care Indicators Tool (SPICT) for the timely identification of patients who might benefit from PC will be implemented and tested in general practices. Furthermore, a public campaign will be started to inform stakeholders, to connect health care providers and to train change agents. In phase III (follow-up, t(1)) we investigate the potential effect of the intervention to evaluate differences in the provision of PC by GPs and to convey factors for the implementation of SPICT in general practices.DiscussionThe project OPAL is the first study to implement the SPICT-DE regionwide in general practices in Germany. The project OPAL may contribute to an overall optimisation of primary PC for patients in Germany by reducing GPs' uncertainty in initiating PC, by consolidating their skills and competencies in identifying patients who might benefit from PC, and by improving the cooperation between GPs and different health care stakeholders.Trial registrationThe study was retrospectively registered at the German Clinical Trials Register (Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien; trial registration number: DRKS00015108; date of registration: 22th of January 2019).

AB BackgroundChildhood overweight and obesity is a serious public health issue with an increase being observed in preschool-aged children. Treating childhood obesity is difficult and few countries use standardized treatments. Therefore, there is a need to find effective approaches that are feasible for both health care providers and families. Thus, the overall aim of this study is to assess the acceptance and effectiveness of a parent support program (the More and Less, ML) for the management of overweight and obesity followed by a mobile health (mHealth) program (the MINISTOP application) in a socially diverse population of families.Methods/designA two-arm, parallel design randomized controlled trial in 300 2-to 6-year-old children with overweight and obesity from Romania, Spain and Sweden (n=100 from each). Following baseline assessments children are randomized into the intervention or control group in a 1:1 ratio. The intervention, the ML program, consists of 10-weekly group sessions which focus on evidence-based parenting practices, followed by the previously validated MINISTOP application for 6-months to support healthy eating and physical activity behaviors. The primary outcome is change in body mass index (BMI) z-score after 9-months and secondary outcomes include: waist circumference, eating behavior (Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire), parenting behavior (Comprehensive Feeding Practices Questionnaire), physical activity (ActiGraph wGT3x-BT), dietary patterns (based onmetabolic markers from urine and 24h dietary recalls), epigenetic and gut hormones (fasting blood samples), and the overall acceptance of the overweight and obesity management in young children (semi-structured interviews). Outcomes are measured at baseline and after: 10-weeks (only BMI z-score, waist circumference), 9-months (all outcomes), 15- and 21-months (all outcomes except physical activity, dietary patterns, epigenetics and gut hormones) post-baseline.DiscussionThis study will evaluate a parent support program for weight management in young children in three European countries. To boost the effect of the ML program the families will be supported by an app for 6-months. If the program is found to be effective, it has the potential to be implemented into routine care to reduce overweight and obesity in young children and the app could prove to be a viable option for sustained effects of the care provided.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT03800823; 11 Jan 2019.

AB BackgroundCommunity-driven projects that aim to address public concerns about health risks from H. pylori infection in Indigenous Arctic communities (estimated H. pylori prevalence=64%) show frequent failure of treatment to eliminate the bacterium. Among project participants, treatment effectiveness is reduced by antibiotic resistance of infecting H. pylori strains, which in turn, is associated with frequent exposure to antibiotics used to treat other infections. This analysis compares antibiotic dispensation rates in Canadian Arctic communities to rates in urban and rural populations in Alberta, a southern Canadian province.MethodsProject staff collected antibiotic exposure histories for 297 participants enrolled during 2007-2012 in Aklavik, Tuktoyaktuk, and Fort McPherson in the Northwest Territories, and Old Crow, Yukon. Medical chart reviews collected data on systemic antibiotic dispensations for the 5-year period before enrolment for each participant. Antibiotic dispensation data for urban Edmonton, Alberta (average population 860,000) and rural northern Alberta (average population 450,000) during 2010-2013 were obtained from the Alberta Government Interactive Health Data Application.ResultsAntibiotic dispensation rates, estimated as dispensations/person-years (95% confidence interval) were: in Arctic communities, 0.89 (0.84, 0.94); in Edmonton, 0.55 (0.55, 0.56); in rural northern Alberta, 0.63 (0.62, 0.63). Antibiotic dispensation rates were higher in women and older age groups in all regions. In all regions, the highest dispensation rates occurred for beta-lactam and macrolide antibiotic classes.ConclusionsThese results show more frequent antibiotic dispensation in Arctic communities relative to an urban and rural southern Canadian population.

AB BackgroundDepression and anxiety are two of the leading causes of disease burden in low-to-middle income coutnries. The World Health Organisation has engaged in a programme of scaling-up mental health services, but significant challenges remain. Improving mental health literacy in children and young people, a core part of recent, global health strategies has the potential to address some of these challenges. The study aims to co-develop and feasibility test, a culturally-appropriate toolkit to promote depression and anxiety focused mental health literacy and self-management skills in Indonesia, for children aged 11-15years.MethodsA mixed methods study comprising four phases. Through a systematic review of existing evidence, phase 1 will review approaches to improve mental health literacy and self-management in South East Asia and critically review current evidence regarding intervention effect. Phase 2 will explore stakeholders' views on depression, anxiety and mental health more broadly and identify priorities for the intervention through the use of semi-structured interviews and/or focus groups with policy makers, clinicians, teachers, adolescent service users, carers and young people aged 11-15. Phase 3 will comprise iterative workshops with local stakeholders to present our findings and co-produce a testable, culturally appropriate toolkit to promote mental health literacy and depression/anxiety focused self-management in 11-15year olds in Java, Indonesia. Phase 4 comprises feasibility evaluation of our developed intervention via nine in-depth case studies (Jakarta, Bogor and Magelang). We will examine the impact, acceptability and feasibility of our prototype intervention and produce evidence-based guidelines for wider implementation.DiscussionTools to support mental health literacy and self-management are a low cost way in which mental health services in LMICs can attempt to address the burden of anxiety and depression amongst children and young people. However, this is an underexplored area in Indonesia. Working closely with local stakeholders, this study will design and undertake feasibility evaluation of co-produced mental health literacy and anxiety and depression focussed interactive self-management tools.This abstract has also been published on the funders website (UK Research and Innovation. Improving Mental Health Literacy Among Young People aged 12-15 years in Indonesia 2019).

AB BackgroundFacing the increasing cancer incidence and cancer survivorship, many national strategic cancer plans have identified cancer care coordination as a priority for health service improvement. However, the high variability of practices, the diversity of definitions and underlying concepts increases the existing difficulty to standardise, replicate, transpose and assess care coordination within the French health system context. The EPOCK national study aims at evaluating practices and the working context of hospital-based cancer care coordination nurses, based on a previously designed reference framework for care coordination within the French health system context.MethodsEPOCK is based on a comprehensive evaluation of nursing professions in cancer care coordination, considered as a complex intervention. Phase 1 (theoretical phase) will define and design a theoretical reference framework for care coordination in France through an international literature review, aiming to identify relevant models and all components of the expected framework and a structured consensus method, the Nominal group technique, aiming to select and prioritise the most relevant components already found in the literature review with regard to the French healthcare system; phase 2 (Operational phase) will consist in an in-depth analysis of practices, contexts, perceptions and attitudes related to care coordination occupations by nurses in oncology and all stakeholders (related professionals, patients and their caregivers) through a multicentric cross-sectional mixed-method evaluative study. The observed practices and contexts will be finally compared with the theoretical reference framework using both inductive and deductive approaches.DiscussionThis study will result in an evaluation framework identifying key models and key elements relative to cancer care coordination interventions that can be used to guide management of cancer care coordination nursing occupations within the French healthcare system. EPOCK would also assist in public decision-making to identify optimal targets, skills profiles and scope of actions for cancer coordination professions. Finally, EPOCK will describe typology of nurse practices in cancer care coordination and thus obtain precise preliminary information essential for drafting a medico-economic evaluation study of these new nursing professions' impact.Trial registrationClinicaltrial.gov registration: NCT03350776, 11/22/2017.

AB BackgroundTuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death for individuals infected with Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Conversely, HIV is the most important risk factor in the progression of TB from the latent to the active status. In order to manage this double epidemic situation, an integrated approach that includes HIV management in TB patients was proposed by the World Health Organization and was implemented in Uganda (one of the countries endemic with both diseases). To enable targeted intervention using the integrated approach, areas with high disease prevalence rates for TB and HIV need to be identified first. However, there is no such study in Uganda, addressing the joint spatial patterns of these two diseases.MethodsThis study uses global Moran's index, spatial scan statistics and bivariate global and local Moran's indices to investigate the geographical clustering patterns of both diseases, as individuals and as combined. The data used are TB and HIV case data for 2015, 2016 and 2017 obtained from the District Health Information Software 2 system, housed and maintained by the Ministry of Health, Uganda.ResultsResults from this analysis show that while TB and HIV diseases are highly correlated (55-76%), they exhibit relatively different spatial clustering patterns across Uganda. The joint TB/HIV prevalence shows consistent hotspot clusters around districts surrounding Lake Victoria as well as northern Uganda. These two clusters could be linked to the presence of high HIV prevalence among the fishing communities of Lake Victoria and the presence of refugees and internally displaced people camps, respectively. The consistent cold spot observed in eastern Uganda and around Kasese could be explained by low HIV prevalence in communities with circumcision tradition.ConclusionsThis study makes a significant contribution to TB/HIV public health bodies around Uganda by identifying areas with high joint disease burden, in the light of TB/HIV co-infection. It, thus, provides a valuable starting point for an informed and targeted intervention, as a positive step towards a TB and HIV-AIDS free community.

AB BackgroundThe major infectious diseases of hepatitis B has constituted an acute public health challenge in China. An effective and affordable HBV control model is urgently needed. A national project of Community-based Collaborative Innovation HBV (CCI-HBV) demonstration areas has optimized the existing community healthcare resources and obtained initial results in HBV control.MethodsBased on the existing community healthcare network, CCI-HBV project combined the community health management and health contract signing service for long-staying residents in hepatitis B screening. Moreover, HBV field research strategy was popularized in CCI-HBV areas. After screening, patients with seropositive results were enrolled in corresponding cohorts and received treatment at an early stage. And the uninfected people received medical supports including health education through new media, behavior intervention and HBV vaccinations. In this process, a cloud-based National Information Platform (NIP) was established to collect and store residents' epidemiological data. In addition, a special quality control team was set up for CCI project.ResultsAfter two rounds of screening, HBsAg positive rate dropped from 5.05% (with 5,173,003 people screened) to 4.57% (with 3,819,675 people screened), while the rate of new HBV infections was 0.28 per 100 person-years in the fixed cohorts of 2,584,322 people. The quality control team completed PPS sampling simultaneously and established the serum sample database with 2,800,000 serum samples for unified testing.ConclusionsCCI-HBV project has established a large-scale field research to conduct whole-population screening and intervention. We analyzed the HBsAg prevalence and new infection rate of HBV in the fixed population for the epidemic trend and intervention effect. The purpose of CCI-HBV project is to establish and evaluate a practical model of grid management and field strategy, to realize the new goal to control hepatitis B in China. To provide policymakers with a feasible model, our results are directly applicable.Trial registrationThe project was funded by the Major Projects of Science Research for the 11th and 12th five-year plans of China, entitled The prevention and control of AIDS, viral hepatitis and other major infectious diseases, Grant Nos. 2009ZX10004901, 2011ZX10004901, 2013ZX10004904, 2014ZX10004007 and 2014ZX10004008.

TI Expenditure variations analysis using residuals for identifying high

AB BackgroundHigh utilizers receive great attention in health care research because they have a largely disproportionate spending. Existing analyses usually identify high utilizers with an empirical threshold on the number of health care visits or associated expenditures. However, such count-and-cost based criteria might not be best for identifying impactable high utilizers.MethodsWe propose an approach to identify impactable high utilizers using residuals from regression-based health care utilization risk adjustment models to analyze the variations in health care expenditures. We develop linear and tree-based models to best adjust per-member per-month health care cost by clinical and socioeconomic risk factors using a large administrative claims dataset from a state public insurance program.ResultsThe risk adjustment models identify a group of patients with high residuals whose demographics and categorization of comorbidities are similar to other patients but who have a significant amount of unexplained health care utilization. Deeper analysis of the essential hypertension cohort and chronic kidney disease cohort shows these variations in expenditures could be within individual ICD-9-CM codes and from different mixtures of ICD-9-CM codes. Additionally, correlation analysis with 3M (TM) Potentially Preventable Events (PPE) software shows that a portion of this utilization may be preventable. In addition, the high utilizers persist from year to year.ConclusionsAfter risk adjustment, patients with higher than expected expenditures (high residuals) are associated with more potentially preventable events. These residuals are temporally consistent and hence may be useful in identifying and intervening impactable high utilizers.

AB Background: Unintentional child poisoning represents a significant public health problem across the globe, placing a substantial burden on health services emergency departments. Around the world, every year, thousands of children die as a result of physical injuries, most of which involve children under 5 years old. Medicines are the main products involved in poisoning, and children under 5 years old are the most vulnerable age group. The objective of this study was to measure the prevalence of unsafe storage of medicines in households with a 4-year-old child.
   Methods: We used data from the follow-up of 4-year-old in the 2004 Pelotas Birth Cohort Study in Brazil (N=3799). "Unsafe storage" was considered present when medicines were stored unlocked and within reach of children (at a height below the eye level of the average adult). Independent variables included maternal and family socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and the child's health care. All information was collected during household interviews with the mothers using a standardized questionnaire. The overall prevalence rate with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and the prevalence associated with various independent variables were determined.
   Results: The storage of medicines in unlocked areas was reported by 80.9% of the mothers, and, within reach of children for 26.5%. The overall prevalence rate of unsafe storage of medicines was 21.4% (20.1-22.7%). The main storage locations used were the kitchen (57.0%) and bedroom (53.3%).
   Conclusions: The results indicate that medicines were unsafely stored in a 21.4% number of homes, which can contribute to the vulnerability of children to poisoning from medicines. To minimize this risk, education about the safe storage of medicines should be reinforced by health professionals.

AB BackgroundThe diagnosis of pertussis in clinical practice continues to be a challenge worldwide as the symptoms are variable. We aimed to determine the prevalence of pertussis in Chinese children irrespective of cough duration and explore the clinical characteristics of children with pertussis with different cough durations.MethodsThis was a prospective study of children 1month to 11years of age with different cough durations in one large Chinese hospital. Bilateral deep posterior nasopharyngeal swabs and venepuncture for full blood count, CRP and serology and sputum were obtained when possible for investigation. E-test strips were used for testing the susceptibility of the B.pertussis isolates against erythromycin, azithromycin, sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim, levofloxacin, amoxicillin and doxycycline. Demographic, clinical and laboratory information on culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was collected from children, and analyzed using SAS v.10 (SAS Institute Inc., USA).ResultsAfter exclusions we analyzed 312 children. Ninety-seven (31.1%) children had laboratory evidence of pertussis. When grouped by cough duration, few characteristics were significant between children with and without pertussis. Of the 36 isolates, 72.2% (26/36)could not be inhibited by erythromycin and azithromycin at all. The MIC50 and MIC90 to amoxicillin were 0.75mg/L and 1mg/L respectively, sensitive to amoxicillin by the EUCAST points.ConclusionsThe one-size-fits-all clinical pertussis case definition is no longer optimal to recognize this disease. A large comprehensive study of children with all types of cough is required to make substantial inroads into increasing both the sensitivity and specificity in pertussis diagnosis, which will have a beneficial impact on public health. Amoxicillin maybe an alternative for children with marolide-resistant B.pertussis infection; however, local sensitivities are required to inform clinical practice.

AB BackgroundConsumption of fruits and vegetables reduces the risk of obesity, diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality. The study assessed the pattern of intake and the factors that influence daily intake of commonly available fruits and vegetables in economically disadvantaged South African communities.MethodsThis is a cross-sectional study nested on an ongoing longitudinal study in South Africa. Two communities (a rural and urban) of low socio-economic status were purposely selected from two of the nine provinces. A sample of 535 participants aged 30-75years was randomly selected from the longitudinal cohort of 1220; 411 (78%) women. Data were collected using validated food frequency and structured interviewer-administered questionnaires. Descriptive and multivariate regression analysis were undertaken.ResultsA higher proportion of participants in the urban township compared to their rural community counterparts had purchased fruits (93% vs. 51%) and vegetables (62% vs. 56%) either daily or weekly. Only 37.8% of the participants consumed at least two portions of commonly available fruits and vegetables daily, with no differences in the two communities. Daily/weekly purchase of sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) was associated with daily intake of fruits and vegetables (p=0.014). Controlling for age and gender, analysis showed that those who spent R1000 (USD71.4) and more on groceries monthly compared to those who spent less, and those who travelled with a personal vehicle to purchase groceries (compared to those who took public transport) were respectively 1.6 times (AOR, 95% CI: 1.05-2.44; p=0.030) and 2.1 times (AOR, 95% CI: 1.06-4.09; p=0.003) more likely to consume at least two or more portions of fruits and vegetables daily. Those who purchased SSBs daily or weekly were less likely (AOR, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.36-0.81, p=0.007) to consume two or more portions of fruits and vegetables daily. The average household monthly income was very low (only 2.6% of households earned R5000 (US$357.1); and education level, attitude towards fruits and vegetables and owning a refrigerator had no significant association with fruits and vegetable daily intake.ConclusionThese findings indicate that affordability and frequency of purchase of sugary drinks can influence daily intake of fruits and vegetables in resource-limited communities.

TI Breast cancer care in Uganda: A multicenter study on the frequency of
   breast cancer surgery in relation to the incidence of breast cancer
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; DIAGNOSIS; SERIES; HEALTH; BRCA1
AB Background
   Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. Considerable funding and efforts are invested in breast cancer research and healthcare, but only a fraction of this reaches women and healthcare systems in low income countries. Surgical treatment is an essential part of breast cancer care, but access to surgery is in general very limited in low income countries such as Uganda. In this study, the previously unknown nationwide rate of breast cancer surgery was investigated.
   Methods and findings
   This was a multicenter, retrospective study, investigating breast cancer surgery in the public healthcare system in Uganda. Data were collected from operating theater registries at primary, secondary and tertiary level healthcare centres throught the country, including 14 general hospitals, the 14 regional referral hospitals and the national referral hospital. Patients who underwent major surgery for breast cancer at these hospitals during 2013 and 2014 were included. The number of breast cancer procedures performed, geographical variation, level of healthcare staff performing surgery and patient characteristics were investigated. After correction for missing data, a total of 137 breast cancer procedures were performed each year within the public healthcare system, corresponding to 5.7% of the breast cancer incidence in the country at that time. Most procedures (n = 161, 59.0%) were performed at the national referral hospital by qualified surgeons. Many of the patients were young; 30.1% being less than 40 years old. The proportion of male breast cancers in the study was large (6.2%).
   Conclusions
   The rate of breast cancer surgery in Uganda is minimal and in several parts of the country breast cancer surgery is not performed at all. More resources must be directed towards breast cancer in low income countries such as Uganda. The fact that the patients were young calls for further research, prevention and treatment specifically targeting young women in the study setting.

   PARTICLES
AB Exposure to air pollution particulate matter (PM) and tuberculosis (TB) are two of the leading global public health challenges affecting low and middle income countries. An estimated 4.26 million premature deaths are attributable to household air pollution and an additional 4.1 million to outdoor air pollution annually. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infects a large proportion of the world's population with the risk for TB development increasing during immunosuppressing conditions. There is strong evidence that such immunosuppressive conditions develop during household air pollution exposure, which increases rates of TB development. Exposure to urban air pollution has been shown to alter the outcome of TB therapy. Here we examined whether in vitro exposure to urban air pollution PM alters human immune responses to M.tb. PM2.5 and PM10 (aerodynamic diameters <2.5 mu m, <10 mu m) were collected monthly from rainy, cold-dry and warm-dry seasons in Iztapalapa, a highly populated TB-endemic municipality of Mexico City with elevated outdoor air pollution levels. We evaluated the effects of seasonality and size of PM on cytotoxicity and antimycobacterial host immunity in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) release assay (IGRA)+ and IGRA- healthy study subjects. PM10 from cold-dry and warm-dry seasons induced the highest cytotoxicity in PBMC. With the exception of PM2.5 from the cold-dry season, pre-exposure to all seasonal PM reduced M.tb phagocytosis by PBMC. Furthermore, M.tb-induced IFN-gamma production was suppressed in PM2.5 and PM10-pre-exposed PBMC from IGRA+ subjects. This observation coincides with the reduced expression of M.tb-induced T-bet, a transcription factor regulating IFN-gamma expression in T cells. Pre-exposure to PM10 compared to PM2.5 led to greater loss of M.tb growth control. Exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 collected in different seasons differentially impairs M.tb-induced human host immunity, suggesting biological mechanisms underlying altered M.tb infection and TB treatment outcomes during air pollution exposures.

AB Background: Dengue is a major public health problem in the tropics and sub-tropics, but the disease is less known to non-dengue-endemic countries including in Northeast Asia. However, an unexpected dengue outbreak occurred in 2014 in Japan. Given that autochthonous (domestic) dengue cases had not been reported for the past 70 years in Japan, this outbreak was highly unusual and suggests that several environmental factors might have changed in a way that favors vector mosquitoes in the Northeast Asian region.
   Methods: A Climate Risk Factor (CRF) index, as validated in previous work, was constructed using climate and nonclimate factors. This CRF index was compared to the number of reported dengue cases in Tokyo, Japan where the outbreak was observed in 2014. In order to identify high-risk areas, the CRF index was further estimated at the 5 km by 5 km resolution and mapped for Japan and South Korea.
   Results: The high-risk areas determined by the CRF index corresponded well to the provinces where a high number of autochthonous cases were reported during the outbreak in Japan. At the provincial-level, high-risk areas for dengue fever were the Eastern part of Tokyo and Kanakawa, the South-Eastern part of Saitama, and the North-Western part of Chiba. While a relatively small number of high-risk areas were identified in South Korea compared with Japan, the highrisk areas in South Korea include popular tourist destinations where international visitors have been increasing.
   Conclusion: The recent dengue outbreak in Japan may signal that the two adjacent non-dengue-endemic countries are also exposed to the risk of temporal and sporadic behavior of dengue fever. It is critical to understand potential high-risk areas for future outbreaks and to set up appropriate prevention activities at the governmental-level.

AB Background: Patterns of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior have important implications for child health. The purpose of the study was to describe the PA and sedentary behavior among Chinese children.
   Methods: The study analyzed the PA and sedentary behavior status of 38,744 Chinese children aged 6-17 years, based on the data from China National Nutrition and Health Survey (CNNHS) in 2010-2012.
   Results: Chinese children spent 61.6 min/d on school-time PA and the proportion with 60 min and over on schooltime PA was 52.5%. The average transportation time was 38.5 min/d and the main mode for children was walking (50.9%), followed by taking private vehicles (19.4%), taking public transportation (16.4%) and cycling (13.3%). Approximately 70% Chinese children did domestic PA and they spent 17.2 min/d on it. Children spent 2.9 h per day on leisure-time sedentary behaviors and 85.8% of them engaged in sedentary behaviors longer than 2 h/d. The proportion of children participating in leisure-time PA was 35.4% and they performed moderate-to-vigorous PA on 3.4 days per week with average 44.9 min per day. Boys were more active in school-time PA, leisure-time PA and transportation, while girls spent more time on domestic PA and homework. More older children took active transportation and spent more time on domestic PA, leisure-time PA and sedentary behaviors compared with younger children. Children in urban area were more likely to take inactive transportation and participate in leisure-time PA, spent less time on domestic PA while more time on sedentary behaviors compared with their counterpart.
   Conclusions: Chinese children performed little physical activity and spent long time engaging in sedentary behaviors. Their physical activity and sedentary behaviors varied by gender, age and area.

AB BackgroundWith life expectancy continuing to rise in the United Kingdom there is an increasing public health focus on the maintenance of physical independence among all older adults. Identifying interventions that improve physical outcomes in pre-frail and frail older adults is imperative.MethodsA systematic review of the literature 2000 to 2017 following PRISMA guidelines and registered with PROSPERO (no. CRD42016045325).ResultsTen RCT trials fulfilled selection criteria and quality appraisal. The study quality was moderate to good. Interventions included physical activity; nutrition, physical activity combined with nutrition. Interventions that incorporated one or more physical activity components significantly improved physical outcomes in pre-frail and/or frail older adults.ConclusionsPhysical activity interventions are key to maintaining independence in pre-frail and frail older adults. A lack of consensus regarding the definition of frailty, and an absence of core measures to assess this means any attempt to create an optimal intervention will be impeded. This absence may ultimately impact on the ability of older and frail adults to live well and for longer in the community.

AB Background: In Mexico, obesity is a major public health problem; 71% of adults are overweight or obese. The proportion of deliveries by cesarean is also very high (45%). Women of reproductive age with overweight or obesity may be at higher risk of cesarean.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study to test the association between overweight and obesity (using body mass index, BMI) and cesarean delivery in Mexico using data from the 2012 National Survey of Health and Nutrition (ENSANUT). Our sample included women of reproductive age at the time of survey who reported a live birth between 2006 and 2012. We used bivariate statistics and a multivariate logistic regression model to test the association between measured BMI and self-reported cesarean delivery. We included individual, clinical, and household level confounders and used survey weights to produce population estimates.
   Results: Our sample consisted of 4,570 women (population N = 7,447,541). Overall, 44% of the women reported a cesarean at last delivery. We found differences in the proportion of cesarean delivery by BMI group (normal = 39%; 95% CI [35-43]; overweight = 42%; 95% CI [38-45]; obesity = 52%; 95% CI [48-57]; p < 0.001). In multivariable models controlling for socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, we found a strong and independent association between obesity and cesarean delivery among multiparous women, compared with multiparous women with normal BMI (obesity aOR: 1.60; 95% CI [1.21-2.12]).
   Conclusions: We provide new evidence about the proportion of women with overweight and obesity who deliver in Mexico. Multiparous women with obesity are at higher risk of cesarean delivery in Mexico than multiparous women with normal body mass index. Given the high prevalence of both obesity and cesarean delivery in Mexico, this relationship is salient for women, health care providers, and the health system.
   Efforts to reduce the cesarean deliveries rate need to take the obesity epidemic into account.

AB Background
   Childhood obesity is a serious public health challenge and schools have been identified as an ideal place to implement prevention interventions. The aim of this study was to measure the cost-effectiveness of a multi-faceted school-based obesity prevention intervention targeting children aged 6-7 years when compared to 'usual activities'.
   Methods
   A cluster randomised controlled trial in 54 schools across the West Midlands (UK) was conducted. The 12-month intervention aimed to increase physical activity by 30 minutes per day and encourage healthy eating. Costs were captured from a public sector perspective and utility-based health related outcomes measured using the CHU-9D. Multiple imputation using chained equations was used to address missing data. The cost effectiveness was measured at 30 months from baseline using a hierarchical net-benefit regression framework, that controlled for clustering and prespecified covariates. Any uncertainty in the results was characterised using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.
   Results
   At 30 months, the total adjusted incremental mean cost of the intervention was 155 pound (95% confidence interval [CI]: 139 pound, 171) pound, and the incremental mean QALYs gained was 0.006 (95% CI:-0.024, 0.036), per child. The incremental cost-effectiveness at 30 months was 26,815 pound per QALY and using a standard willingness to pay threshold of 30,000 pound per QALY, there was a 52% chance that the intervention was cost-effective.
   Conclusions
   The cost-effectiveness of the school-based WAVES intervention was subject to substantial uncertainty. We therefore recommend more research to explore obesity prevention within schools as part of a wider systems approach to obesity prevention.
   Trial registration
   This paper uses data collected by the WAVES trial: Controlled trials ISRCTN97000586 (registered May 2010).

TI Direct medical and non-medical costs of a one-year care pathway for
   early operable breast cancer: Results of a French multicenter
   prospective study
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID CLINICAL PATHWAY; FOLLOW-UP; WOMEN; POPULATION
AB Introduction
   The organization of health care for breast cancer (BC) constitutes a public health challenge to ensure quality of care, while also controlling expenditure. Few studies have assessed the global care pathway of early BC patients, including a description of direct medical costs and their determinants. The aims of this multicenter prospective study were to describe care pathways of BC patients in a geographic territory and to calculate the global direct costs of early stage BC during the first year following diagnosis.
   Methods
   OPTISOINS01 was a multicenter, prospective, observational study including early BC patients from diagnosis to one-year follow-up. Direct medical costs (in-hospital and out-of-hospital costs, supportive care costs) and direct non-medical costs (transportation and sick leave costs) were calculated by using a cost-of-illness analysis based on a bottom-up approach. Resources consumed were recorded in situ for each patient, using a prospective direct observation method.
   Results
   Data from 604 patients were analyzed. Median direct medical costs of 1 year of management after diagnosis in operable BC patients were (sic)12,250. Factors independently associated with higher direct medical costs were: diagnosis on the basis of clinical signs, invasive cancer, lymph node involvement and conventional hospitalization for surgery. Median sick leave costs were (sic)8,841 per patient and per year. Chemotherapy was an independent determinant of sick leave costs ((sic)3,687/patient/year without chemotherapy versus (sic)10,706 with chemotherapy). Forty percent (n = 242) of patients declared additional personal expenditure of (sic)614/patient/year. No drivers of these costs were identified.
   Conclusion
   Initial stage of disease and the treatments administered were the main drivers of direct medical costs. Direct non-medical costs essentially consisted of sick leave costs, accounting for one-half of direct medical costs for working patients. Out-of-pocket expenditure had a limited impact on the household.

TI How prepared are we for cross-border outbreaks? An exploratory analysis
   of cross-border response networks for outbreaks of multidrug resistant
   microorganisms in the Netherlands and Germany
SO PLOS ONE

AB Background
   The emergence and spread of multidrug resistant microorganisms is a serious threat to transnational public health. Therefore, it is vital that cross-border outbreak response systems are constantly prepared for fast, rigorous, and efficient response. This research aims to improve transnational collaboration by identifying, visualizing, and exploring two cross-border response networks that are likely to unfold during outbreaks involving the Netherlands and Germany.
   Methods
   Quantitative methods were used to explore response networks during a cross-border outbreak of carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae in healthcare settings. Eighty-six Dutch and German health professionals reflected on a fictive but realistic outbreak scenario (response rate approximate to 70%). Data were collected regarding collaborative relationships between stakeholders during outbreak response, prior working relationships, and trust in the networks. Network analysis techniques were used to analyze the networks on the network level (density, centralization, clique structures, and similarity of tie constellations between two networks) and node level (brokerage measures and degree centrality).
   Results
   Although stakeholders mainly collaborate with stakeholders belonging to the same country, transnational collaboration is present in a centralized manner. Integration of the network is reached, since several actors are beneficially positioned to coordinate transnational collaboration. However, levels of trust are moderately low and prior-existing cross-border working relationships are sparse.
   Conclusion Given the explored network characteristics, we conclude that the system has a promising basis to achieve effective coordination. However, future research has to determine what kind of network governance form might be most effective and efficient in coordinating the necessary cross-border response activity. Furthermore, networks identified in this study are not only crucial in times of outbreak containment, but should also be fostered in times of non-crisis.

TI The contexts of heavy drinking: A systematic review of the combinations
   of context-related factors associated with heavy drinking occasions
SO PLOS ONE

DT Review
ID BLOOD-ALCOHOL CONCENTRATIONS; EVENT-LEVEL ASSOCIATIONS; BINGE DRINKING;
   COLLEGE-STUDENT; PRE-DRINKING; WEEKEND DRINKING; MOTIVES MODERATE;
   PUBLIC-HEALTH; DAILY DIARY; CONSUMPTION
AB Background
   The amount of alcohol consumed during an occasion can be influenced by physical and social attributes of the setting, characteristics and state of individuals, and the interactions of these components. This systematic review identifies and describes the specific combinations and sequences of context-related factors that are associated with heavy drinking occasions.
   Materials and methods
   We conducted a systematic literature search of MEDLINE, Embase and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases. Eligible articles were event-level and event-based studies that quantitatively analysed associations of sequences or combinations of context-related factors with event-level alcohol consumption. We extracted information on study design, sample, variables, effect estimates and analytical methods. We compiled a list of combinations and sequences associated with heavier drinking (i.e., 'risky contexts') and with lighter drinking ('protective contexts'). The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42018089500).
   Results
   We screened 1902 retrieved records and identified a final sample of 65 eligible studies. Daily mood, day of week, location and drinking group characteristics are important drivers of whether an individual engages in a heavy drinking occasion. The direction and magnitude of some associations differed by gender, age, personality and motives, such that in particular social or physical contexts, some people may feel compelled to drink more while others are compelled to drink less. Very few sequences of factors were reported as being associated with event-level alcohol consumption.
   Conclusions
   Contexts or factors are experienced in specific sequences that shape the broader drinking context and influence drinking behaviours and consequences but are under-studied. Event-level studies such as those using ecological momentary assessment can harness new technologies for data collection and analysis to improve understandings of why people engage in heavy drinking. Continued event-level research will facilitate public health interventions and policies that reduce heavy drinking and alcohol-related harms.

TI A fully automated sample-to-answer PCR system for easy and sensitive
   detection of dengue virus in human serum and mosquitos
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION-PCR; TIME RT-PCR; AEDES-AEGYPTI;
   HEMORRHAGIC-FEVER; RAPID DETECTION; ASSAY; MULTIPLEX; DIAGNOSIS
AB Background
   The insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) technology enables consistent PCR amplification and detection in a simple heating device. A pan-dengue virus (DENV) RT-iiPCR, targeting the 5 untranslated region, was validated previously on the semi-automated POCKIT combo system (involving separate devices for nucleic acid extraction and PCR amplification/detection) to offer performance comparable to a laboratory real-time PCR. Working on the same technologies, a compact automated sample-in-answer-out system (POCKIT Central Nucleic Acid Analyser) has been available commercially for iiPCR, minimizing human error risks and allowing easy molecular bio-detection near points of need. Here, we evaluated the analytical and clinical performance of the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR on the fully automated system by comparison to those on the semi-automated system.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   Testing sera containing serial diluted DENV-1, -2, -3, or -4 cell culture stock, the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR system had similar 100% detection endpoints on the two systems; i.e. at 1, 10, 1 and 10 PFU/ml, respectively, on the fully automated system, and at 10, 1, 10 and 10 PFU/ml, respectively, on the semi-automated system. Furthermore, both fully automated and semi-automated PCR system can detect all four DENV serotypes in mosquitos. Clinical performance of the reagent on the two systems was evaluated by testing 60 human serum samples. Both systems detected the same 40 samples (ten DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4 positive each) and did not detect the other 20; 100% agreement (kappa = 1) was found between the two systems.
   Conclusions/Significance
   With performance comparable to a previously validated system, the fully-automated PCR system allows applications of the pan-DENV reagent as a useful tool near points of need to facilitate easy, fast and effective detection of dengue virus and help mitigate versatile public health challenges in the control and management of dengue disease.

AB Background
   Residential density was found to be associated with excess body weight among adults in Western societies but it remains unclear in China. We aimed to explore the relationship between residential density and excess body weight among adults in China.
   Methods
   This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2017 in urban areas of Nanjing, China. A multi-stage sampling method was used to randomly select participants aged 35-74 years from 8 urban neighborhoods in Nanjing. Status of excess body weight was the outcome variable which was categorized as "yes (BMI >= 24)" or "no (BMI<24)" according to specific recommendations for Chinese adults. Residential density was the main explanatory variable which was grouped into tertiles. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CIs) were calculated to assess the relationship between residential density and excess body weight using mixed-effects regression models after adjusting for age, sex, education, occupation, marital status, redmeat, smoking, physical activity, diabetic status and potential neighborhood-level clustering effect.
   Results
   A total of 1551 participants were recruited with a response rate of 98.9% (1551/1568). The mean age (standard deviation) of participants was 54.7 (11.1) years, and 46% of them were men. With adjustment for potential influential factors, participants in neighborhoods with lower (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.06-1.81) and middle (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.64) tertile of residential density were at significantly higher risk of gaining excess body weight relative to their counterparts in communities with upper tertile of residential density. Such a negative association between residential density and excess body weight was observed for men only after stratified analysis by gender.
   Conclusions
   A negative association between residential density and excess body weight was identified in overall and male urban Chinese adults, and the association was independent of physical activity. Results of our study have important implications in guiding public health policy making regarding prevention of excess body weight at community level via establishment of health-friendly neighborhood environment in China.

AB Background: There is growing awareness of the need for effective prevention, early detection, and novel treatment approaches for common mental disorders (CMDs) among university students. Reliable epidemiological data on prevalence and correlates are the cornerstones of planning and implementing effective health services and adopting a public health approach to student wellness. Yet, there is a comparative lack of sound psychiatric epidemiological studies on CMDs among university students in low-and middle-income countries, like South Africa (SA). It is also unclear if historically marginalised groups of students are at increased risk for mental health problems in post-apartheid SA. The objective of the study was to investigate the prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of lifetime and 12-month CMDs among university students in SA, with a particular focus on vulnerability among students in historically excluded and marginalised segments of the population.
   Methods: Data were collected via self-report measures in an online survey of first-year students registered at two large universities (n = 1402). CMDs were assessed with previously-validated screening scales. Data were weighted and analysed using multivariate statistical methods.
   Results: A total of 38.5% of respondents reported at least one lifetime CMD, the most common being major depressive disorder (24.7%). Twelve-month prevalence of any CMD was 31.5%, with generalised anxiety disorder being the most common (20.8%). The median age of onset for any disorder was 15 years. The median proportional annual persistence of any disorder was 80.0%. Female students, students who reported an atypical sexual orientation, and students with disabilities were at significantly higher risk of any lifetime or 12-month disorder. Female gender, atypical sexual orientation, and disability were associated with elevated risk of internalising disorders, whereas male gender, identifying as White, and reporting an atypical sexual orientation were associated with elevated risk of externalising disorders. Older age, atypical sexual orientation, and disability were associated with elevated risk of bipolar spectrum disorder.
   Conclusions: Despite advances to promote greater social inclusion in post-apartheid SA, students who identify as female, students with atypical sexual orientations, and students with disabilities are nonetheless at increased risk of CMDs, although students who identify as Black and first-generation students are not.

SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES

DE Intestinal parasitic infection; Prevalence; Survey; Clonorchis sinensis;
   Jiangsu province; Eastern China
ID DIAGNOSIS
AB Background: Intestinal helminth infections are a serious public health problem in developing countries. Jiangsu, an eastern coastal province of China, has an environment conducive to the transmission of intestinal parasites, and suffered human infection rates of 71.75% in 1990. Due to comprehensive anti-transmission measures undertaken throughout the province in the 1990s, the prevalence had decreased to 9.28% in 2002. In order to assess the current epidemic situation for intestinal parasitic infections in Jiangsu province, a province-wide cross-sectional survey was carried out in 2015.
   Methods: Surveys were conducted in two main settings; rural (for soil-transmitted parasites) and urban (for Clonorchis sinensis), selected through stratified random sampling. Human infection rates were evaluated through the detection of helminth eggs or cysts (oocysts or trophozoites) of intestinal protozoa in fecal samples by microscopy. Secondary intermediate and reservoir hosts were surveyed for C. sinensis infection. Questionnaires were completed by each participant to evaluate knowledge, attitude and practice of soil-transmitted parasite and C. sinensis avoidance.
   Results: 115 out of 30153 participants (0.38%) had intestinal helminths or protozoa. There were eight species of helminth detected and the most common parasite was the hookworm Ancylostoma duodenale. In rural settings, there were significant differences in infection rates between participants of differing economic status. In urban settings, only four cases of C. sinensis infection were detected. However, secondary intermediate and reservoir hosts were found to harbor parasites. The questionnaire survey revealed that 38.42% participants were not aware of how humans become infected by hookworms. Knowledge and awareness of C. sinensis was similarly low, with 53.22% participants combining the use of chopping boards for raw and cooked food items when preparing meals.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in Jiangsu Province in eastern China has decreased from 71.57% in 1990 to 0.38% in 2015. Control measures should now focus on parasitic infections in the elderly and in children, health promotion and the development of alternative detection methods.

   report; Guinea; Liberia; West Africa
AB Background: Infectious disease prevention and control strategies require a coordinated, transnational approach. To establish core capacities of the International Health Regulations (IHR), the World Health Organization (WHO) developed the Integrated Diseases Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy. Epidemic-prone Lassa fever, caused by Lassa virus, is an endemic disease in the West African countries of Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Benin, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Togo and Nigeria. It's one of the major public health threats in these countries. Here it is reported an epidemiological investigation of a cross-border case of Lassa fever, which demonstrated the importance of strengthened capacities of IHR and IDSR.
   Case presentation: On January 9th, 2018 a 35-year-old Guinean woman with fever, neck pain, body pain, and vomiting went to a hospital in Ganta, Liberia. Over the course of her illness, the case visited various health care facilities in both Liberia and Guinea. A sample collected on January 10th was tested positive for Lassa virus by RT-PCR in a Liberian laboratory. The Guinean Ministry of Health (MoH) was officially informed by WHO Country Office for Guinea and for Liberia.
   Conclusion: This case report revealed how an epidemic-prone disease such as Lassa fever can rapidly spread across land borders and how such threat can be quickly controlled with communication and collaboration within the IHR framework.

ID PREEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS
AB Background: Despite effective antiretroviral therapy developed over the last decade, HIV infection remains a major worldwide public health problem. Recently, a promising preventive treatment has been made available for HIV prophylaxis, PrEP for pre-ExPosure Prophylaxis. Indeed, it was shown to significantly reduce the risk of HIV infection in patients exposed to high risk of infection such as men having sex with men (MSM), heterosexuals and people who inject drugs. Several issues pertaining to PrEP remain uncertain including short and long-term adverse events, drug resistance, risk compensation and resurgence of other sexually transmitted infections.
   Case presentation: We report a case of a 52-year-old MSM eligible for PrEP as he was exposed to a high risk of HIV infection, presented no clinical symptoms of HIV primary infection and was seronegative for HIV. PrEP therapy was then initiated with fixed association of emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil. One month later, HIV tests using two different assays were positive, despite perfect compliance reported by the patient and confirmed by plasma drug level. A retrospective search for plasma viral RNA in the blood sample before PrEP initiation turned out positive. Genotyping and treatment sensitivity performed on sample after one month of PrEP showed a virus resistance to lamivudine and emtricitabine.
   Similar cases in the literature and pivotal studies have reported HIV infections in patients initiating or undergoing PrEP. These patients where either infected but still seronegative, displaying no clinical symptoms upon enrollment, or became infected during PrEP. Reasons are mainly poor compliance to treatment, resistance to PrEP, and lack of diagnosis before PrEP. Guidelines advocate safe sex behavior before initiation, search for clinical signs of HIV primary infection and two different serologic tests performed with one-month interval.
   Discussion and conclusions: Our patient newly HIV infected received PrEP as he was still seronegative. Current recommendations fail to screen recently HIV infected, but still seronegative patients who are initiating PrEP. This issue raises strong concerns regarding the lack of adequate selection for eligibility to PrEP and may contribute to exposing partners to HIV infection and select viral mutations. Infection risk could be minimized by search for plasma viral HIV RNA at pre-inclusion, at least for patients suspected of unsafe behaviors such as non-respect of the non-exposure period before PrEP initiation.

AB This study examined profiles of participation in extracurricular activities (ECAs) in 4(th) grade children (N = 27,121; Mean age = 9.20 years; SD = .54; 51% male) in British Columbia, Canada. Latent class analyses were used to establish activity profiles and determine class membership; ANCOVA was used to investigate differences in mental wellbeing (optimism, life satisfaction, self-concept) and perceived overall health between groups. Data came from a cross-sectional, population-level child self-report survey (i.e., the Middle Years Development Instrument) implemented with 4(th) grade children in public schools. We found four distinct ECA profiles: participation in All Activities, No activities, Sports (i.e., individual and team sports), and Individual activities (i.e., educational programs, arts/music, individual sports). Wellbeing and health scores were highest for children in the All Activities and the Sports clusters, and lowest for those in No Activities and the cluster reflecting individual activities (i.e., Individual activities). Results are discussed in the context of previous research, and with respect to practical relevance.

AB Background
   Since 2006 there has been substantial long-term investment in school-based child obesity prevention programs in New South Wales (Australia). Whether these programs have led to population level improvements in children's weight status and weight-related behaviors are yet to be determined. The purpose of this study was to describe changes in children's weight status and weight-related behaviors, including Indigenous children, who are at greater risk of poorer health outcomes than non-Indigenous children.
   Methods
   Representative cross-sectional population surveys conducted in 2010 and 2015 among children age 5-16 years (n = 15,613). Objective measurements included height, weight, waist circumference, cardiorespiratory fitness, and fundamental movement skills. Indigenous status and indicators of weight-related behavior (i.e., diet, physical activity, school travel, screen-time) were measured by questionnaire with parents responding for children age <10 years and self-report by children age >= 10 years.
   Results
   The prevalences of overweight/obesity, obesity and abdominal obesity were higher in 2015, than 2010, and higher among Indigenous than non-Indigenous children at both timepoints. There were some small positive changes towards healthier weight-related behaviors between surveys among all children, but many unhealthy weight-related behaviors remain highly prevalent. The magnitude of changes and the 2015 prevalences of weight-related behaviors were generally similar for Indigenous and non-Indigenous children.
   Conclusions
   Schools play an important role in health promotion, but our findings suggest the current approaches need re-thinking. Upstream factors that shape weight-related behaviors such as the regulation of the food industry and food environment, urban, neighborhood and public transport planning must be including in solutions to ensure populations can eat healthily and be physical active.

AB BackgroundADHD affects some individuals throughout their lifespan, yet service provision for adults in the United Kingdom (UK) is patchy. Current methods for mapping health service provision are resource intensive, do not map specialist ADHD teams separately from generic mental health services, and often fail to triangulate government data with accounts from service users and clinicians. Without a national audit that maps adult ADHD provision, it is difficult to quantify current gaps in provision and make the case for change. This paper describes the development of a seven step approach to map adult ADHD service provision in the UK.MethodsA mapping method was piloted in 2016 and run definitively in 2018. A seven step method was developed: 1. Defining the target service 2. Identifying key informants 3. Designing the survey 4. Data collection 5. Data analysis 6. Communicating findings 7. Hosting/updating the service map. Patients and members of the public (including clinicians and commissioners) were involved with design, data collection and dissemination of findings.ResultsUsing a broad definition of adult ADHD services resulted in an inclusive list of identified services, and allowed the definition to be narrowed to National Health Service (NHS) funded specialist ADHD services at data analysis, with confidence that few relevant services would be missed. Key informants included patients, carers, a range of health workers, and commissioners. A brief online survey, written using lay terms, appeared acceptable to informants. Emails sent using national organisations' mailing lists were the most effective way to access informants on a large scale. Adaptations to the methodology in 2018 were associated with 64% more responses (2371 vs 1446) collected in 83% less time (5 vs 30weeks) than the pilot. The 2016 map of adult ADHD services was viewed 13,688 times in 17weeks, indicating effective communication of findings.ConclusionThis seven step pragmatic method was effective for collating and communicating national service data about UK adult ADHD service provision. Patient and public involvement and engagement from partner organisations was crucial throughout. Lessons learned may be transferable to mapping service provision for other health conditions and in other locations.

AB BackgroundMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and has resultant important economic and societal costs underscoring the need for accurate surveillance. In recent years, prevalence rates reported in East Africa have been inconsistent, sparking controversy and raising concern.MethodsWe described antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Staphylococcus aureus isolates cultured from patients within the Internal Medicine department of the largest public healthcare facility in East and Central Africa- the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) in Nairobi, Kenya. Routine antimicrobial susceptibility data from non-duplicate Staphylococcus aureus isolates cultured between the years 2014-2016 from the medical wards in KNH were reviewed.ResultsAntimicrobial susceptibility data from a total of 187 Staphylococcus aureus isolates revealed an overall MRSA prevalence of 53.4%. Isolates remained highly susceptible to linezolid, tigecycline, teicoplanin and vancomycin.ConclusionsThe prevalence of MRSA was found to be much higher than that reported in private tertiary facilities in the same region. Careful interrogation of antimicrobial susceptibility results is important to uproot any red herrings and reserve genuine cause for alarm, as this has a critical bearing on health and economic outcomes for a population.

AB BackgroundNeonatal bloodspot screening (NBS) identifies conditions to offer early intervention and minimize irreversible damage. NBS policies guide a comprehensive system including processes for storage of neonatal dried blood spots (NDBS). NDBS retention and secondary use policies have been subject of public debates internationally, suggesting that the public's perceptions of NDBS policy are not always on par with existing policies. The current study aims to provide insight in relevant factors for new parents in the Netherlands regarding retention and secondary use of NDBS. These factors can be taken into account when developing or updating NDBS policies.MethodsA mixed methods design was used combining an online survey (n=753), focus groups (6 groups, 37 participants), and individual in-depth interviews (n=7). The discussed topics included: parental information, obtaining informed consent, support for retention, and support forsecondary use. The study population consisted of Dutch-speaking new parents: pregnant women (>= 20weeks) and/or their partner, and parents of at least one child (<= 5years).ResultsNew parents expressed needs for easily accessible information, adequate communication on the retention and (potential) use of NDBS, clearly described safeguards for privacy, a more active consent process, regulation for the actors conducting NDBS research, and parental involvement in decisions on secondary use. Overall, participants were positive about prolonged retention and different types of secondary use if those needs were met.ConclusionsWhile parental involvement is a challenge, our study is an example of gauging parent's perspectives on NDBS policy and contributes to including these perspectives in the current policy discussion on longer retention. Prolonged retention could be a feasible option in the Netherlands if several prerequisites are met. Therefore, implementation studies involving parents are needed.

AB Background: Annual seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) is recommended for people with diabetes, but their SIV rates remain far below public health targets. We aimed to identify temporal trajectories of SIV uptake over a 10-year period among French people with diabetes and describe their clinical characteristics.
   Methods: We identified patients with diabetes in 2006 among a permanent, representative sample of beneficiaries of the French National Health Insurance Fund. We followed them up over 10 seasons (2005/06-2015/16), using SIV reimbursement claims and group-based trajectory modelling to identify SIV trajectories and to study sociodemographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization characteristics associated with the trajectories.
   Results We identified six trajectories. Of the 15,766 patients included in the model, 4344 (28%) belonged to the "continuously vaccinated" trajectory and 4728 (30%) to the "never vaccinated" one. Two other trajectories showed a "progressive decrease" (2832, 18%) or sharp "postpandemic decrease" (1627, 10%) in uptake. The last two trajectories (totalling 2235 patients, 14%) showed an early or delayed "increase" in uptake. Compared to "continuously vaccinated" patients, those in the "progressively decreasing" trajectory were older and those in all other trajectories were younger with fewer comorbidities at inclusion. Worsening diabetes and comorbidities during follow-up were associated with the "increasing" trajectories.
   Conclusions Most patients with diabetes had been continuously vaccinated or never vaccinated and thus had stable SIV behaviours. Others adopted or abandoned SIV. These behaviour shifts might be due to increasing age, health events, or contextual factors (e.g., controversies about vaccine safety or efficacy). Healthcare professionals and stakeholders should develop tailored strategies that take each group's specificities into account.

AB Background: Taxes on sugary beverages are an emerging strategy to improve health by reducing consumption and raising revenues to support community wellbeing. However, taxes may have unintended consequences, and perceptions of these consequences may affect attitudes towards this policy.
   Methods: In June 2017, the Seattle City Council passed an ordinance imposing a tax on sugary beverages, effective January 1, 2018. Between October and December 2017, we recruited 851 adults in Seattle to complete a survey (telephone or online) about support for the tax and their perceptions of tax-related health and economic impacts. We first analyzed data for the full sample. We then tested for differences in participants' responses by household income level (< 260% Federal Poverty Level [FPL], >= 260% FPL) and across race/ethnicities using chi-square tests. Analyses used population weights and adjusted for multiple comparisons, using the Holm-Bonferroni Sequential Correction (p<0.01).
   Results: A majority of participants supported the sugary beverage tax (59%; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 55, 63%) and believed that the tax would improve public health (56%; CI: 52, 60%). Most participants believed that the tax would not negatively affect small businesses (52%; CI: 48, 56%) nor result in job loss (66%; CI: 62, 70%). Most participants also perceived that the tax would not negatively impact their own finances (79%; CI: 75, 82%). However, fewer lower-income (48%; CI: 42, 53%), versus higher-income participants (61%; CI: 55, 66%), perceived that the tax would improve public health, would not result in job loss (lower-income: 58%; CI: 53, 64%; higher-income: 71%; CI: 66, 75%) and would not negatively affect their own finances (lower-income: 68%; CI: 62, 73%; higher-income: 85%; CI: 81, 88%). Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, (82%; CI: 79, 86%), a smaller proportion of non-Hispanic Blacks (63%; 95% CI: 48, 75%), and Hispanics (67%; 95% CI: 51, 79%), perceived that the tax would have negative consequences for their own family finances.
   Conclusions: A majority of respondents supported the sugary beverage tax in Seattle. Lower-income participants were more concerned about potential financial consequences. Further evaluation of the extent to which unintended consequences occur is needed.

AB Background: Neighbourhood safety has repeatedly been shown to be associated with the health and well-being of the residents. Criminality is often seen as one of the key factors affecting neighbourhood safety. However, the relationship between crime, fear of crime and feelings of safety remains underexplored.
   Methods: Data on socio-demographic, health and safety perceptions was extracted from the Maastricht municipality survey (the Netherlands) (n=9656 adults) and merged with data on official neighbourhood crime rates from the Police Registry. Pearson correlation coefficients and multilevel logistic regression models were computed to assess the association between aspects of objective and perceived criminality, individuals' feelings of safety and health.
   Results: The correlation between the police recorded crime and residents' perceptions of the neighbourhood crime rates was weak (0.14-0.38), with the exception of violent crime (0.59), which indicates that other factors contribute to the perceptions of safety. In turn, the perception of higher rates of violent crime and more nuisance (on the scale 0-10) but not other types of crime or nuisance was positively associated with feeling unsafe (OR 1.27 [1.22;1.32] and 1.39 [1.33;1.46], respectively). Lower general feelings of safety at both the individual and neighbourhood level were consistently associated with worse self-rated health. Among different indicators of safety, the general feelings of safety had the most pronounced association with health, while subjective or objective measures of crime showed limited to no direct relationship with health.
   Conclusions: Public health policies targeting safety as a social determinant of health should consider prioritizing areas of violent crime and nuisance to improve general feelings of safety. Further research is needed to understand which factors aside from criminality are driving residents' feelings of safety.

TI Rapid detection of Burkholderia pseudomallei with a lateral flow
   recombinase polymerase amplification assay
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MELIOIDOSIS; DIAGNOSIS; HAINAN
AB Melioidosis is a severe infectious disease caused by gram-negative, facultative intracellular pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei (B. pseudomallei). Although cases are increasing reported from other parts of the world, it is an illness of tropical and subtropical climates primarily found in southeast Asia and northern Australia. Because of a 40% mortality rate, this life-threatening disease poses a public health risk in endemic area. Early detection of B. pseudomallei infection is vital for prognosis of a melioidosis patient. In this study, a novel isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification combined with lateral flow dipstick (LF-RPA) assay was established for rapid detection of B. pseudomallei. A set of primer-probe targeting orf2 gene within the putative type III secretion system (T3SS) cluster genes was generated and parameters for the LF-RPA assay were optimized. Result can be easy visualized in 30 minutes with the limit of detection (LOD) as low as 20 femtogram (fg) (ca. 25.6 copies) of B. pseudomallei genomic DNA without a specific equipment. The assay is highly specific as no cross amplification was observed with Burkholderia mallei, members of the Burkholderia cepacia-complex and 35 non-B. pseudomallei bacteria species. Moreover, isolates from patients in Hainan (N = 19), Guangdong (N = 1), Guangxi (N = 3) province of China as well as in Australia (N = 3) and Thailand (N = 1) were retrospectively confirmed by the newly developed method. LODs for B. pseudomallei-spiked soil and blood samples were 2.1 x 10(3) CFU/g and 4.2x10(3) CFU/ml respectively. The sensitivity of the LF-RPA assay was comparable to TaqMan Real-Time PCR (TaqMan PCR). In addition, the LF-RPA assay exhibited a better tolerance to inhibitors in blood than TaqMan PCR. Our results showed that the LF-RPA assay is an alternative to existing PCR-based methods for detection of B. pseudomallei with a potentiality of early accurate diagnosis of melioidosis at point of care or in-field use.

TI What causes the burden of stroke in Scotland? A comparative risk
   assessment approach linking the Scottish Health Survey to administrative
   health data

AB Background
   The availability of robust evidence to inform effective public health decision making is becoming increasingly important, particularly in a time of competing health demands and limited resources. Comparative Risk Assessments (CRA) are useful in this regard as they quantify the contribution of modifiable exposures to the disease burden in a population. The aim of this study is to assess the contribution of a range of modifiable exposures to the burden of disease due to stroke, an important public health problem in Scotland.
   Methods
   We used individual-level response data from eight waves (1995-2012) of the Scottish Health Survey linked to acute hospital discharge records from the Scottish Morbidity Record 01 (SMR01) and cause of death records from the death register. Stroke was defined using the International Classification of Disease (ICD) 9 codes 430-431, 433-4 and 436; and the ICD10 codes 160-61 and 163-64 and stroke incidence was defined as a composite of an individual's first hospitalisation or death from stroke. A literature review identified exposures causally linked to stroke. Exposures were mapped to the layers of the Dahlgren & Whitehead model of the determinants of health and Population Attributable Fractions were calculated for each exposure deemed a significant causal risk of stroke from a Cox Proportional Hazards Regression model. Population Attributable Fractions were not summed as they may add to more than 100% due to the possibility of a person being exposed to more than one exposure simultaneously.
   Results
   Overall, the results suggest that socioeconomic factors explain the largest proportion of incident stroke hospitalisations and deaths, after adjustment for confounding. After DAG adjustment, low education explained 38.8% (95% Confidence Interval 26.0% to 49.4%, area deprivation (as measured by the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation) 34.9% (95% CI 26.4 to 42.4%), occupational social class differences 30.3% (95% CI 19.4% to 39.8%), high systolic blood pressure 29.6% (95% CI 20.6% to 37.6%), smoking 25.6% (95% CI 17.9% to 32.6%) and area deprivation (as measured by the Carstairs area deprivation Index) 23.5% (95% CI 14.4% to 31.7%), of incident strokes in Scotland after adjustment.
   Conclusion
   This study provides evidence for prioritising interventions that tackle socioeconomic inequalities as a means of achieving the greatest reduction in avoidable strokes in Scotland. Future work to disentangle the proportion of the effect of deprivation transmitted through intermediate mediators on the pathway between socioeconomic inequalities and stroke may offer additional opportunities to reduce the incidence of stroke in Scotland.

AB Background
   Dengue is a public health problem, and noncompliance with World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for blood transfusion components is frequently reported. Moreover, economic impact studies of the WHO recommendations on the use of blood transfusion are scarce.
   Methods
   We compared the cost and hospitalization time in a prospective observational study, by following hospitalised patients and analysing their medical records from 2010 and March 2016 to December 2017. We divided the patients into two groups: transfused (with or without WHO criteria for transfusion) and not transfused (with or without WHO criteria for transfusion). Generalised linear modelling was performed to identify the variable that could increase the costs and hospital stay.
   Results
   Among 323 patients, 52 were transfused, of whom 52% without criteria (n = 27), and 271 were not transfused, of which 4.4% (n = 12) with criteria. Hospitalisation costs were 41% higher in the transfused group without criteria than in those with criteria (median US$674.3 vs US$478 p = 0.293). Patients who were not transfused but met the WHO criteria for transfusion (n = 12) had longer mean hospitalisation time than did those who were not transfused (3.8 +/- 3.4 days versus 3.6 +/- 3.1 days; p = 0.022). The GLM analysis using hospital stay and costs as the dependent variable explained approximately 33.4% (R-2 = 0.334) of the hospitalisation time and 79.3% (R-2 = 0.793) of costs. Receiving a transfusion increased the hospitalization time by 1.29 days (p = 0.0007; IRR = 1.29), and the costs were 5.1 times higher than those without receiving blood components (IRR = 5.1; p<0.001; median US$ 504.4 vs US$ 170.7). In contrast, patients who were transfused according to WHO criteria had a reduction in costs of approximately 96% (IRR = 0.044; p<0.001; beta = -3.12) compared to that for those who were not transfused according to WHO criteria (without criteria).
   Conclusion
   Transfusion without following WHO recommendations increased the time and cost of hospitalisation.

AB BackgroundDespite continued investment, Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (MNCH) indicators in low and middle income countries have remained relatively poor. This could, in part, be explained by inadequate resources to adequately address these problems, inappropriate allocation of the available resources, or lack of implementation of the most effective interventions. Systematic priority setting and resource allocation could contribute to alleviating these limitations. There is a paucity of literature that follows through MNCH prioritization processes to implementation, making it difficult for policy makers to understand the impact of their decision-making on population health. The overall objective of this paper was to describe and evaluate priority setting for maternal, newborn and child health interventions in Uganda.MethodsFifty-four key informant interviews and a review of policies and media reports were used to describe priority setting for MNCH in Uganda. Kapiriri and Martin's conceptual framework was used to evaluate priority setting for MNCH.ResultsThere were three main prioritization exercises for maternal, newborn and child health in Uganda. The processes were participatory and were guided by explicit tools, evidence, and criteria, however, the public and the districts were insufficiently involved in the priority setting process. While there were conducive contextual factors including strong political support, implementation was constrained by the presence of competing actors, with varying priorities, an unequal allocation of resources between child health and maternal health interventions, limited financial and human resources, a weak health system and limited institutional capacity.ConclusionsStronger institutional capacity at the Ministry of Health and equitable engagement of key stakeholders in decision-making processes, especially the public, and implementers, would improve understanding, satisfaction and compliance with the priority setting process. Availability of financial and human resources that are appropriately allocated would facilitate the implementation of well-developed policies.

AB BackgroundAlzheimer's disease has become a public health crisis globally due to its increasing incidence. The purpose of this study was to establish an early warning model using artificial neural network (ANN) for early diagnosis of AD and to explore early sensitive markers for AD.MethodsA population based nested case-control study design was used. 89 new AD cases with good compliance who were willing to provide urine and blood specimen were selected from the cohort of 2482 community-dwelling elderly aged 60years and over from 2013 to 2016. For each case, two controls living nearby were identified. Biomarkers for AD in urine and blood, neuropsychological functions and epidemiological parameters were included to analyze potential risk factors of AD. Compared with logistic regression, k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and support vector machine (SVM) model, back-propagation neural network of three-layer topology structures was applied to develop the early warning model. The performance of all models were measured by sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive prognostic value (PPV), negative prognostic value (NPV), the area under curve (AUC), and were validated using bootstrap resampling.ResultsThe average age of AD group was about 5years older than the non-AD controls (P<0.001). Patients with AD included a significantly larger proportion of subjects with family history of dementia, compared with non-AD group. After adjusting for age and gender, the concentrations of urinary AD7c-NTP and aluminum in blood were significantly higher in AD group than non-AD group (2.011.06 vs 1.03 +/- 0.43, 1.74 +/- 0.62 vs 1.24 +/- 0.41 respectively), but the concentration of Selenium in AD group (2.26 +/- 0.59) was significantly lower than that in non-AD group (2.61 +/- 1.07). All the models were established using 18 variables that were significantly different between AD patients and controls as independent variables. The ANN model outperformed the other classifiers. The AUC for this ANN was 0.897 and the model obtained the accuracy of 92.13%, the sensitivity of 87.28% and the specificity of 94.74% on the average.Conclusions Increased risk of AD may be associated with higher age among senior citizens in urban communities. Urinary AD7c-NTP is clinically valuable for the early diagnosis. The established ANN model obtained a high accuracy and diagnostic efficiency, which could be a low-cost practicable tool for the screening and diagnosis of AD for citizens.

AB BackgroundOn an absolute basis, Argentina is the country with the largest affected population with Chagas Disease (ChD). This constitutes a significant public health issue. As a consequence of Argentina's migratory patterns, there has been a significant increase of affected population in urban centers. An innovative project for early diagnosis and timely treatment of ChD was designed for Municipal Primary Care Facilities of La Plata City, a non- endemic area, in line with a proposal from the Pan-American Health Organization. The project was a public -private intervention. The objectives of this study were to demonstrate the feasibility of the primary healthcare level for early diagnosis and timely treatment of ChD; to design and implement a tailor made program and to innovate in a public-private association.MethodsThe healthcare barriers for early diagnosis and timely treatment for the population with ChD of La Plata were analyzed. The four dimensions described by Peters et al. (Ann N Y Acad Sci 1136:161-71, 2008) were used. The baseline was measured during a previous pilot project and the same items were evaluated at the end of 2017. The model from Damschroder et al. (Implement Sci 4:50, 2009) was used during the implementation process.ResultsWith all the information gathered during this investigation, a patient-centered model was designed. During the program, 17,894 people were serologically tested for ChD, 1,394 were positive and 1,035 were treated. Additionally, 3,750 children from 46 public schools were evaluated for risk factors of ChD.ConclusionsThis project showed the feasibility of the primary healthcare level for early diagnosis and timely treatment of ChD. Tailor made programs and public-private associations should be considered for vulnerable populations in emerging economies in order to enhance efforts and obtain better results. This program may be replicated in other countries of Latin America were Chagas is a main public health issue and, with the corresponding adaptations, for other neglected diseases as well.

AB BackgroundSmall island Caribbean countries such as Jamaica are now facing an epidemic of obesity and decreased physical activity (PA) levels. Public parks have been shown to be important resources for PA that also provide psychological and social benefits associated with increased PA. There are no studies that document PA in parks in the Caribbean.MethodsThis study utilized a mixed method approach by using the System for Observing Play and Recreation in Communities (SOPARC) to obtain baseline data on park usage patterns in Emancipation Park, a large urban public park in Jamaica. In addition, in-depth interviews were conducted to gain additional insights on the park's use for PA.ResultsThe park was used mostly by females, in the evenings and by persons 18-64years old. Females had significantly lower mean energy expenditure (EE) than males (0.078 versus 0.080kcal/kg/min, p<0.05). In-depth interviews revealed that safety, a central location within a business district, aesthetic appeal, a walking track and individual health benefits were key reasons for persons engaging in PA at the park.ConclusionsThis is the first study to describe the usage of a public park for PA in Jamaica. The study elicited aspects of park use for PA in a major urban park in Jamaica from different vantage points by using direct systematic observation augmented with a qualitative approach. It revealed important differential park use for PA by sex, age group and EE levels, and provided insights into factors that motivate and hinder park usage for PA. This can be used by policymakers in Jamaica to inform PA interventions to reduce obesity, provide baseline data for comparisons with other parks in developing countries and to advocate for well-designed public parks.

AB BackgroundRegular physical activity improves overall health, and has the capacity to reduce risk of chronic diseases and death. However, better understanding of the relationship between multiple lifestyle risk behaviours and disease outcomes is pertinent for prioritising public health messaging. The aim of this systematic review is to examine the association between physical inactivity in combination with additional lifestyle risk behaviours (smoking, alcohol, diet, or sedentary behaviour) for cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all-cause mortality.MethodsWe searched Ovid Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Register from 1 January 2010 to 12 December 2017, for longitudinal observational studies of adults (18+ years) in the general population with a publication date of 2010 onwards and no language restriction. Main exposure variables had to include a physical activity measure plus at least one other lifestyle risk factor. In total, 25,639 studies were identified. Titles, abstracts and full-text articles of potentially relevant papers were screened for eligibility. Data was extracted and quality assessment was completed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).ResultsAcross the 25 eligible studies, those participants who reported being physically active combined with achieving other health behaviour goals compared to those who were categorised as physically inactive and did not achieve other positive lifestyle goals, were at least half as likely to experience an incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) event, die from CVD, or die from any cause. These findings were consistent across participant age, sex, and study length of follow-up, and even after excluding lower quality studies. We also observed a similar trend among the few studies which were restricted to cancer outcomes. Most studies did not consider epidemiological challenges that may bias findings, such as residual confounding, reverse causality by pre-existing disease, and measurement error from self-report data.ConclusionsHigh levels of physical activity in combination with other positive lifestyle choices is associated with better health outcomes. Applying new approaches to studying the complex relationships between multiple behavioural risk factors, including physical activity, should be a priority.

TI Gender-based violence and engagement in biomedical HIV prevention, care

AB BackgroundWhile gender-based violence (GBV) has been shown to increase women's risk of HIV acquisition, the role of GBV in the HIV testing to care continuum is less clear. Clarifying how GBV may act as a barrier to accessing HIV services, treatment and care - such as anti-retroviral treatment (ART) or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) - will not only provide insights into how to best meet individual women's HIV care needs, but also inform public health oriented HIV epidemic control strategies.MethodsThrough a comprehensive scoping review, we synthesized and analyzed existing evidence regarding the influence of GBV on engagement in PrEP and the HIV care continuum among women living with HIV, including members of key populations (female sex workers, transgender women and women who use drugs). We explored PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science for peer-reviewed studies published in 2003-2017. Of the 279 sources identified, a subset of 51 sources met the criteria and were included in the scoping review.ResultsStudies were identified from 17 countries. The majority of studies utilized quantitative cross-sectional designs (n=33), with the rest using longitudinal (n=4), qualitative (n=10) or mixed methods (n=4) designs. Taken together, findings suggest that GBV impedes women's uptake of HIV testing, care, and treatment, yet this can vary across different geographic and epidemic settings. Substantial gaps in the literature do still exist, including studies on the impact of GBV on engagement in PrEP, and research among key populations.ConclusionsThis scoping review contributes to our knowledge regarding the role GBV plays in women's engagement in PrEP and the HIV care continuum. Findings reveal the need for more longitudinal research to provide insights into the causal pathways linking GBV and HIV care and treatment outcomes. Research is also needed to illuminate the impact of GBV on PrEP use and adherence as well as the impact of GBV on engagement along the HIV care continuum among key populations. It is critical that programs and research keep pace with these findings in order to reduce the global burden of GBV and HIV among women.

AB BackgroundPremature birth is a growing and serious public health problem affecting more than one of every ten infants worldwide. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common neonatal morbidity associated with prematurity and infants with BPD suffer from increased incidence of respiratory infections, asthma, other forms of chronic lung illness, and death (Day and Ryan, Pediatr Res 81: 210-213, 2017; Isayama et la., JAMA Pediatr 171:271-279, 2017). BPD is now understood as a longitudinal disease process influenced by the intrauterine environment during gestation and modulated by gene-environment interactions throughout the neonatal and early childhood periods. Despite of this concept, there remains a paucity of multidisciplinary team-based approaches dedicated to the comprehensive study of this complex disease.MethodsThe Discovery BPD (D-BPD) Program involves a cohort of infants <1,250g at birth prospectively followed until 6years of age. The program integrates analysis of detailed clinical data by machine learning, genetic susceptibility and molecular translation studies.DiscussionThe current gap in understanding BPD as a complex multi-trait spectrum of different disease endotypes will be addressed by a bedside-to-bench and bench-to-bedside approach in the D-BPD program. The D-BPD will provide enhanced understanding of mechanisms, evolution and consequences of lung diseases in preterm infants. The D-BPD program represents a unique opportunity to combine the expertise of biologists, neonatologists, pulmonologists, geneticists and biostatisticians to examine the disease process from multiple perspectives with a singular goal of improving outcomes of premature infants.Trial registrationDoes not apply for this study.

AB The increase of multidrug resistance and resistance to last-line antibiotics is a major global public health threat. Although surveillance programs provide useful current and historical information on the scale of the problem, the future emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance is uncertain, and quantifying this uncertainty is crucial for guiding decisions about investment in antibiotics and resistance control strategies. Mathematical and statistical models capable of projecting future rates are challenged by the paucity of data and the complexity of the emergence and spread of resistance, but experts have relevant knowledge. We use the Classical Model of structured expert judgment to elicit projections with uncertainty bounds of resistance rates through 2026 for nine pathogen-antibiotic pairs in four European countries and empirically validate the assessments against data on a set of calibration questions. The performance-weighted combination of experts in France, Spain, and the United Kingdom projected that resistance for five pairs on the World Health Organization's priority pathogens list (E. coli and K. pneumoniae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems and MRSA) would remain below 50% in 2026. In Italy, although upper bounds of 90% credible ranges exceed 50% resistance for some pairs, the medians suggest Italy will sustain or improve its current rates. We compare these expert projections to statistical forecasts based on historical data from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net). Results from the statistical models differ from each other and from the judgmental forecasts in many cases. The judgmental forecasts include information from the experts about the impact of current and future shifts in infection control, antibiotic usage, and other factors that cannot be easily captured in statistical forecasts, demonstrating the potential of structured expert judgment as a tool for better understanding the uncertainty about future antibiotic resistance.

AB Background
   Anemia during childhood adversely affects mental, physical and social development of the children. This study is aimed to assess the prevalence of anemia and its associated factors among children less than five years of age in Guguftu, South Wollo, Northeast Ethiopia.
   Method
   A cross-sectional health facility based study was conducted among 404 children aged 6 to 59 months. Systematic random sampling technique was used to include the participants. Pretested and structured questionnaires were used to collect socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the family and child. Data on nutritional status, capillary blood and stool samples were collected from each child. Multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals.
   Result
   The overall prevalence of anemia was 41.1% (95% CI; 36.6% - 45.8%). Of the anemic under five children, 112 (67.5%) had mild anemia, 52(31.3%) had moderate anemia, and 2(1.2%) had severe anemia. Children who were in the age group of 6-11(AOR = 4.52; 95% CI: 1.67-12.34) and 12-23 (AOR = 2.79; 95% CI: 1.04-7.51) months, living in an urban (AOR = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.05-3.18), with no formal education mothers (AOR = 7.05; 95% CI: 2.93-17.01) and primary education mothers (AOR = 3.26; 95% CI: 1.29-8.24), with a family monthly income of <750 ETB(AOR = 5.19; 95% CI: 1.24-21.75) and 750-1500 ETB(AOR = 5.89; 95% CI: 1.45-23.98), with early (<6 months) introduction of complementary foods (AOR = 3.53; 95% CI: 1.23-10.18), Underweight (AOR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.21-3.69) were more likely to become anemic.
   Conclusion
   This study has revealed that the prevalence of anemia in children less than five years is high and a severe public health problem in the study area. Therefore, the policymakers should make a strategy that can reduce poverty and increase the awareness of women on breast-feeding, nutrition, and other associated factors to reduce anemia.

TI Point-of-care CD4 technology invalid result rates in public health care
   settings across five countries
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   Since 2010, point-of-care (POC) CD4 testing platforms have been introduced in both urban and rural settings to expand access to testing by bringing diagnostic services closer to patients. We conducted an analysis of routinely collected CD4 testing data to determine the invalid result rates associated with POC CD4 testing.
   Methods
   We analyzed 981,152 CD4 testing records collected from Alere Pima Analyzers between January 2011 and December 2016 across five countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Routinely collected data and programmatic records were used to determine the rate of invalid test results per month, by facility type, and by operator based on cumulative usage during the study period. In addition, frequency of invalid test types and utilization of control beads were assessed.
   Results
   Across the five countries, 75,530 invalid messages were returned, resulting in an overall invalid result rate of 7.7%. The invalid result rate by country ranged from 6.6% to 11.2%. Invalid result rates were consistent across facility types. Invalid result rates were inversely correlated with operator usage: low volume operators (<50 tests over study period) experienced an invalid result rate of 10.2%, while high volume operators (>500 tests over study period) experienced an invalid result rate of 5.5%. Two invalid result types (exposure position control and reagent control) accounted for nearly 50% of invalid results. Routine data showed that control beads were run on 88.3% of days that the device was used.
   Conclusions
   Our analysis found that the rate of invalid results was consistent across all types of health facilities, indicating that decentralization of POC CD4 testing to lower level health facilities did not exhibit high invalid result rates or increase cartridge wastage. Additionally, invalid result rates were inversely correlated to operator usage, with high-volume operators experiencing lower invalid result rates than low-volume operators. POC CD4 testing can, therefore, be performed in decentralized national testing programs; however, adequate training, quality assurance, routine monitoring, and ongoing mentorship should also be implemented for success.

Autochthonous human cases of West Nile virus have been reported infrequently since 2004, and since October 2018 three autochthonous human case of dengue fever have been confirmed. In response to an outbreak of any arboviral disease, space spraying or fogging will be implemented to control adult mosquito populations. To ensure adulticiding is cost-effective, the insecticide susceptibility status of vectors throughout Catalonia, an autonomous region in north-eastern Spain, was assessed through standardized WHO tube and CDC bottle bioassays. All Culex pipiens populations tested were resistant to at least one of the pyrethroids tested, whereas Aedes albopictus populations were susceptible to all pyrethroids tested. More detailed studies on the Cx. pipiens populations from the Barcelona area (the capital and largest city of Catalonia) revealed resistance to all four classes of public health insecticides available (pyrethroids, carbamates, organophosphates and organochlorides). All Ae. albopictus populations were susceptible to those classes, except for one of the tests performed with pirimiphos-methyl (an organophosphate). Pyrethroids are currently the first line chemical class to be used in space spray operations in response to an outbreak of an arboviral disease. While pyrethroids can be effective in reducing Ae. albopictus populations, this class may not be effective to control Cx. pipiens populations.

AB Background
   For the estimated 554,000 homeless individuals on any given night in the United States, obtaining quality sleep is often challenging. This group is known to have multiple health disparities, potentially affected by sleep problems; therefore, identifying lifestyle factors-such as physical activity-that are associated with improving both quality and quantity of sleep has important implications for public health. Here, we examine associations of physical activity with subjective sleep problems within a large sample of homeless adults.
   Methods
   Participants were homeless adults recruited from Dallas and Oklahoma (N = 747; 66.1% men, M-age = 43.7 +/- 12.1). Participants self-reported insufficient sleep (number of days without sufficient rest/sleep in the last month; categorized as 0, 1-13, 14-29, or >= 30 days), sleep duration (over average 24 hours; categorized as <= 6 [short sleeper], 7-9 [optimal sleeper], or >= 10 hours [long sleeper]), and unintentional daytime sleep (number of days with unintentional sleep in the last month; categorized as 0 vs >= 30 days). Physical activity was assessed subjectively using the BRFSS Physical Activity Questionnaire. Regression analyses were performed to examine the associations between physical activity and sleep problems, controlling for age, sex, race, education, body mass, months homeless, at-risk drinking, self-rated health, serious mental illness, smoking status, and recruitment city.
   Results
   Failure to meet/exceed physical activity guidelines was associated with higher likelihood of being a long sleeper (OR = 2.64, 95% CI: 1.46, 4.78) but a lower likelihood of having >= 30 days of insufficient rest/sleep (OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.29, 0.93).
   Conclusions
   Findings suggest that physical activity promotion may hold promise for addressing the problem of too much sleep, but not other manifestations of sleep problems among this vulnerable group.

AB BackgroundEvidence supports the fact that multicomponent exercise and HMB supplementation are, separately, effective in improving older adult's health and palliate functional metabolic diseases in older people. However, the true effect of HMB supplementation combined with a tailored exercise program in frail older adults is still unknown. Thus, the aim of the HEAL (HMB+Exercise=Adults Living longer) study is to assess the effects of the combination of a daily multicomponent exercise and resistance training (VIVIFRAIL program) intervention in addition to HMB supplementation on older adults' health.Methods/designA 24-week cluster randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will be conducted on 104 adults >= 70years. Nursing homes will be randomized to either of four groups: Ex-HMB (exercise intervention with HMB), Ex-Plac (exercise intervention with placebo), NoEx-HMB (no exercise intervention with HMB), and Controls (No exercise and no HMB). Intervention groups which include exercise will complete the individualized multicomponent (strength, balance and cardiovascular exercises) training program VIVIFRAIL. Intervention groups which include HMB supplementation will receive a 3g/daily dose of free acid HMB in powder form. The primary outcome measure is the functional capacity. Secondary outcome measures are muscle strength and power, frailty and fall risk, body composition, biochemical analyses and cardiometabolic risk factor, disability and comorbidity, cognitive function and depression.DiscussionThe findings of the HEAL study will help professionals from public health systems to identify cost-effective and innovative actions to improve older people's health and quality of life, and endorse exercise practice in older adults and people living in nursing homes.Trial registrationNCT03827499; Date of registration: 01/02/2019.

AB BackgroundInfluenza vaccination is recognized as a primary public health intervention which prevents the illness of patients and relieves the societal burdens of influenza for medical community as well as the economy. To date, no effectiveness study of influenza vaccination has been conducted including a large population with a wide age span, in Japan. Here, we evaluated the clinical effectiveness of influenza vaccination in a large Japanese population.MethodsWe conducted a cohort study using a large-scale claims database for employee health care insurance plans. Vaccination status was identified using plan records for influenza vaccination subsidies. We excluded people aged 65years or more because of the unavailability of vaccination records. Effectiveness of vaccination in preventing influenza and its complication was evaluated with doubly robust methods using inversed probability treatment weighting to adjust health conscious behaviours and other confounders.ResultsDuring the 2013/2014 influenza season, 369,425 subjects with age range from 1 to 64years were eligible. Vaccination rate was 39.5% and an estimated odds ratio (OR) for influenza onset was 0.775 after doubly robust adjustment. Age-stratified ORs were significantly reduced in all age groups; lowest in subjects aged 1 to 4years (0.600) and highest in those aged 13 to 19 (0.938). ORs for all the influenza complication outcomes were also statistically significant (0.403-0.709).ConclusionsWe confirmed the clinical effectiveness of influenza vaccination in people aged 1 to 64years. Influenza vaccination significantly prevented influenza onset and was more effective in reducing secondary risks of influenza complications.

DE Zika; Non-identity problem; Ethics; Survey; Harm; Person-affecting;

AB BackgroundThe non-identity problem arises when our actions in the present could change which people will exist in the future, for better or worse. Is it morally better to improve the lives of specific future people, as compared to changing which people exist for the better? Affecting the timing of fetuses being conceived is one case where present actions change the identity of future people. This is relevant to questions of public health policy, as exemplified in some responses to the Zika epidemic. There is philosophical disagreement about the relevance of non-identity: some hold that non-identity is not relevant, while others think that the only morally relevant actions are those that affect specific people. Given this disagreement, we investigated the intuitions about the moral relevance of non-identity within an educated sample of the public, because there was previously little empirical data on the public's views on the non-identity problem.MethodsWe performed an online survey with a sample of the educated general public. The survey assessed participants' preferences between person-affecting and impersonal interventions for Zika, and their views on other non-identity thought experiments, once the non-identity problem had been explained. It aimed to directly measure the importance of non-identity in participants' moral decision-making.ResultsWe collected 763 valid responses from the survey. Half of the participants (50%) had a graduate degree, 47% had studied philosophy at a university level, and 20% had read about the non-identity problem before. Most participants favoured person-affecting interventions for Zika over impersonal ones, but the majority claimed that non-identity did not influence their decision (66% of those preferring person-affecting interventions, 95% of those preferring impersonal ones). In one non-identity thought experiment participants were divided, but in another they primarily answered that impersonally reducing the quality of life of future people would be wrong, harmful and blameworthy, even though no specific individuals would be worse off.ConclusionsNon-identity appeared to play a minor role in participants' moral decision-making. Moreover, participants seem to either misunderstand the non-identity problem, or hold non-counterfactual views of harm that do not define harm as making someone worse off than they would have been otherwise.

DT Article
DE Grand multiparity; Delivery outcomes; Rural Cameroon
ID RISK-FACTORS
AB BackgroundGrand multiparity is a major public health concern especially among developing countries and has been associated with higher risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes compared with women of lesser parity. There is a dearth of evidence on this subject in Cameroon, especially in the rural areas. We therefore carried out this study to document the prevalence and maternal and fetal delivery outcomes of grand multiparity in a rural Cameroonian setting.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective chart review of delivery records from two health facilities (the Oku District Hospital and Kevu Integrated Health Centre) in the Oku Health District over a period of eight years. Data was entered into and analyzed using Epi-Info version 7.0.8.3. The Chi-squared or Fisher's exact test was used to compare categorical variables. The threshold of statistical significance was set at 5%.ResultsA total of 1755 delivery records met our inclusion criteria. The overall prevalence of grand multiparity was 27.0%. We found no significant difference in the rate of selected maternal and fetal delivery outcomes between grand multiparous women and those with lesser parity (p-value>0.05). However, grand multiparous women were less likely to develop second-fourth degree perineal tears compared to their counterparts with lesser parity (odds ratio=0.3, 95% confidence interval=0.2-0.7, p=0.001).ConclusionOur study depicts a high prevalence of grand multiparous delivery in this rural community. With the exception of severe perineal tear, grand multipara and their babies are as likely to develop adverse delivery outcomes as their counterparts with lesser parity. There is also the need to enhance existing government policies on reproductive health in rural areas.

AB BackgroundPregnant women are at increased risk of influenza-related complications. The World Health Organisation recommends influenza vaccination to this high-risk population as highest priority. However, achieving high influenza vaccine coverage among pregnant women remains challenging. We conducted a cross-sectional survey to estimate the coverage and determinants of influenza vaccination among pregnant women in Singapore.MethodsBetween September and November 2017, pregnant women aged >= 21years were recruited at two public hospitals in Singapore. Participants completed an anonymous, self-administered online questionnaire assessing participants' influenza vaccination uptake, knowledge of and attitudes towards influenza and the influenza vaccine, vaccination history, willingness to pay for the influenza vaccine, and external cues to vaccination. We estimated vaccine coverage and used multivariable Poisson models to identify factors associated with vaccine uptake.ResultsResponse rate was 61% (500/814). Only 49 women (9.8, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 7.3-12.7%) reported receiving the vaccine during their current pregnancy. A few misconceptions were identified among participants, such as the belief that influenza can be treated with antibiotics. The most frequent reason for not being vaccinated was lack of recommendation. Women who were personally advised to get vaccinated against influenza during pregnancy were 7 times more likely to be vaccinated (prevalence ratio (PR)=7.11; 95% CI: 3.92-12.90). However, only 12% of women were personally advised to get vaccinated. Other factors associated with vaccine uptake were vaccination during a previous pregnancy (PR=2.51; 95% CI: 1.54-4.11), having insurance to cover the cost of the vaccine (PR=2.32; 95% CI: 1.43-3.76), and higher vaccine confidence (PR=1.62; 95% CI: 1.30-2.01).ConclusionsInfluenza vaccination uptake among pregnant women in Singapore is low. There is considerable scope for improving vaccination coverage in this high-risk population through vaccination recommendations from healthcare professionals, and public communication targeting common misconceptions about influenza and influenza vaccines.

AB BackgroundAlthough the black-white gap in life expectancy has narrowed in the U.S., there is considerable variability across states. In Wisconsin, the black-white gap exceeds 6years, well above the national average. Reducing this disparity is an urgent public health priority, but there is limited understanding of what contributes to Wisconsin's racial gap in longevity. Our investigation identifies causes of death that contribute most to Wisconsin's black-white gap in life expectancy among males and females, and highlights specific ages where each cause of death contributes most to the gap.MethodsOur study employs 1999-2016 restricted-use mortality data provided by the National Center for Health Statistics. After generating race- and sex-specific life tables for each 3-year period of observation (e.g., 1999-2001), we trace recent trends in the black-white life expectancy gap in Wisconsin. We subsequently conduct a series of analyses to decompose the black-white gap in three time periods into 13 separate causes and 19 different age groups.ResultsIn 2014-16, Wisconsin's black-white gap in life expectancy was 7.34years for males (67% larger than the national gap), and 5.61years for females (115% larger than the national gap). Among males, homicide was the single largest contributor, accounting for 1.56years of the total gap. Heart disease and cancer followed, contributing 1.43 and 1.42years, respectively. Among females, heart disease and cancer were the two leading contributors to the gap, accounting for 1.12 and 1.00years, respectively. Whereas homicide contributed most to the racial gap in male longevity during late adolescence and early adulthood, heart disease and cancer exerted most of their influence between ages 50-70 for both males and females. Other notable contributors were unintentional injuries (males), diabetes and cerebrovascular disease (females), and perinatal conditions (males and females).ConclusionsOur study identifies targets for future policy interventions that could substantially reduce Wisconsin's racial gap in life expectancy. Concerted efforts to eliminate racial disparities in perinatal mortality and homicide early in the life course, and chronic conditions such as cancer and heart disease in later life, promise to help Wisconsin achieve the public health objective of racial parity in longevity.

AB BackgroundDespite the fact that testicular cancer presents good prognosis, wide variations in mortality rates have been reported internationally. In Brazil, mortality trends and estimates have not been fully assessed. The objective of the study presented herein is to analyze the mortality trends for testicular cancer in Brazil in the period 2001-2015 and calculate mortality predictions for the period 2016-2030.MethodsThis is a population-based ecological study that utilized information of the Mortality Information System, on testicular cancer-related deaths in Brazil. Mortality trends were analyzed by Joinpoint regression, and Nordpred was utilized for the calculation of predictions.ResultsThe mortality rate for men, standardized to the world population, varied between 0.36/100,000 for the year 2001, to 0.41/100,000 for the year 2015. There was an increasing trend for Brazil (APC=1.3% CI95% 0.6; 2.0) and the Southeast region (APC=1.5% CI95%0.2; 2.7). When analyzing Brazilian data for the period 2016-2030, predictions indicate 2888 deaths due to testicular cancer, which corresponds to a 26.6% change when compared to the 2011-2015 period. This change is mostly explained by an increase in the risk of death (14.2%) when compared with modifications in the demographic structure (12.4%).ConclusionsTesticular cancer mortality in Brazil presents increasing trends, and until 2030 these rates continue to increase.

AB BackgroundInfluenza generates a significant societal impact on morbidity, mortality, and associated costs. The study objective was to identify factors associated with influenza-like-illness (ILI) episodes during seasonal influenza epidemics among the general population.MethodsA prospective study was conducted with the GrippeNet.fr crowdsourced cohort between 2012/13 and 2017/18. After having completed a yearly profile survey detailing socio-demographic, lifestyle and health characteristics, participants reported weekly data on symptoms. Factors associated with at least one ILI episode per influenza epidemic, using the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control case definition, were analyzed through a conditional logistic regression model.ResultsFrom 2012/13 to 2017/18, 6992 individuals participated at least once, and 61% of them were women (n=4258). From 11% (n=469/4140 in 2013/14) to 29% (n=866/2943 in 2012/13) of individuals experienced at least one ILI during an influenza epidemic. Factors associated with higher risk for ILI were: gender female (OR=1.29, 95%CI [1.20; 1.40]), young age (<5years old: 3.12 [2.05; 4.68]); from 5 to 14years old: 1.53 [1.17; 2.00]), respiratory allergies (1.27 [1.18; 1.37]), receiving a treatment for chronic disease (1.20 [1.09; 1.32]), being overweight (1.18 [1.08; 1.29]) or obese (1.28 [1.14; 1.44]), using public transport (1.17 [1.07; 1.29]) and having contact with pets (1.18 [1.09; 1.27]). Older age (>= 75years old: 0.70 [0.56; 0.87]) and being vaccinated against influenza (0.91 [0.84; 0.99]) were found to be protective factors for ILI.ConclusionsThis ILI risk factors analysis confirms and further completes the list of factors observed through traditional surveillance systems. It indicates that crowdsourced cohorts are effective to study ILI determinants at the population level. These findings could be used to adapt influenza prevention messages at the population level to reduce the spread of the disease.

AB BackgroundHearing loss is among the leading causes of disability in persons 65years and older worldwide and is known to have an impact on quality of life as well as social, cognitive, and physical functioning. Our objective was to assess statewide prevalence of self-reported hearing ability in Arizona adults and its association with general health, cognitive decline, diabetes and poor psychosocial health.MethodsA self-report question on hearing was added to the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a telephone-based survey among community-dwelling adults aged >18years (n=6462). Logistic and linear regression were used to estimate the associations between self-reported hearing loss and health outcomes.ResultsApproximately 1 in 4 adults reported trouble hearing (23.2, 95% confidence interval: 21.8, 24.5%), with responses ranging from a little trouble hearing to being deaf. Adults reporting any trouble hearing were at nearly four times higher odds of reporting increased confusion and memory loss (OR 3.92, 95% CI: 2.94, 5.24) and decreased odds of reporting good general health (OR=0.50, 95% CI: 0.40, 0.64) as compared to participants reporting no hearing difficulty. Those reporting any trouble hearing also reported an average 2.5 more days of poor psychosocial health per month (beta=2.52, 95% CI: 1.64, 3.41). After adjusting for sex, age, questionnaire language, race/ethnicity, and income category the association between diabetes and hearing loss was no longer significant.ConclusionsSelf-reported hearing difficulty was associated with report of increased confusion and memory lossand poorer general and psychosocial health among Arizona adults. These findings support the feasibility and utility of assessing self-reported hearing ability on the BRFSS. Results highlight the need for greater inclusion of the full range of hearing disability in the planning process for public health surveillance, programs, and services at state and local levels.

AB BackgroundIt is increasingly recognized that improving the quality of maternal health care delivery is of utmost importance in many countries. In Laos, the quality of antenatal care (ANC) service remains inadequate, but it has never been assessed thoroughly. This study aims to determine the ANC quality at the urban and rural public health facilities in Laos and provides suggestions to improve health education and counseling in addition to other routine care in public ANC services.MethodsThis health-facility based, cross-sectional observation study included both health providers (n=77) and pregnant women (n=421) from purposively selected health facilities (n=16). Information on the mothers' current pregnancies, previous visits and their last children was collected. The time spent for each ANC session as well as ANC services provided were recorded. Descriptive and inferential statistics were applied to analyze the data.ResultsOverall performance of ANC services by health care providers was poor in both urban and rural areas. Insufficient provision of information on danger signs during pregnancy, nutrition, breast feeding and iron supplements was revealed. Generally the communication skills, behavior and attitude of health providers were very poor. Less than a quarter of pregnant women were treated with kindness and respect. Only 4% of the observed ANC session took privacy into consideration. Less than 10% of available information materials were used during each ANC session. None of the health providers in both rural and urban areas performed specific counseling. Overall mean (SD) time-spent for each ANC session was 16.21 (4.28) minutes. A positive correlation was identified between the length of working experience of health providers and their physical performance scores (adjusted R square=0.017).ConclusionsThe overall performance of ANC services by health care providers was inadequate in both urban and rural areas. Insufficient provision of health education and poor communication skills of health care providers were revealed. Existing IEC materials were scarcely used. Taking action to improve the quality of ANC services by training and providing specific guidelines, creating dedicated rooms, and providing sufficient and effective materials for counseling are all greatly needed in public health facilities in Laos.

AB BackgroundEmerging genomic technologies promise more efficient infectious disease control. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is increasingly being used in tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis, surveillance, and epidemiology. However, while the use of WGS by public health agencies may raise ethical, legal, and socio-political concerns, these challenges are poorly understood.MethodBetween November 2017 and April 2018, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 key stakeholders across the fields of governance and policy, public health, and laboratory sciences representing the major jurisdictions currently using WGS in national TB programs. Thematic analysis of the interviews was conducted using NVivo 11.ResultsRespondents identified several ethical and practical challenges associated with WGS in TB care and surveillance, all related to issues of trust, including: 1) the power of public health; 2) data sharing and profits derived from surveillance efforts; and 3) concerns regarding who has access to, and can benefit from, the technology. Additional challenges included: the potential utility that WGS adds to a public health program, the risks associated with linking necessary epidemiological metadata to the genomic data, and challenges associated with jurisdictional capacity to implement the technology.ConclusionsSuccessful implementation of WGS is dependent on fostering relationships of trust between those working with genomics technology and those directly impacted by it, including clinicians. Building trust (a) between the public and the public health agencies and (b) within public health agencies themselves is critical due to the inherent complexity of WGS and its implementation for communicable disease control purposes.

TI Breaking down the barriers: Understanding migrant workers' access to
   healthcare in Malaysia
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID FOREIGN-WORKERS; PROFICIENCY; IMMIGRANTS; LANGUAGE; POLICIES
AB Background
   Malaysia is widely credited to have achieved universal health coverage for citizens. However, the accessibility of healthcare services to migrant workers is questionable. Recently, medical fees for foreigners at public facilities were substantially increased. Mandatory health insurance only covers public hospital admissions and excludes undocumented migrants. This study explores barriers to healthcare access faced by documented and undocumented migrant workers in Malaysia.
   Methods
   We use qualitative data from 17 in-depth interviews conducted with key informants from civil society organisations, trade unions, academia, medical professionals, as well as migrant workers and their representatives. We interviewed doctors working in public hospitals and private clinics frequented by migrants. Data were analysed using thematic analysis.
   Results
   We found that healthcare services in Malaysia are often inaccessible to migrant workers. Complex access barriers were identified, many beyond the control of the health sector. Major themes include affordability and financial constraints, the need for legal documents like valid passports and work permits, language barriers, discrimination and xenophobia, physical inaccessibility and employer-related barriers. Our study suggests that government mandated insurance for migrant workers is insufficient in view of the recent increase in medical fees. The perceived close working relationship between the ministries of health and immigration effectively excludes undocumented migrants from access to public healthcare facilities. Language barriers may affect the quality of care received by migrant workers, by inadvertently resulting in medical errors, while preventing them from giving truly informed consent.
   Conclusions
   We propose instituting migrant-friendly health services at public facilities. We also suggest implementing a comprehensive health insurance to enable healthcare access and financial risk protection for all migrant workers. Non-health sector solutions include the formation of a multi-stakeholder migration management body towards a comprehensive national policy on labour migration which includes health.

   UNHEALTHY BEHAVIORS; CONSUMPTION; ALCOHOL; INDICATORS; MORTALITY;
   CHILDREN
AB Background
   The major non-communicable chronic diseases (NCD) are associated with a small group of modifiable lifestyle-related risk factors, including smoking, insufficient physical activity, unhealthy eating, and alcohol abuse. In this study, we evaluated the co-occurrence and clustering of the major NCD risk factors among Brazilian adolescents.
   Methods
   This cross-sectional study analyzed data of 101,607 adolescents from the Brazilian National Survey of School Health (PeNSE) 2015. The risk factors included were: regular consumption of ultra-processed foods, irregular consumption of fruits and vegetables, insufficient physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Clustering was defined through the ratio between observed and expected prevalences of combination of risk factors greater than 1. Expected prevalence of the co-occurrence of risk factors was calculated from the joint probability of the behaviors. Additionally, we examined the presence of at least four risk factors according to socioeconomic characteristics.
   Results
   Of the 32 combinations of risk factors, 13 corresponded to clustering. We observed a strong correlation between alcohol consumption and smoking, which were found together in 8 of the 13 clusters identified. The most frequent combinations of risk factors involved unhealthy eating and insufficient physical activity. Only 2.9% of the adolescents did not present any risk behaviors, while 38.0%, 32.9%, 9.4% and 1.8% accumulated two, three, four and five risk factors, respectively. The accumulation of risk factors was higher in girls, older adolescents, those who did not live with both parents, children of less-educated mothers, students attending public school, and residents of cities in more developed urban areas of the country.
   Conclusions
   The main risk factors for NCD are frequent and not randomly distributed among Brazilian adolescents. Our results provide information for policymakers to target specific groups and joint behavioral risk factors for health improvement in adolescents.

TI Factors associated with the discontinuation of modern methods of
   contraception in the low income areas of Sukh Initiative Karachi: A
   community-based case control study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Introduction
   Discontinuation of a contraceptive method soon after its initiation is becoming a public health problem in Low middle income countries and may result in unintended pregnancy and related unwanted consequences. A better understanding of factors behind discontinuation of a modern method would help in designing interventions to continue its use till desired spacing goals are achieved.
   Objective
   To determine factors associated with the discontinuation of modern contraceptive methods within six months of its use compared to continued use of modern method for at least six months in low-income areas of Karachi, Pakistan.
   Methods
   A community-based case-control study was conducted in low-income areas of Karachi. Cases were 137 users who discontinued a modern contraceptive method within 6 months of initiation and were not using any method at the time of interview, while controls were 276 continuous users of modern method for at least last six months from the time of interview. Information was collected by using a structured questionnaire. Applied logistic regression was used to identify the associated factors for discontinuation.
   Results
   The mean ages of discontinued and continued users were 29.3 +/- 5.3 years and 29.2 +/- 5.4 years respectively. A larger proportion of the discontinued users had no formal education (43.8%) as compared to the continued users (27.9%). The factors associated with discontinuation of a modern method of contraception were belonging to Sindhi ethnicity [OR: 2.54, 95% CI 1.16-5.57], experiencing side effects [OR: 15.12; 95% CI 7.50-30.51], difficulty in accessing contraceptives by themselves [OR: 0.40, 95% CI 0.19-0.83] and difficulty in reaching clinics for management of the side effects [OR: 4.10, 95% CI 2.38-7.05]. Moreover, women having support from the husband for contraceptive use were less likely to discontinue the method [OR: 0.58, 95% CI 0.34-0.98].
   Conclusions
   Sindhi ethnicity and side effects of modern methods of contraception were identified as major factors for discontinuation in low-income populations. Similarly, women who had difficulty in travelling to reach clinics for treatment also contributed to discontinuation. Furthermore, women using long acting methods and those supported by their husbands were less likely to discontinue the contraceptive methods. Findings emphasize a need to focus on Sindhi ethnicity and trainings of service providers on management of side effects and provision of high quality of services.

TI Is religiousness really helpful to reduce depressive symptoms at old

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID EURO-D SCALE; MAJOR DEPRESSION; MENTAL-HEALTH; SERVICE ATTENDANCE;
   SOCIAL SUPPORT; LATE-LIFE; RELIGIOSITY; SPIRITUALITY; ASSOCIATION;
   INVOLVEMENT
AB Background
   Higher levels of religiousness are associated with better mental health outcomes, but most of previous research is cross-sectional, failing to address issues of selection and reverse causation.
   Methods
   We assessed the longitudinal association between both public and private religiousness and depressive symptoms, drawing on data from 7,719 persons aged 65 and older of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). Repeated measurements of different aspects of religiousness and depressive symptoms were used in random and fixed-effects models in order to assess the effect of changes in religious behavior on changes in depressive symptoms.
   Results
   Praying more than once a day was associated with more depressive symptoms (beta = 0.150, 95% CI: 0.003, 0.298) relative to individuals who never pray, adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics, physical health covariates and history of depression, but the comparison with the fixed effects model suggests that this is the result of a selection effect. Participating weekly or more in a religious organization was associated with fewer depressive symptoms (beta = -0.219, 95% CI: -0.344, -0.094), but this appeared to be spurious after taking due account of possible confounders (beta = -0.092, 95% CI: -0.223, 0.038). Focusing on within-persons changes, we found that participating in religious organizations weekly or more was associated with more depressive symptoms (beta = 0.275, 95% CI: 0.075, 0.475).
   Conclusion
   Our findings do not support that religious behavior, both public or private, may be beneficial for the mental health of older Europeans.

DE Veterans; CKD; Kidney disease
ID PUBLIC-HEALTH PROBLEM; MORTALITY
AB BackgroundThe development of large-scale chronic kidney disease (CKD) cohorts within the Veterans Affairs (VA) system has been limited by several factors, including the high proportion of missing race data etc. The goal of this study is to address the limitations of prior studies by creating a large cohort utilizing robust KDIGO recommendations for identifying and staging CKD.MethodsMultiple patient and administrative files from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) National Patient Care were linked to create a national cohort of Veterans with chronic kidney disease (CKD) between January 2000 - December 2012; patients identified during this period were followed until 2015. CKD was defined for stages 1 through 5 if markers of kidney damage, specifically proteinuria, were present for at least 3 months. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values were calculated based on serum creatinine levels and the patient's age, gender, and race using both the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formulas.ResultsAbout 50 million observations were collected that supported a CKD diagnosis during the study period; these observations corresponded to 3,051,001 unique veterans; 80.9% were non-Hispanic white (NHW), 13.4% were non-Hispanic black (NHB), 3.6% were Hispanic, and 2.0% were in other groups. The mean age 76.7, about 97% were male and 50.2% died prior to January 2016. Among those with stage 3, 12.3% progressed to stage 4, 21.6% of those with stage 4 progressed to stage 5. We found that eGFR values calculated from serum creatinine levels identified about 98% of all patients, while about 11.4% of patients could be identified through ICD-9 codes; only 6.4% could be identified through both sources.ConclusionThis 13-year national cohort provides an important resource for answering numerous research questions in the future such as racial/ethnic disparities questions, tracking health service utilization, medication adherence, cost and health outcomes in veterans with CKD.

AB BackgroundsSuicidal ideation is an important public health issue due to devastating mortality. In the meantime, interpersonal trust was found to be negatively associated with mental disorder and physical health. Although there is increasing evidence that interpersonal trust is a significant predictor of suicidal ideation, evidence of this association is still lacking in the developing world. The aim of this study was to test the association between interpersonal trust and suicidal ideation among older adults in China.MethodsUsing a multi-stage stratified sampling strategy, 7070 older adults aged 60 and above from Shandong Province, China were recruited in this study. Socio-demographic characteristics, health status, family relationship, psychological distress, interpersonal trust and suicidal ideation in the last 12months were obtained through face to face interviews. The association between interpersonal trust and suicidal ideation was assessed using multiple logistic regression models adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics, health status, family relationship and psychological distress.Results7.1% of participants reported suicidal ideation in the past 12months, which was related to gender, resident area, marital status, educational level, self-rated economic, chronic disease, self-rated health status and family relationship within 1 month, psychological distress and interpersonal trust. After adjusting for sociodemographic factors, health status, family relationship and psychological distress, interpersonal mistrust was associated with two times odds of suicidal ideation when compared to interpersonal trustConclusionsThe interpersonal trust was associated with suicidal ideation among elderly in Shandong, China. Intervention approaches regarding inducing and promoting interpersonal trust should be developed to prevent suicide.

AB Background: With increasing demand for red meat in Tanzania comes heightened potential for zoonotic infections in animals and humans that disproportionately affect poor communities. A range of frontline government employees work to protect public health, providing services for people engaged in animal-based livelihoods (livestock owners and butchers), and enforcing meat safety and food premises standards. In contrast to literature which emphasises the inadequacy of extension support and food safety policy implementation in low-and middle-income countries, this paper foregrounds the 'street-level diplomacy' deployed by frontline actors operating in challenging contexts.
   Methods: This research is based on semi-structured interviews with 61 government employees, including livestock extension officers/meat inspectors and health officers, across 10 randomly-selected rural and urban wards.
   Results: Frontline actors combined formal and informal strategies including the leveraging of formal policy texts and relationships with other state employees, remaining flexible and recognising that poverty constrained people's ability to comply with health regulations. They emphasised the need to work with livestock keepers and butchers to build their knowledge to self-regulate and to work collaboratively to ensure meat safety. Remaining adaptive and being hesitant to act punitively unless absolutely necessary cultivated trust and positive relations, making those engaged in animal-based livelihoods more open to learning from and cooperating with extension officers and inspectors. This may result in higher levels of meat safety than might be the case if frontline actors stringently enforced regulations.
   Conclusion: The current tendency to view frontline actors' partial enforcement of meat safety regulations as a failure obscures the creative and proactive ways in which they seek to ensure meat safety in a context of limited resources. Their application of 'street-level diplomacy' enables them to be sensitive to local socio-economic realities, to respect local social norms and expectations and to build support for health safety interventions when necessary. More explicitly acknowledging the role of trust and positive state-society relations and the diplomatic skills deployed by frontline actors as a formal part of their inspection duties offers new perspectives and enhanced understandings on the complicated nature of their work and what might be done to support them.

TI Considering health and health disparities during state policy
   formulation: examining Washington state Health Impact Reviews
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE State policy; Health in all Policies; Legislation; Disparities; Public
   health
AB Background: As part of efforts to expand Health in All Policies (HiAP) in Washington State in the U.S., the Washington State Board of Health (BOH) received statutory authority in 2006 to conduct Health Impact Reviews (HIRs). HIRs analyze the potential impacts of proposed legislation and budget decisions on health and health disparities. Public health professionals who are aware of HIRs are interested in adopting a similar process in their states; however, there is limited information about HIRs, how they are perceived, and how they could advance HiAP.
   Methods: This research involved a descriptive analysis of a sample of HIRs and semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 17 key informants. For the descriptive analysis, all HIRs requested or completed between January 1, 2007 and April 1, 2016 that had a request form submitted by a legislator or the governor that was available in the BOH's online database were reviewed. Information was collected on several variables including the bill number and title, sponsor and political affiliation, and the sector to which the bill or budgetary proposal pertained. A purposeful sample of legislators, staff, advocates, and lobbyists who were involved with HIRs during the study period were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews. Topic coding was used to identify key themes from the qualitative data.
   Results: During the study period, 20 legislators requested 36 HIRs; 32 HIRs were completed. HIRs were requested for several bill topics, including education (11/36) and labor and employment (9/36). Legislators who requested HIRs felt they provided valuable data on health and health disparities for proposed bills. Individuals who were less supportive of HIRs perceived them as an advocacy or political tool. The main barrier to widespread use of HIRs in Washington was a lack of awareness among legislators.
   Conclusions: HIRs are one strategy to advance HiAP for state policy decisions. HIRs are a potentially effective tool for highlighting how legislative proposals and budgets positively and negatively impact health and health disparities. Future efforts should promote awareness and highlight shared benefits of HIRs among legislators and their staff, as well as their scientific integrity, methodological rigor, and objectivity.

ID GLOBAL CHARTER
AB BackgroundWhen microorganisms (such as bacteria or viruses) are highly exposed to antimicrobial drugs, they can develop the capacity to defeat the drugs designed to eradicate them. Long-term accumulation of adaptations to survive drug exposure can lead to the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The success of antibiotics has led to their widespread overuse and misuse in humans, animals and plants.Main textAMR is a global concern and solutions are not vertical actions in a single buy business model.Even if a transectoral approach is key, there is a lack of multi-disciplinary partnerships that allow for strategic cooperation between different sectors such as the pharmaceutical industry, agro-alimentary complex, patient care and education, NGOs and research and development. Global public health voices should lead this integration to align the progress of existing AMR successes. Maintaining the public's trust in preventive medicine, health systems and food production safety, together with public health driven, non-profit drug development, is a key factor. In its Call for integrated action on AMR, signed by about 70 national and international organizations the World Federation of Public Health Associations (WFPHA) called on all governments, the private sector, non-governmental organizations, health professionals, public and private research organizations, and all stakeholders to ensure that public health remains at the centre of all policy and scientific endeavours in the field of antimicrobial resistance.ConclusionsThe Global Charter for the Public's Health, developed by the WFPHA in association with WHO, is proposed in this article as a tool for implementation of complex public health actions such as AMR.

   INFANT-MORTALITY; TRIAL; PREGNANCY; COUNTRY
AB Background Low birthweight (LBW) remains the most important risk factor which attributed to mortality of 15-20% of newborns across the globe. An infant with low birthweight is more likely to have stunting in childhood and develop markers of metabolic risk factors at his later age. Furthermore, LBW is a risk for inter-generational assaults of malnutrition as it is the risk for sub optimal growth until adulthood, affecting women's and male's reproductive capabilities. Thus, there is enough concern to study the determinants of LBW across different settings. Accordingly, this study was conducted to assess the determinants of low birthweight s in public health facilities of Nekemte town, West Ethiopia.
   Methods Facility based unmatched case control study was employed from February to April 2017. The data were collected using structured, pretested interviewer administered questionnaire in all public health facilities of Nekemte town. Consecutive live births of less than 2500g in each of the hospitals and health centres were selected as cases and succeeding babies with weights of at least 2500g as controls. Data were entered in to Epi-data software version 3.1 and exported to SPSS Version 21 and analyzed using frequency, cross-tabs and percentage. Factors with p-value < 0.25 in Bivariate analysis were entered in to multivariable logistic regression and statistical significance was considered at p-value < 0.05.
   Result A total 279 (93 cases &186 controls) were included in the study with a mean birthweight of 2138.3gSD 206.87 for cases and 3145.95g +/- SD 415.98 for controls. No iron-folate supplementation (AOR=2.84, 95% CI, 1.15-7.03), no nutritional counselling (AOR=4.05, 95%CI, 1.95-8.38), not taking snacks (AOR =3.25, 95%CI, 1.64-6.44), maternal under nutrition (AOR =5.62, 95%CI, 2.64-11.97), anemia (AOR=3.54, 95%CI, 1.46-8.61) and inadequate minimum dietary diversity score of women MDDS-W (AOR=6.65, 95%CI, 2.31-19.16) were factors associated with low birthweight.
   Conclusion Lacking nutrition counselling during pregnancy, lacking iron/folic acid supplementation during pregnancy, not taking snacks during pregnancy, maternal under-nutrition, maternal anemia and inadequate minimum dietary diversity score of women (MDDS-W) were independently associated with LBW. Thus, public health intervention in the field of maternal and child health should address these determinants.

AB BackgroundGlobally, anxiety and depression are the most common complications of the perinatal period (conception to 1year postpartum). It is now recognised that anxiety and depression are more commonly found antenatally than postnatally and represent the greatest risk factor for developing postnatal depression. Research in this space has focused on treatment of postnatal depression, with limited attention paid to preventative strategies for women signalling distress, who are subthreshold for diagnosable illness.Main textThe Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was introduced in 1987 and has since been validated as a depression screening tool in the Australian and international setting. The EPDS has been embedded as a depression screening tool within a broader psychosocial assessment for women who receive their maternity care in the public system in Australia. Owing to perceived service restrictions, an EPDS score must reach a threshold of 13 or more to warrant specific assessment or intervention. Current policy frameworks focus on tertiary prevention models, and those women scoring 10 to 12, who could reasonably be considered as signalling distress or early signs of illness, are not currently offered intervention. The consequences of undetected or untreated perinatal mood or anxiety disorder (often co-morbid) include maternal psychological, social, occupational and physical dysfunction, and extend to deleterious infant and child life-course effects. This provides a strong justification to explore the role of preventative programs for women who are distressed. A range of low-resource, population-based interventions are available and effective. We explore the evidence for a selection of these programs. Further research is needed to decipher their effectiveness as a secondary prevention approach in women who are currently signalling distress during antenatal assessment.ConclusionThe burden of perinatal mood disorders, and their potential for prolonged impact, justify the exploration of preventatively-focused programs in women who signal distress during antenatal care.

AB Background: In addition to administering vaccinations, healthcare professionals (HCPs) also play a crucial role in providing education and advocacy to the public regarding immunizations. Yet, many current and future HCPs are unprepared or reluctant to address the vaccine conversation with hesitant patients. Doctors, pharmacists, and nurses are all recognized as the most trusted sources of vaccine information. By comparing future HCPs in these three distinct programs, we can better understand where potential gaps may lie in their training and education. With insight from students, potential changes to curriculum can improve future HCPs ability to address vaccine hesitancy in their respective careers. The objective of this study was to assess and compare the knowledge, attitudes, and opinions of HCP students on the topic of immunization.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2017 to assess students in nursing, medical, and pharmacy programs at two universities in the state of North Dakota in the United States. The survey assessed six key themes: 1) demographic information; 2) basic vaccine knowledge; 3) vaccine hesitancy; 4) likelihood to recommend vaccines; 5) confidence in addressing vaccine-related topics with patients; 6) an appraisal of the education they have received on vaccinations.
   Results: The survey was completed by 223 participants (overall response rate=23.7%). Results indicated that vaccine-related knowledge varied greatly by program; high knowledge scores were achieved by 74.3% of medical students, 62.7% of pharmacy students, 57.1% of doctor of nursing practice (DNP) students, and 24.7% of bachelor of science in nursing (BSN) students. Over a third (34.2%) of BSN students believed that the current recommended immunization schedule places undue burden on a child's immune system, versus only 4.3% of medical students. Additionally, 54.2% of participants believed that spreading out recommended vaccines over several visits was an appropriate means of reducing parental stress about vaccinating.
   Conclusions: Participant responses suggest that negative attitudes, lack of knowledge, and general discomfort exist across all programs, but especially among nursing students, regarding vaccination. Our findings indicate potential areas where targeted interventions could be implemented to better equip future HCPs in their ability to discuss and educate the public regarding vaccination.

AB BackgroundUK public health organisations perform routine antimicrobial susceptibility tests (ASTs) to characterise the potential for antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella enterica serovars. Genetic determinants of these resistance mechanisms are detectable by whole genome sequencing (WGS), however the viability of WGS-based genotyping as an alternative resistance screening tool remains uncertain. We compared WGS-based genotyping, disk diffusion and agar dilution to the broth microdilution reference AST for 102Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) isolates across 11 antimicrobial compounds.ResultsGenotyping concordance, interpreted using epidemiological cut-offs (ECOFFs), was 89.8% (1007/1122) with 0.83 sensitivity and 0.96 specificity. For seven antimicrobials interpreted using Salmonella clinical breakpoints, genotyping produced 0.84 sensitivity and 0.88 specificity. Although less accurate than disk diffusion (0.94 sensitivity, 0.93 specificity) and agar dilution (0.83 sensitivity, 0.98 specificity), genotyping performance improved to 0.89 sensitivity and 0.97 specificity when two antimicrobials with relatively high very major error rates were excluded (streptomycin and sulfamethoxazole).ConclusionsAn 89.8% concordance from WGS-based AST predictions using ECOFF interpretations suggest that WGS would serve as an effective screening tool for the tracking of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms in S. Typhimurium. For use as a standalone clinical diagnostic screen, further work is required to reduce the error rates for specific antimicrobials.

AB Background
   Intimate partner violence is a thoughtful public health concern and human rights violation towards pregnant women for it has a significant negative health effect on the life of both the mother and her fetus. However, there is a scanty of information about the extent of intimate partner violence during pregnancy in Ethiopia, particularly in the study area. Therefore, the current study was conducted to determine the prevalence of intimate partner violence among pregnant women attending antenatal care and identify associated factors that cause it.
   Methods
   An institution based cross-sectional study was conducted on 409 pregnant women who were attending antenatal care service in Debre Markos town from March 17, 2018 April 28, 2018. Systematic random sampling technique was used to select study participants. A pretested structured questionnaire was used to collect the data. Bivariable and Multivariable logistic regression models were done. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was used to identify factors associated with intimate partner violence during pregnancy.
   Results
   The prevalence of intimate partner violence during current pregnancy was found to be 41.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 36.0-46.0). Of this, the prevalence of psychological, physical, and sexual violence was 29.1%, 21%, 19.8% respectively. Lower educational status of partners (AOR = 3.26, 95%CI: 1.45-7.36), rural residency (AOR = 4.04, 95%CI: 1.17-13.93), frequent alcohol abuse by partner (AOR = 4.79, 95% CI: 2.08-11.04), early initiation of antenatal care (AOR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.24-0.81), the age of women between 17-26 years (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.21, 95%CI: 0.09-0.49),choice of partner by the women only (AOR = 3.26,95% CI:1.24-8.57) were statistically significant factors associated with intimate partner violence towards pregnant women.
   Conclusions
   In this study, the prevalence of intimate partner violence during pregnancy is found to be high. As a result, interventions that would address the above mentioned factors need to be implemented.

AB Introduction
   HIV misdiagnosis leads to severe individual and public health consequences. Retesting for verification of all HIV-positive cases prior to antiretroviral therapy initiation can reduce HIV misdiagnosis, yet this practice has not been not widely implemented.
   Methods
   We evaluated and compared the cost of retesting for verification of HIV seropositivity (retesting) to the cost of antiretroviral treatment (ART) for misdiagnosed cases in the absence of retesting (no retesting), from the perspective of the health care system. We estimated the number of misdiagnosed cases based on a review of misdiagnosis rates, and the number of positives persons needing ART initiation by 2020. We presented the total and per person costs of retesting as compared to no retesting, over a ten-year horizon, across 50 countries in Africa grouped by income level. We conducted univariate sensitivity analysis on all model input parameters, and threshold analysis to evaluate the parameter values where the total costs of retesting and the costs no retesting are equivalent. Cost data were adjusted to 2017 United States Dollars.
   Results and discussion
   The estimated number of misdiagnoses, in the absence of retesting was 156,117, 52,720 and 29,884 for lower-income countries (LICs), lower-middle income countries (LMICs), and upper middle-income countries (UMICs), respectively, totaling 240,463 for Africa. Under the retesting scenario, costs per person initially diagnosed were: $40, $21, and $42, for LICs, LMICs, and UMICs, respectively. When retesting for verification is implemented, the savings in unnecessary ART were $125, $43, and $75 per person initially diagnosed, for LICs, LMICs, and UMICs, respectively. Over the ten-year horizon, the total costs under the retesting scenario, over all country income levels, was $475 million, and was $1.192 billion under the no retesting scenario, representing total estimated savings of $717 million in HIV treatment costs averted.
   Conclusions
   Results show that to reduce HIV misdiagnosis, countries in Africa should implement the WHO's recommendation of retesting for verification prior to ART initiation, as part of a comprehensive quality assurance program for HIV testing services.

AB Suicide is a major public health concern worldwide. This study aimed to predict the suicidal behavior of Chinese university students by studying psychological measures such as hopelessness, orientation to happiness, meaning in life, depression, anxiety, stress, and coping styles. In November 2016, a stratified-clustered-random sampling approach was utilized to select subjects from two large public medical-related universities in Shandong province, China. This sample consisted of 2,074 undergraduate students (706 males, 1,368 females; mean age = 19.79 +/- 1.39 years). The students' major risk factors for suicide were depression, anxiety, stress, and hopelessness, and the students' minor risk factors included orientation to happiness and coping styles (including self-distraction, self-blame and substance use). Notably, the presence of meaning in life had a positive effect on preventing suicide and acted as a protective factor, which suggests that it is important to identify risk factors as well as protective factors relevant to the target population group in order to increase the effectiveness of counseling and suicide prevention programs.

TI Implementation of latent tuberculosis infection screening and treatment
   among newly arriving immigrants in the Netherlands: A mixed methods
   pilot evaluation
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MANAGEMENT
AB Introduction
   To reach pre-elimination levels of tuberculosis (TB) incidence in the Netherlands, prevention of TB among immigrants through diagnosis and treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI) is needed. We studied the feasibility of a LTBI screening and treatment program among newly arriving immigrants for national implementation.
   Methods
   We used mixed methods to evaluate the implementation of LTBI screening and treatment in five Public Health Services (PHS) among immigrants from countries with a TB incidence >50/100,000 population. We used Poisson regression models with robust variance estimators to assess factors associated with LTBI diagnosis and LTBI treatment initiation and reported reasons for not initiating or completing LTBI treatment. We interviewed five PHS teams using a semi-structured method to identify enhancing and impeding factors for LTBI screening and treatment.
   Results
   We screened 566 immigrants; 94 (17%) were diagnosed with LTBI, of whom 49 (52%) initiated and 34 (69%) completed LTBI treatment. LTBI diagnosis was associated with male gender, higher age group, higher TB incidence in the country of origin and lower level of education. Treatment initiation was associated with PHS (ranging from 29% to 86%), lower age group, longer intended duration of stay in the Netherlands, and lower level of education. According to TB physicians, clients and their consulted physicians in the home country lacked awareness about benefits of LTBI treatment. Furthermore, TB physicians questioned the individual and public health benefit of clients who return to their country of origin within the foreseeable future.
   Conclusions
   Doubt of physicians in both host country and country of origin about individual and public health benefits of LTBI screening and treatment of immigrants hampered treatment initiation: the high initiation proportion in one PHS shows that if TB physicians are committed, the LTBI treatment uptake can be higher.

TI Public responses to volunteer community care: Propositions for old age
   and end of life
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PALLIATIVE CARE; PEOPLE; PROJECTIONS; PROVISION
AB Background
   Funding shortages and an ageing population have increased pressures on state or insurance funded end of life care for older people. Across the world, policy debate has arisen about the potential role volunteers can play, working alongside health and social care professionals in the community to support and care for the ageing and dying.
   Aims
   The authors examined self-reported levels of care for the elderly by the public in England, and public opinions of community volunteering concepts to care for the elderly at the end of life. In particular, claimed willingness to help and to be helped by local people was surveyed.
   Methods
   A sample of 3,590 adults in England aged 45 or more from an online access panel responded to a questionnaire in late 2017. The survey data was weighted to be representative of the population within this age band. Key literature and formative qualitative research informed the design of the survey questionnaire, which was further refined after piloting.
   Results
   Preferences for different models of community volunteering were elicited. There was a preference for 'formal' models with increased wariness of 'informal' features. Whilst 32% of adults said they 'might join' depending on whom the group helped, unsurprisingly more personal and demanding types of help significantly reduced the claimed willingness to help. Finally, willingness to help (or be helped) by local community carers or volunteers was regarded as less attractive than care being provided by personal family, close friends or indeed health and care professionals.
   Conclusion
   Findings suggest that if community volunteering to care for elderly people at the end of life in England is to expand it may require considerable attention to the model including training for volunteers and protections for patients and volunteers as well as public education and promotion. Currently, in England, there is a clear preference for non-medical care to be delivered by close family or social care professionals, with volunteer community care regarded only as a back-up option.

AB Ageing populations pose one of the main public health crises of our time. Reprogramming gene expression by altering the activities of sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) can ameliorate deleterious effects of age. Here we explore how a circuit of TFs coordinates pro-longevity transcriptional outcomes, which reveals a multi-tissue and multi-species role for an entire protein family: the E-twenty-six (ETS) TFs. In Drosophila, reduced insulin/IGF signalling (IIS) extends lifespan by coordinating activation of Aop, an ETS transcriptional repressor, and Foxo, a Forkhead transcriptional activator. Aop and Foxo bind the same genomic loci, and we show that, individually, they effect similar transcriptional programmes in vivo. In combination, Aop can both moderate or synergise with Foxo, dependent on promoter context. Moreover, Foxo and Aop oppose the gene-regulatory activity of Pnt, an ETS transcriptional activator. Directly knocking down Pnt recapitulates aspects of the Aop/Foxo transcriptional programme and is sufficient to extend lifespan. The lifespan-limiting role of Pnt appears to be balanced by a requirement for metabolic regulation in young flies, in which the Aop-Pnt-Foxo circuit determines expression of metabolic genes, and Pnt regulates lipolysis and responses to nutrient stress. Molecular functions are often conserved amongst ETS TFs, prompting us to examine whether other Drosophila ETS-coding genes may also affect ageing. We show that five out of eight Drosophila ETS TFs play a role in fly ageing, acting from a range of organs and cells including the intestine, adipose and neurons. We expand the repertoire of lifespan-limiting ETS TFs in C. elegans, confirming their conserved function in ageing and revealing that the roles of ETS TFs in physiology and lifespan are conserved throughout the family, both within and between species.

TI Health checks and cardiovascular risk factor values over six years'
   follow-up: Matched cohort study using electronic health records in
   England
SO PLOS MEDICINE

AB Background
   The National Health Service (NHS) in England introduced a population-wide programme for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention in 2009, known as NHS Health Checks. This research aimed to measure the cardiovascular risk management and cardiovascular risk factor outcomes of the health check programme during six years' follow-up.
   Methods and findings
   A controlled interrupted time series study was conducted. Participants were registered with general practices in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) in England and received health checks between 1 April 2010 and 31 December 2013. Control participants, who did not receive a health check, were matched for age, sex, and general practice. Outcomes were blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and total cholesterol (TC) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL). Analyses estimated the net effect of health check by year, allowing for the underlying trend in risk factor values and baseline differences between cases and controls, adjusting for age, sex, deprivation, and clustering by general practice. There were 127,891 health check participants and 322,910 matched controls. Compared with controls, health check participants had lower BMI (cases mean 27.0, SD 4.8; controls 27.3, SD 5.6, Kg/m(2)), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (cases 129.0, SD 14.3; controls 129.3, SD 15.0, mm Hg), and smoking (21% in health check participants versus 27% in controls), but total and HDL cholesterol were similar. Health check participants were more likely to receive weight management advice (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 5.03, 4.98 to 5.08, P < 0.001), smoking cessation interventions (HR 3.20, 3.13 to 3.27, P < 0.001), or statins (HR 1.24, 1.21 to 1.27, P < 0.001). There were net reductions in risk factor values up to six years after the check for BMI (-0.30, -0.39 to -0.20 Kg/m(2), P < 0.001), SBP (-1.43, -1.70 to -1.16 mm Hg, P < 0.001), and smoking (17% in health check participants versus 25% in controls; odds ratio 0.90, 0.87 to 0.94, P < 0.001). The main study limitation was that residual confounding may be present because randomisation was not employed; health check-associated measurement introduced differential recording that might cause bias.
   Conclusions
   Our results suggest that people who take up a health check generally have lower risk factor values than controls and are more likely to receive risk factor interventions. Risk factor values show net reductions up to six years following a health check in BMI, blood pressure, and smoking, which may be of public health importance.

TI Particulate matter air pollution and national and county life expectancy
   loss in the USA: A spatiotemporal analysis
SO PLOS MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID CANADIAN CENSUS HEALTH; MORTALITY; ASSOCIATIONS; EXPOSURE; PM2.5; ERA
AB Background
   Exposure to fine particulate matter pollution (PM2.5) is hazardous to health. Our aim was to directly estimate the health and longevity impacts of current PM2.5 concentrations and the benefits of reductions from 1999 to 2015, nationally and at county level, for the entire contemporary population of the contiguous United States.
   Methods and findings
   We used vital registration and population data with information on sex, age, cause of death, and county of residence. We used four Bayesian spatiotemporal models, with different adjustments for other determinants of mortality, to directly estimate mortality and life expectancy loss due to current PM2.5 pollution and the benefits of reductions since 1999, nationally and by county. The covariates included in the adjusted models were per capita income; percentage of population whose family income is below the poverty threshold, who are of Black or African American race, who have graduated from high school, who live in urban areas, and who are unemployed; cumulative smoking; and mean temperature and relative humidity. In the main model, which adjusted for these covariates and for unobserved county characteristics through the use of county-specific random intercepts, PM2.5 pollution in excess of the lowest observed concentration (2.8 mu g/m(3)) was responsible for an estimated 15,612 deaths (95% credible interval 13,248-17,945) in females and 14,757 deaths (12,617-16,919) in males. These deaths would lower national life expectancy by an estimated 0.15 years (0.13-0.17) for women and 0.13 years (0.11-0.15) for men. The life expectancy loss due to PM2.5 was largest around Los Angeles and in some southern states such as Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Alabama. At any PM2.5 concentration, life expectancy loss was, on average, larger in counties with lower income and higher poverty rate than in wealthier counties. Reductions in PM2.5 since 1999 have lowered mortality in all but 14 counties where PM2.5 increased slightly. The main limitation of our study, similar to other observational studies, is that it is not guaranteed for the observed associations to be causal. We did not have annual county-level data on other important determinants of mortality, such as healthcare access and quality and diet, but these factors were adjusted for with use of county-specific random intercepts.
   Conclusions
   According to our estimates, recent reductions in particulate matter pollution in the USA have resulted in public health benefits. Nonetheless, we estimate that current concentrations are associated with mortality impacts and loss of life expectancy, with larger impacts in counties with lower income and higher poverty rate.

TI Care practices and neonatal survival in 52 neonatal intensive care units
   in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, India: A cross-sectional study
SO PLOS MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH-CARE; UTTAR-PRADESH; MORTALITY; INTERVENTIONS; QUALITY
AB Background
   The Indian government supports both public- and private-sector provision of hospital care for neonates: neonatal intensive care is offered in public facilities alongside a rising number of private-for-profit providers. However, there are few published reports about mortality levels and care practices in these facilities. We aimed to assess care practices, causes of admission, and outcomes from neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in public secondary and private tertiary hospitals and both public and private medical colleges enrolled in a quality improvement collaborative in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh-2 Indian states with a respective population of 35 and 50 million.
   Methods and findings
   We conducted a cross-sectional study between 30 May and 26 August 2016 as part of a baseline evaluation in 52 consenting hospitals (26 public secondary hospitals, 5 public medical colleges, 15 private tertiary hospitals, and 6 private medical colleges) offering neonatal intensive care. We assessed the availability of staff and services, adherence to evidence-based practices at admission, and case fatality after admission to the NICU using a range of tools, including facility assessment, observations of admission, and abstraction of registers and telephone interviews after discharge. Our analysis is adjusted for clustering and weighted for caseload at the hospital level and presents findings stratified by type and ownership of hospitals. In total, the NICUs included just over 3,000 admissions per month. Staffing and infrastructure provision were largely according to government guidelines, except that only a mean of 1 but not the recommended 4 paediatricians were working in public secondary NICUs per 10 beds. On admission, all neonates admitted to private hospitals had auscultation (100%, 19 of 19 observations) but only 42% (95% confidence interval [CI] 25%-62%, p-value for difference is 0.361) in public secondary hospitals. The most common single cause of admission was preterm birth (25%) followed by jaundice (23%). Case-fatality rates at age 28 days after admission to a NICU were 4% (95% CI 2%-8%), 15% (9%-24%), 4% (2%-8%) and 2% (1%-5%) (Chi-squared p = 0.001) in public secondary hospitals, public medical colleges, private tertiary hospitals, and private medical colleges, respectively, according to facility registers. Case fatality according to postdischarge telephone interviews found rates of 12% (95% CI 7%-18%) for public secondary hospitals. Roughly 6% of admitted neonates were referred to another facility. Outcome data were missing for 27% and 8% of admissions to private tertiary hospitals and private medical colleges. Our study faced the limitation of missing data due to incomplete documentation. Further generalizability was limited due to the small sample size among private facilities.
   Conclusions
   Our findings suggest differences in quality of neonatal intensive care and 28-day survival between the different types of hospitals, although comparison of outcomes is complicated by differences in the case mix and referral practices between hospitals. Uniform reporting of outcomes and risk factors across the private and public sectors is required to assess the benefits for the population of mixed-care provision.

TI Effect of a two-stage intervention package on the cesarean section rate
   in Guangzhou, China: A before-and-after study

AB Background
   The cesarean section (CS) rate has risen globally during the last two decades. Effective and feasible strategies are needed to reduce it. The aim of this study was to assess the CS rate change after a two-stage intervention package that was designed to reduce the overall CS rate in Guangzhou, China.
   Methods and findings
   This intervention package was implemented by the Health Commission of Guangzhou Municipality in 2 stages (October 2010-September 2014 and October 2014-December 2016) and included programs for population health education, skills training for healthcare professionals, equipment and technical support for local healthcare facilities, and capacity building for the maternal near-miss care system. A retrospective repeated cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate influences of the intervention on CS rates. A pre-intervention period from January 2008 to September 2010 served as the baseline. The primary outcome was the CS rate, and the secondary outcomes included maternal mortality ratio (MMR) and perinatal mortality rate (PMR), all obtained from the Guangzhou Perinatal Health Care and Delivery Surveillance System (GPHCDSS). The Cochran-Armitage test was used to examine the trends of the overall CS rate, MMR, and PMR across different stages. Segmented linear regression analysis was used to assess the change of the CS rate over the intervention period.
   A total of 1,921,932 records of births and 108 monthly CS rates from 2008 to 2016 were analyzed. The monthly CS rate declined across the intervention stages (Z = 75.067, p < 0.001), with an average rate of 42.4% at baseline, 39.8% at Stage 1, and 35.0% at Stage 2. The CS rate declined substantially among nulliparous women who delivered term singletons, with an accelerating decreasing trend observed across Stage 1 and Stage 2 (the difference in slopes: -0.09 [95% CI -0.16 to -0.02] between Stage 1 and baseline, p = 0.014; -0.11 [95% CI -0.20 to -0.02] between Stage 1 and Stage 2, p = 0.017). The CS rate in the remaining population increased during baseline and Stage 1 and subsequently decreased during Stage 2. The sensitivity analysis suggested no immediate impact of the universal two-child policy on the trend of the CS rate. The MMR (Z = -4.368, p < 0.001) and PMR (Z = -13.142, p < 0.001) declined by stage over the intervention period.
   One of the main limitations of the study is the lack of a parallel control group. Moreover, the influence of temporal changes in the study population on the CS rate was unknown. Given the observational nature of the present study, causality cannot be confirmed.
   Conclusions
   Apparent decline in the overall CS rate was observed in Guangzhou, China, after the implementation of a two-stage intervention package. The decline was most evident among nulliparous women who delivered term singletons. Despite some limitations for causal inference, Guangzhou's experience in controlling the CS rate by implementing composite interventions with public health education and perinatal healthcare service improvement could have implications for other similar areas with high rates of CS.

AB Antibiotics are a medical wonder, but an increasing frequency of resistance among most human pathogens is rendering them ineffective. If this trend continues, the consequences for public health and for the general community could be catastrophic. The current clinical pipeline, however, is very limited and is dominated by derivatives of established classes, the me too compounds. Here, we have exploited our recent identification of a bacterial toxin to transform it into antibiotics active on multidrug-resistant (MDR) gram-positive and -negative bacterial pathogens. We generated a new family of peptidomimetics-cyclic heptapseudopeptides-inspired from a natural bacterial peptide. Out of the 4 peptides studied, 2 are effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in mild and severe sepsis mouse models without exhibiting toxicity on human erythrocytes and kidney cells, zebrafish embryos, and mice. These new compounds are safe at their active doses and above, without nephrotoxicity. Efficacy was also demonstrated against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and MRSA in a mouse skin infection model. Importantly, these compounds did not result in resistance after serial passages for 2 weeks and 4 or 6 days' exposure in mice. Activity of heptapseudopeptides was explained by the ability of unnatural amino acids to strengthen dynamic association with bacterial lipid bilayers and to induce membrane permeability, leading to bacterial death. Based on structure determination, we showed that cationic domains surrounded by an extended hydrophobic core could improve bactericidal activity. Because 2 peptide analogs, Pep 16 and Pep19, are effective against both MRSA and P. aeruginosa in severe sepsis and skin infection models, respectively, we believe that these peptidomimetics are promising lead candidates for drug development. We have identified potential therapeutic agents that can provide alternative treatments against antimicrobial resistance. Because the compounds are potential leads for therapeutic development, the next step is to start phase I clinical trials.

TI Estimated incidence and Prevalence of noma in north central Nigeria,
   2010-2018: A retrospective study
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID DISEASE
AB Background Noma is a spreading and fulminant disease believed to be native to Sub-Saharan Africa over the last decade and associated with low socioeconomic status of citizens of the region. Within this noma belt, most epidemiological reports regarding the disease have emanated from the north western region of Nigeria. However, our indigenous surgical mission encountered a substantial number of cases of noma and post-noma defects noteworthy of epidemiological representation across north central Nigeria.
   Methods All noma cases encountered within the 8-year study period were included and divided based on clinical signs into acute and sequelae groups. Incidence estimation was based on acute/recently active cases and was calculated using the statistical method proposed by the WHO Oral Health Unit (1994). Period prevalence of noma was calculated considering the population at risk in the zone.
   Findings A total of 78 subjects were included in the study with age ranging from 2-75 years. Twelve subjects (15.4%) presented with acute disease while 66 (84.6%) had various forms of post-noma defects. The estimated incidence of noma in the north central zone was 8.3 per 100000 with a range of 4.1-17.9 per 100000 across various states. Period prevalence of noma which incorporated all cases seen within the study period was 1.6 per 100000 population at risk.
   Conclusion Although noma may be more prevalent in the north western region of Nigeria, substantial number of cases occurs within the north central zone which calls for deliberate public awareness campaign on disease risk factors and prevention, and education of primary health-care providers.
   Author summary Noma, a devouring disease of the orofacial complex, is commonly associated with poverty and impoverished regions of the world especially Sub-Saharan Africa termed the noma belt region of the world. With more reports advocating for full inclusion of noma in the WHO Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) program, the apparent neglect of the disease in north central Nigeria compared to other sub-regions is worrisome as the disease burden in the sub-region has not been reported till date. In this light, a retrospective, cross-sectional survey was conducted to provide epidemiological representation to the cases encountered within an eight-year period by the Cleft and Facial Deformity Foundation (CFDF), an indigenous surgical mission. The incidence of noma was estimated using methods recommended by WHO while the period prevalence was calculated considering the population living below poverty line in the sub-region. This study extrapolates an incidence of 8.3 cases per 100000 and a period prevalence of 1.6 per 100000 persons at risk. Notable is the finding that most individuals encountered were above thirty years of age and suffered varying degree of facial disfigurement consequent to acute noma disease experienced in their childhood/early adolescence. Therefore, we advocate public awareness on the disease risk factors and prevention within the sub-region as well as training of primary health personnel on disease identification, primary care and nearest referral centres. We also identify the need to bolster the efforts of existing health facilities and indigenous surgical missions in the management and rehabilitation of noma cases and survivors.

   PREVALENCE; ATTITUDES; IMPACT; COST
AB Background Taenia solium cysticercosis is a public health and agricultural problem in many low and middle-income countries where health education, sanitation, pig management practices and meat inspection infrastructure are insufficient. Cysticercosis affects both human and animal health and has important economic consequences. Very few studies have been conducted to evaluate the monetary burden of cysticercosis. This study aimed at estimating the 2015 costs associated with cysticercosis in humans and pigs in Mexico.
   Methods The monetary burden of human cysticercosis was estimated based on costs incurred by living with and treating epilepsy and severe chronic headaches associated with neurocysticercosis (NCC). The estimated cost of porcine cysticercosis took into consideration losses due to the reduction in the price of cysticercosis-infected animals. Epidemiologic and economic data were obtained from the published literature, government reports, and setting-specific questionnaires. Latin hypercube sampling methods were employed to sample the distributions of uncertain parameters and to estimate 95% credible regions (95% CRs). All results are reported in 2015 U.S.$.
   Findings The overall monetary burden associated with NCC morbidity was estimated at U.S.$215,775,056 (95% CR U.S.$109,309,560 -U.S.$361,924,224), with U.S.$436 (95% CR: U.S.$296 -U.S.$604) lost per patient. If loss of future years of income and productivity due to NCC-associated deaths was included, this value increased by U.S.$54.26 million, assuming that these individuals earned Mexico's median wage salary. An additional U.S.$19,507,171 (95% CR U.S.$5,734,782 -U.S.$35,913,487) was estimated to be lost due to porcine cysticercosis.
   Conclusions This study suggests that T. solium cysticercosis results in considerable monetary losses to Mexico.
   Author summary Taenia solium cysticercosis is a parasitic disease, which can be transmitted between humans and pigs in areas of the world where pigs are raised in a traditional manner and latrines are not always used by the local population. Because cysticercosis affects humans and pigs, it is important to assess how much this infection costs both the public health and agricultural sectors in endemic countries such as Mexico. Costs associated with infection of both humans and pigs, in Mexico, were estimated using the literature, questionnaires, and publicly available data. Study findings suggest that T. solium cysticercosis results in considerable monetary losses to Mexico. The methodology developed here can be applied to estimate the monetary burden of cysticercosis in other regions in order to better prioritize disease control initiatives.

TI Detection of Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever cases in a severe
   undifferentiated febrile illness outbreak in the Federal Republic of
   Sudan: A retrospective epidemiological and diagnostic cohort study
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID CHILDREN
AB Background Undifferentiated febrile illness (UFI) is one of the most common reasons for people seeking healthcare in low-income countries. While illness and death due to specific infections such as malaria are often well-quantified, others are frequently uncounted and their impact underappreciated. A number of high consequence infectious diseases, including Ebola virus, are endemic or epidemic in the Federal Republic of Sudan which has experienced at least 12 UFI outbreaks, frequently associated with haemorrhage and high case fatality rates (CFR), since 2012. One of these occurred in Darfur in 2015/2016 with 594 cases and 108 deaths (CFR 18.2%). The aetiology of these outbreaks remains unknown.
   Methodology/Principal findings We report a retrospective cohort study of the 2015/2016 Darfur outbreak, using a subset of 65 of 263 outbreak samples received by the National Public Health Laboratory which met selection criteria of sufficient sample volume and epidemiological data. Clinical features included fever (95.8%), bleeding (95.7%), headache (51.6%) and arthralgia (42.2%). No epidemiological patterns indicative of person-to-person transmission or health-worker cases were reported. Samples were tested at the Public Health England Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory using a bespoke panel of likely pathogens including haemorrhagic fever viruses, arboviruses and Rickettsia, Leptospira and Borrelia spp. Seven (11%) were positive for Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) by real-time reverse transcription PCR. The remaining samples tested negative on all assays.
   Conclusions/Significance CCHFV is an important cause of fever and haemorrhage in Darfur, but not the sole major source of UFI outbreaks in Sudan. Prospective studies are needed to explore other aetiologies, including novel pathogens. The presence of CCHFV has critical infection, prevention and control as well as clinical implications for future response. Our study reinforces the need to boost surveillance, lab and investigative capacity to underpin effective response, and for local and international health security.
   Author summary The Federal Republic of Sudan has had at least 12 outbreaks of febrile illness of unknown cause associated with symptoms of haemorrhage and high case fatality rates since 2012. Outbreaks without clear diagnosis are concerning, particularly in countries such as Sudan where a range of high consequence diseases, including viral haemorrhagic fevers, are endemic or epidemic, and local laboratory capacity is limited. We transferred historical samples stored in the National Public Health Authority from one of these outbreaks that occurred in Darfur 2015-2016 to the Public Health England Laboratory at Porton, UK, and tested them against a wide range of infectious diseases to try to identify the cause, and to help the Sudanese Federal Ministry of Health to develop and target their limited laboratory capacity. We found that Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever was an important cause but not the only source of cases in this outbreak. This has implications for prevention and control as well as for treating cases. Our study also highlighted the need for future studies to explore other possible causes, including new pathogens, and reinforced the need to boost surveillance, lab and investigative capacity for more timely and complete outbreak response.

AB Background Vector control remains the primary method to prevent dengue infections. Environmental interventions represent sustainable and safe methods as there are limited risks of environmental contamination and toxicity. The objective of this study is to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of the following environmental methods for dengue vector control.
   Methodology/Principal findings Following the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, the Cochrane Library and Google Scholar. Quality assessment was done using the CONSORT 2010 checklist. For the meta-analysis the difference-in-differences (DID) and the difference-of-endlines (DOE) were calculated according to the Schmidt-Hunter method for the Breteau index (BI) and the pupae per person index (PPI). Nineteen studies were eligible for the systematic review, sixteen contributed data to the meta-analysis. The following methods were evaluated: (a) container covers with and without insecticides, (b) waste management and clean-up campaigns, and (c) elimination of breeding sites by rendering potential mosquito breeding sites unusable or by eliminating them. Study quality was highest for container covers with insecticides, followed by waste management without direct garbage collection and elimination of breeding places. Both, systematic review and meta-analysis, showed a weak effect of the interventions on larval populations, with no obvious differences between the results of each individual method. For the meta-analysis, both, container covers without insecticides (BI: DID -7.9, DOE -5) and waste management with direct garbage collection (BI: DID -8.83, DOE -6.2) achieved the strongest reductions for the BI, whereas for the PPI results were almost opposite, with container covers with insecticides (PPI: DID -0.83, DOE 0.09) and elimination of breeding places (PPI: DID -0.95, DOE -0.83) showing the strongest effects.
   Conclusions Each of the investigated environmental methods showed some effectiveness in reducing larval and pupal densities of Aedes sp. mosquitoes. However, there is a need for more comparable high-quality studies at an adequate standard to strengthen this evidence.
   Author summary Dengue is an emerging mosquito-borne viral disease, which is transmitted through the bite of Aedes sp. mosquitoes. The dengue virus causes 390 million infections and 96 million cases every year, and represents a major public health problem in the tropics and subtropics. Although a dengue vaccine was licensed in late 2015, it does not represent a general solution due to significant imperfections. Vector control remains still the primary method to prevent dengue infections. Environmental interventions to control dengue vectors represent sustainable and safe methods as there are limited risks of environmental contamination and toxicity. We provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of the following environmental methods for dengue vector control: container covers with and without insecticides, waste management with and without direct garbage collection, elimination of breeding places. Both, systematic review and meta-analysis, showed a weak effect of the interventions on larval Aedes sp. populations, with no obvious differences between the results of each individual method. However, there is a need for more comparable high-quality studies at an adequate standard to strengthen this evidence.

TI Inhibition of Ebola Virus by a Molecularly Engineered Banana Lectin
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID EFFICACY; GLYCOSYLATION; VACCINES; DISEASE; TRIAL
AB Ebolaviruses cause an often rapidly fatal syndrome known as Ebola virus disease (EVD), with average case fatality rates of similar to 50%. There is no licensed vaccine or treatment for EVD, underscoring the urgent need to develop new anti-ebolavirus agents, especially in the face of an ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the largest ever outbreak in Western Africa in 2013-2016. Lectins have been investigated as potential antiviral agents as they bind glycans present on viral surface glycoproteins, but clinical use of them has been slowed by concerns regarding their mitogenicity, i.e. ability to cause immune cell proliferation. We previously engineered a banana lectin (BanLec), a carbohydrate-binding protein, such that it retained antiviral activity but lost mitogenicity by mutating a single amino acid, yielding H84T BanLec (H84T). H84T shows activity against viruses containing high-mannose N-glycans, including influenza A and B, HIV-1 and -2, and hepatitis C virus. Since ebolavirus surface glycoproteins also contain many high-mannose N-glycans, we assessed whether H84T could inhibit ebolavirus replication. H84T inhibited Ebola virus (EBOV) replication in cell cultures. In cells, H84T inhibited both virus-like particle (VLP) entry and transcription/replication of the EBOV mini-genome at high micromolar concentrations, while inhibiting infection by transcription- and replication-competent VLPs, which measures the full viral life cycle, in the low micromolar range. H84T did not inhibit assembly, budding, or release of VLPs. These findings suggest that H84T may exert its anti-ebolavirus effect(s) by blocking both entry and transcription/replication. In a mouse model, H84T partially (maximally, similar to 50-80%) protected mice from an otherwise lethal mouse-adapted EBOV infection. Interestingly, a single dose of H84T pre-exposure to EBOV protected similar to 80% of mice. Thus, H84T shows promise as a new anti-ebolavirus agent with potential to be used in combination with vaccination or other agents in a prophylactic or therapeutic regimen.
   Author summary There are no approved vaccines or treatments to combat infections with ebolaviruses, which cause Ebola virus disease (EVD), an often rapidly fatal disease characterized by fever and bleeding that results in death in up to similar to 90% of cases. Ebolaviruses are among the most pathogenic viruses that cause human disease and represent a threat to global public health. Outbreaks of EVD occur periodically in African countries and can be exported elsewhere, with recent outbreaks including one ongoing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the largest ever in Western Africa in 2013-2016. There is therefore a great need to develop new vaccines and treatments that target ebolaviruses. We examined whether a lectin (carbohydrate-binding protein), predicted to bind to carbohydrates present on the surface of many viruses and thereby interfere with infection, could block ebolavirus infection and be used for prevention and/or treatment of EVD. We found that the protein blocked ebolavirus infection in cell cultures and, moreover, protected a significant proportion of ebolavirus-infected mice from death, even when administered only once before exposure to virus as a preventive. The protein hence shows promise as a potential agent to prevent and/or treat EVD.

TI Ultrasound-guided minimally invasive autopsy as a tool for rapid
   post-mortem diagnosis in the 2018 Sao Paulo yellow fever epidemic:
   Correlation with conventional autopsy
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID DEATH; AFRICA; ZIKA
AB Background New strategies for collecting post-mortem tissue are necessary, particularly in areas with emerging infections. Minimally invasive autopsy (MIA) has been proposed as an alternative to conventional autopsy (CA), with promising results. Previous studies using MIA addressed the cause of death in adults and children in developing countries. However, none of these studies was conducted in areas with an undergoing infectious disease epidemic. We have recently experienced an epidemic of yellow fever (YF) in Brazil. Aiming to provide new information on low-cost post-mortem techniques that could be applied in regions at risk for infectious outbreaks, we tested the efficacy of ultrasound-guided MIA (MIA-US) in the diagnosis of patients who died during the epidemic.
   Methodology/principal findings In this observational study, we performed MIA-US in 20 patients with suspected or confirmed YF and compared the results with those obtained in subsequent CAs. Ultrasound-guided biopsies were used for tissue sampling of liver, kidneys, lungs, spleen, and heart. Liver samples from MIA-US and CA were submitted for RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry for detection of YF virus antigen. Of the 20 patients, 17 had YF diagnosis confirmed after autopsy by histopathological and molecular analysis. There was 100% agreement between MIA-US and CA in determining the cause of death (panlobular hepatitis with hepatic failure) and main disease (yellow fever). Further, MIA-US obtained samples with good quality for molecular studies and for the assessment of the systemic involvement of the disease. Main extrahepatic findings were pulmonary hemorrhage, pneumonia, acute tubular necrosis, and glomerulonephritis. One patient was a 24-year-old, 27-week pregnant woman; MIA-US assessed the placenta and provided adequate placental tissue for analysis.
   Conclusions MIA-US is a reliable tool for rapid post-mortem diagnosis of yellow fever and can be used as an alternative to conventional autopsy in regions at risk for hemorrhagic fever outbreaks with limited resources to perform complete diagnostic autopsy.
   Author summary Reliable mortality information is of paramount importance to establish sound public health policies. Autopsy is an important tool not only for determining the cause of death, but also for the detection of novel diseases. In the last decades, we have been globally identifying an unprecedented number of emerging infections. Therefore, there is great interest in the development of less invasive and low-cost tools for the accurate post-mortem diagnosis in fatal cases. Minimally invasive autopsy (MIA), conceived as targeting diagnostic biopsies of key organs by needle puncture, has been proposed as an alternative to conventional autopsy (CA) for the determination of cause of death in developing countries. In this research, we tested the efficacy of MIA in the post-mortem diagnosis of 20 patients with suspected or confirmed yellow fever who died during the recent epidemic of yellow fever that occurred in Brazil. There was a perfect agreement between MIA and CA in determining the cause of death (hepatic failure) and main disease (yellow fever) in all patients with confirmed yellow fever. This finding indicates that MIA can be used as an alternative to CA in regions at risk for infectious disease outbreaks with limited resources to perform conventional autopsies.

AB The tetravalent dengue vaccine CYD-TDV (Dengvaxia) is the first licensed vaccine against dengue, but recent findings indicate an elevated risk of severe disease among vaccinees without prior dengue virus (DENV) exposure. The World Health Organization currently recommends CYD-TDV only for individuals with serological confirmation of past DENV exposure. Our objective was to evaluate the potential health impact and cost-effectiveness of vaccination following serological screening. To do so, we used an agent-based model to simulate DENV transmission with and without vaccination over a 10-year timeframe. Across a range of values for the proportion of vaccinees with prior DENV exposure, we projected the proportion of symptomatic and hospitalized cases averted as a function of the sensitivity and specificity of serological screening. Scenarios about the cost-effectiveness of screening and vaccination were chosen to be representative of Brazil and the Philippines. We found that public health impact depended primarily on sensitivity in high-transmission settings and on specificity in low-transmission settings. Cost-effectiveness could be achievable from the perspective of a public payer provided that sensitivity and the value of a disability-adjusted life-year were both high, but only in high-transmission settings. Requirements for reducing relative risk and achieving cost-effectiveness from an individual perspective were more restricted, due to the fact that those who test negative pay for screening but receive no benefit. Our results predict that cost-effectiveness could be achieved only in high-transmission areas of dengue-endemic countries with a relatively high per capita GDP, such as Panama (13,680 USD), Brazil (8,649 USD), Mexico (8,201 USD), or Thailand (5,807 USD). In conclusion, vaccination with CYD-TDV following serological screening could have a positive impact in some high-transmission settings, provided that screening is highly specific (to minimize individual harm), at least moderately sensitive (to maximize population benefit), and sufficiently inexpensive (depending on the setting).
   Author summary Among several viral diseases transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, dengue imposes the greatest and most persistent burden on global health. Efforts to curb its spread would benefit greatly from the availability of an effective vaccine. Currently, the only licensed dengue vaccine, known as CYD-TDV or by the brand name Dengvaxia, is only recommended for use in people who are known to have been exposed to dengue virus in the past. Because symptoms of dengue can range from severe to mild to imperceptible, using clinical history alone to assess whether a person was previously exposed is unreliable. Instead, serological assays, which measure a person's immune response to dengue virus, are necessary to confirm whether a person was previously exposed. Because serological assays can be subject to substantial error, we used a simulation model to assess how impactful CYD-TDV vaccination would be under different scenarios about the accuracy of a serological assay and the intensity of transmission in a given area. We found that the health impact and cost-effectiveness of CYD-TDV vaccination depended on the accuracy of the serological assay, its cost, and the setting in which it is deployed.

AB Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an alphavirus that causes fever and severe polyarthralgia, swept through the Americas in 2014 with almost 2 million suspected or confirmed cases reported by April 2016. In this study, we estimate the direct medical costs, cost of lost wages due to absenteeism, and years lived with disability (YLD) associated with the 2014-2015 CHIKV outbreak in the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI). For this analysis, we used surveillance data from the USVI Department of Health, medical cost data from three public hospitals in USVI, and data from two studies of laboratory-positive cases up to 12 months post illness. On average, employed case-patients missed 9 days of work in the 12 months following their disease onset, which resulted in an estimated cost of $15.5 million. Estimated direct healthcare costs were $2.9 million for the first 2 months and $0.6 million for 3-12 months following the outbreak. The total estimated cost associated with the outbreak ranged from $14.8 to $33.4 million (approximately 1% of gross domestic product), depending on the proportion of the population infected with symptomatic disease, degree of underreporting, and proportion of cases who were employed. The estimated YLDs associated with long-term sequelae from the CHIKV outbreak in the USVI ranged from 599-1,322. These findings highlight the significant economic burden of the recent CHIKV outbreak in the USVI and will aid policy-makers in making informed decisions about prevention and control measures for inevitable, future CHIKV outbreaks.
   Author summary Chikungunya, a virus carried and transmitted by mosquitoes, causes fever, headache, and severe joint pain in humans that often resolves within 7-10 days. However, a proportion of cases, up to 79% in some outbreaks, report persistent joint pain and chronic inflammatory rheumatism, resulting in decreased quality of life for months to years following initial infection. In 2014, chikungunya virus swept through the Americas, resulting in almost 2 million suspected or confirmed cases reported by April 2016. Previous studies have noted the large resource burden from chikungunya outbreaks, including high healthcare costs, lost wages due to absenteeism, and decreased quality of life for months following infection. Our work aimed to estimate the direct medical costs, cost of lost productivity due to absenteeism, and years lived with disability associated with the chikungunya outbreak in the U.S. Virgin Islands. This information may aid policy-makers in making informed decisions about prevention and control measures for inevitable, future chikungunya outbreaks.

AB Extreme weather events affect the development and survival of disease pathogens and vectors. Our aim was to investigate the potential effects of heat waves on the population dynamics of Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus), which is a major vector of dengue and Zika viruses. We modeled the population abundance of blood-fed mosquito adults based on a mechanistic population model of Ae. albopictus with the consideration of diapause. Using simulated heat wave events derived from a 35-year historical dataset, we assessed how the mosquito population responded to different heat wave characteristics, including the onset day, duration, and the average temperature. Two important observations are made: (1) a heat wave event facilitates the population growth in the early development phase but tends to have an overall inhibitive effect; and (2) two primary factors affecting the development are the unusual onset time of a heat wave and a relatively high temperature over an extended period. We also performed a sensitivity analysis using different heat wave definitions, justifying the robustness of the findings. The study suggests that particular attention should be paid to future heat wave events with an abnormal onset time or a lasting high temperature in order to develop effective strategies to prevent and control Ae. albopictus-borne diseases.
   Author summary Understanding the population dynamics of Asian Tiger mosquito (Ae. albopictus)-the most prevalent vector of global epidemics including West Nile virus, dengue fever, Zika-could shed lights on improving the understanding of vector transmission as well as developing effective disease control strategies. It is widely acknowledged that the life cycle of Ae. albopictus is firmly regulated by meteorological factors in a non-linear way and is sensitive to climate change. Our study extends the understanding about how extreme heat events manipulate the mosquito population abundance. We adopted an existing mechanistic population model of Ae. albopictus, combined with a rich set of simulated heat wave events derived from a 35-year historical dataset, to quantify the mosquito's responses to different heat wave characteristics. We found that an abnormal onset time and a lasting high temperature play the most important role in affecting the mosquito population dynamics. We also performed a sensitive analysis by changing the definition of the heat wave, justifying the rigor of the conclusion. This research provides implications for developing public health intervention strategies: to control dengue fever, Zika, as well as other far-reaching mosquito-borne epidemics, priority should be given to heat wave events with an abnormal onset time or a lasting high temperature.

TI Evaluation of Burkholderia mallei Delta tonB Delta hcp1 (CLH001) as a
   live attenuated vaccine in murine models of glanders and melioidosis
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES

AB Background Glanders caused by Burkholderia mallei is a re-emerging zoonotic disease affecting solipeds and humans. Furthermore, B. mallei is genetically related to B. pseudomallei, which is the causative agent of melioidosis. Both facultative intracellular bacteria are classified as tier 1 select biothreat agents. Our previous study with a B. mallei Delta tonB Delta hcp1 (CLH001) live-attenuated vaccine demonstrated that it is attenuated, safe and protective against B. mallei wild-type strains in the susceptible BALB/c mouse model.
   Methodology/Principal finding In our current work, we evaluated the protective efficacy of CLH001 against glanders and melioidosis in the more disease-resistant C57BL/6 mouse strain. The humoral as well as cellular immune responses were also examined. We found that CLH001-immunized mice showed 100% survival against intranasal and aerosol challenge with B. mallei ATCC 23344. Moreover, this vaccine also afforded significant cross-protection against B. pseudomallei K96243, with low level bacterial burden detected in organs. Immunization with a prime and boost regimen of CLH001 induced significantly greater levels of total and subclasses of IgG, and generated antigen-specific splenocyte production of IFN-gamma and IL-17A. Interestingly, protection induced by CLH001 is primarily dependent on humoral immunity, while CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells played a less critical protective role.
   Conclusions/Significance Our data indicate that CLH001 serves as an effective live attenuated vaccine to prevent glanders and melioidosis. The quantity and quality of antibody responses as well as improving cell-mediated immune responses following vaccination need to be further investigated prior to advancement to preclinical studies.
   Author summary Glanders (caused by Burkholderia. mallei) and melioidosis (caused by B. pseudomallei) are severe infectious diseases of concern worldwide because of the rising number of cases and mortality rate. The low infectious doses of these two pathogens along with their amenability for aerosolization are factors that could be exploited as potential biothreat agents. Once the diseases have developed in humans and animals, intrinsic resistance to broad classes of antibiotics becomes a challenge for treatment and increases the risk for relapse. The progress in vaccine development demonstrates that live attenuated vaccine strains are the most effective in protection and providing long-lasting immune responses against both diseases. Our data indicate that the B. mallei double mutant (Delta tonB Delta hcp1) strain CLH001, is a feasible vaccine candidate to prevent glanders and melioidosis, especially for biodefense and public health purposes.

AB Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) caused by Mycobacterium bovis is an important re-emerging disease affecting livestock, wildlife and humans. Epidemiological studies are crucial to identifying the source of bTB infection, and its transmission dynamics and host preference, and thus to the implementation of effective strategies to contain it. In this study, we typed M. bovis isolates from livestock, and investigated their genetic diversity and distribution. A total of 204 M. bovis isolates were collected from cattle (n = 164) and Sicilian black pigs (n = 40) reared in a limited area of the province of Messina, northeastern Sicily, an area that had previously been identified as having the highest incidence of bTB in livestock on the island. All M. bovis isolates were typed by both spoligotyping and 12-loci MIRU-VNTR analysis. Results from both methods were then combined in order to improve the discriminatory power of M. bovis typing. We identified 73 combined genetic profiles. Thirty-five point six percent of the profiles were common to at least two animals, whereas 64.4% of profiles occurred in only one animal. A number of genetic profiles were predominant in either cattle or black pigs. We identified common genetic patterns in M. bovis isolates originating not only from neighboring districts, but also from non-neighboring districts. Our findings suggest that bTB is widespread in our setting, and is caused by a large number of genetically diverse M. bovis strains. The ecology and farming practices characteristic of the area may explain the substantial M. bovis heterogeneity observed, and could represent obstacles to bTB eradication.
   Author summary Bovine tuberculosis is a widespread infectious disease affecting both domestic and wild animals, as well as humans. In addition to being of public health concern, the disease, caused mainly by Mycobacterium bovis, has a significant economic impact on the farming industry due to the costs of eradication efforts. In Sicily, the largest of the Italian islands, bovine tuberculosis in livestock is of great concern, and targeted control strategies are needed. Molecular epidemiology is an essential tool for determining the distribution of a disease, so as to control it and minimize its threat to the population. We typed M. bovis isolates isolated from cattle and pigs reared in a limited area of Sicily. An in-depth comparison of the genetic makeup of these isolates allowed us a better understanding of the genetic diversity and distribution of the pathogen in our population of animals. We found that the disease is widespread in the area and caused by a large variety of M. bovis strains, which are in several cases common to different species of livestock. The paper concludes with a discussion of the findings in light of the environmental and ecological setting, and of farming practices in the area. The results are expected to contribute to the improvement of surveillance and control programs of bovine tuberculosis in the region.

TI Improved assessment of mass drug administration and health district
   management performance to eliminate lymphatic filariasis
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID ASSURANCE SAMPLING LQAS; QUALITY; IVERMECTIN
AB Lymphatic filariasis (LF) elimination as a public health problem requires the interruption of transmission by administration of preventive mass drug administration (MDA) to the eligible population living in endemic districts. Suboptimal MDA coverage leads to persistent parasite transmission with consequential infection, disease and disability, and the need for continuing MDA rounds, requiring considerable investment. Routine coverage reports must be verified in each MDA implementation unit (IU) due to incorrect denominators and numerators used to calculate coverage estimates with administrative data. IU are usually the health districts. Coverage is verified so IU teams can evaluate their outreach and take appropriate action to improve performance. Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have conducted MDA campaigns for LF since 2009 and 2014, respectively. To verify district reports and assess the declared achievement using administrative data of the minimum 80% coverage of eligible people (or 65% of the total population), both countries conducted rapid probability surveys using Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS)(n = 1102) in 2015 and 2016 in 58 IU in 49 districts. The surveys identified IU with suboptimal coverage, reasons residents did not take the medication, place where the medication was received, information sources, and knowledge about diseases prevented by the MDA. LQAS identified four inadequately covered IU triggering district team performance reviews with provincial and national teams and district retreatment. Provincial estimates using probability samples (weighted by populations sizes) were 10 and 17 percentage points lower than reported coverage in DRC and Mozambique. The surveys identified: absence from home during annual MDA rounds as the main reason for low performance and provided valuable information about pre-campaign and campaign activities resulting in improved strategies and continued progress towards elimination of LF and co-endemic Neglected Tropical Diseases.
   Author summary Global elimination of lymphatic filariasis (LF) is achieved through treatment of at-risk populations with annual or bi-annual mass drug administration campaigns. In Africa campaigns need to be completed in 32 countries with 343 million people at risk. The World Health Organisation recommends verification of the campaign's administrative records using household cluster surveys at least once every 5-years. However, cluster surveys are expensive and usually completed in a few districts only or at sub-national levels. Together with National Programmes in Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) we adapted Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) methods to verify campaign coverage because it is relatively inexpensive in comparison to other survey approaches, provides information and facilitates actions at the Implementation Unit (IU) level, which is usually the district. LQAS signals IU whose performance is likely to need improvement because MDA coverage is below the coverage target. Our results show consistently that administrative records over-estimated campaign coverage and did not detect implementation and coverage problems due to errors in numerators and denominators, incorrect reporting, and/or incorrect aggregation of tally sheets. The LQAS verification approach prompted immediate action to remedy coverage shortfalls averting persistent LF transmission and disease, and the costs associated with failed campaigns. Our study demonstrates that a rapid probability sample to verify coverage provides district teams with information after each campaign which can be used for action, and that one coverage survey every 5-years is insufficient for infectious disease elimination in highly endemic settings where achievement of optimal coverage is essential. It also demonstrates that LQAS provides a decentralised assessment, sensitive for detecting and ameliorating programme bottlenecks and can be used to verify MDA in other countries.

AB Background Public health responses to outbreaks of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus have been stymied by the inability to control the primary vector, Aedes aegypti mosquitos. Consequently, the need for novel approaches to Aedes vector control is urgent. Placement of three autocidal gravid ovitraps (AGO traps) in similar to 85% of homes in a community was previously shown to sustainably reduce the density of female Ae. aegypti by >80%. Following the introduction of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) to Puerto Rico, we conducted a seroprevalence survey to estimate the prevalence of CHIKV infection in communities with and without AGO traps and evaluate their effect on reducing CHIKV transmission.
   Methods and findings Multivariate models that calculated adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) showed that among 175 and 152 residents of communities with and without AGO traps, respectively, an estimated 26.1% and 43.8% had been infected with CHIKV (aPR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.37-0.91). After stratification by time spent in their community, protection from CHIKV infection was strongest among residents who reported spending many or all weekly daytime hours in their community:10.3% seropositive in communities with AGO traps vs. 48.7% in communities without (PR = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.11-0.41). The age-adjusted rate of fever with arthralgia attributable to CHIKV infection was 58% (95% CI: 46-66%). The monthly number of CHIKV-infected mosquitos and symptomatic residents were diminished in communities with AGO traps compared to those without.
   Conclusions These findings indicate that AGO traps are an effective tool that protects humans from infection with a virus transmitted by Ae. aegypti mosquitos. Future studies should evaluate their protective effectiveness in large, urban communities.
   Author summary Aedes species mosquitos transmit pathogens of public health importance, including dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses. No tools exist to control these mosquitos that sustainably and effectively prevent human infections. Autocidal gravid ovitraps (AGO traps) have been shown to sustainably reduce Aedes populations by >80%. After chikungunya virus was introduced into Puerto Rico, we conducted serosurveys in communities with and without AGO traps. We observed a two-fold lower prevalence of chikungunya virus infection among residents of communities with AGO traps compared to communities without. Among infected residents of communities with traps, a significant proportion likely had been infected while outside their community. These findings indicate that AGO traps are an effective tool that protects humans from infection with pathogens transmitted by Aedes mosquitos.

AB Background Cryptococcosis is a neglected and predominantly opportunistic mycosis that, in Brazil, poses an important public health problem, due to its late diagnosis and high lethality.
   Methods The present study analysed cryptococcosis mortality in Brazil from January 2000 to December 2012, based on secondary data (Mortality Information System/SIM-DATASUS and IBGE).
   Results Out of 5,755 recorded deaths in which cryptococcosis was mentioned as one of the morbid states that contributed to death, two distinct groups emerged: 1,121 (19.5%) registered cryptococcosis as the basic cause of death, and 4,634 (80.5%) registered cryptococcosis associated with risk factors, mainly AIDS (75%), followed by other host risks (5.5%). The mortality rate by cryptococcosis as the basic cause was 6.19/million inhabitants, whereas the mortality rate by cryptococcosis as an associated cause was 25.19/million inhabitants. Meningitis was the predominant clinical form (80%), males were the more affected (69%), and 39.5 years old was the mean age. The highest mortality rate due to cryptococcosis as basic cause occurred in the state of Mato Grosso (10.96/million inhabitants). Mortality rates due to cryptococcosis as associated cause were highest in the states of Santa Catarina (70.41/million inhabitants) and Rio Grande do Sul (64.40/million inhabitants), both in the South Region. Southeast, Northeast and South showed significant time trends in mortality rates.
   Conclusions This study is relevant because it shows the magnitude of cryptococcosis mortality linked to AIDS and removes the invisibility of a particular non-AIDS-related disease, accounting for almost 20% of all cryptococcosis deaths. It can also contribute to control and surveillance programs, beyond highlighting the urgent prioritization of early diagnosis and proper treatment to reduce the unacceptable mortality rate of this neglected mycosis in Brazil.
   Author summary Cryptococcosis is an invasive, global, and neglected mycosis. Species of the Cryptococcus neoformans complex cause opportunistic infections in immunosuppressed hosts, particularly AIDS patients, while infections by species of the C. gattii complex predominate as a primary endemic mycosis in tropical and subtropical areas. In Brazil, it is an important and hidden public health problem, mainly in its meningitis form, whose lethality ranges from 45 to 65%, but remains as a not-notifiable disease. Brazilian studies placed it as the first cause of mortality among all AIDS-associated systemic mycoses and the second cause of mortality among systemic mycoses in general. This national study used data from the Brazilian Mortality Information System (SIM) in which all mentioned causes were considered, allowing the analysis of the associated causes of deaths and showing two different patterns of infections: a primary and an opportunistic cryptococcosis. Primary cryptococcosis presented a peculiar epidemiological regional profile and the opportunistic cryptococcosis was hidden by several immunosuppressive conditions. The authors expect that this study can support a better understanding of this infection and encourage more research and public health initiatives to prevent and control the cryptococcosis, both primary and opportunistic.

AB Background The Madagascar National Strategic Plan for Malaria Control 2018 (NSP) outlines malaria control pre-elimination strategies that include detailed goals for mosquito control. Primary surveillance protocols and mosquito control interventions focus on indoor vectors of malaria, while many potential vectors feed and rest outdoors. Here we describe the application of tools that advance our understanding of diversity, host choice, and Plasmodium infection in the Anopheline mosquitoes of the Western Highland Fringe of Madagascar.
   Methodology/Principal findings We employed a modified barrier screen trap, the QUadrant Enabled Screen Trap (QUEST), in conjunction with the recently developed multiplex BLOOdmeal Detection Assay for Regional Transmission (BLOODART). We captured a total of 1252 female Anopheles mosquitoes (10 species), all of which were subjected to BLOODART analysis. QUEST collection captured a heterogenous distribution of mosquito density, diversity, host choice, and Plasmodium infection. Concordance between Anopheles morphology and BLOODART species identifications ranged from 93-99%. Mosquito feeding behavior in this collection frequently exhibited multiple blood meal hosts (single host = 53.6%, two hosts = 42.1%, three hosts = 4.3%). The overall percentage of human positive bloodmeals increased between the December 2017 and the April 2018 timepoints (27% to 44%). Plasmodium positivity was frequently observed in the abdomens of vectors considered to be of secondary importance, with an overall prevalence of 6%.
   Conclusions/Significance The QUEST was an efficient tool for sampling exophilic Anopheline mosquitoes. Vectors considered to be of secondary importance were commonly found with Plasmodium DNA in their abdomens, indicating a need to account for these species in routine surveillance efforts. Mosquitoes exhibited multiple blood feeding behavior within a gonotrophic cycle, with predominantly non-human hosts in the bloodmeal. Taken together, this complex feeding behavior could enhance the role of multiple Anopheline species in malaria transmission, possibly tempered by zoophilic feeding tendencies.
   Author summary Malaria continues to be a significant threat to public health in Madagascar. Elimination of this disease is impeded by numerous factors, such as vector surveillance that does little to account for the potential role of secondary malaria vectors, which tend to rest and feed outdoors. In this study, we designed a low cost, modified barrier screen trap, called the QUadrant Enabled Screen Trap (QUEST). We used this in conjunction with the recently developed BLOOdmeal Detection Assay for Regional Transmission (BLOODART) to assess mosquito feeding behavior in the Western Highland Fringe of Madagascar. Our analysis revealed significant variability in mosquito density, diversity, host choice, and Plasmodium infection across traps placed within and between two nearby villages at two timepoints; indicating a strong, small-scale spatial component to disease transmission that warrants further investigation. Many of the mosquitoes in this sample (46.4%) fed on two or three host species, indicating complex feeding behaviors that could influence malaria transmission. Further, Plasmodium DNA was detected in the abdomens of numerous vectors of supposed secondary importance, indicating a neglected parasite reservoir and an increased need to account for these species in routine surveillance efforts.

AB Avian influenza virus H9N2 has been endemic in birds in the Middle East, in particular in Egypt with multiple cases of human infections since 1998. Despite concerns about the pandemic threat posed by H9N2, little is known about the biological properties of H9N2 in this epicentre of infection. Here, we investigated the evolutionary dynamics of H9N2 in the Middle East and identified phylogeny-associated PB2 mutations that acted cooperatively to increase H9N2 replication/transcription in human cells. The accumulation of PB2 mutations also correlated with an increase in H9N2 virus growth in the upper and lower airways of mice and in virulence. These mutations clustered on a solvent-exposed region in the PB2-627 domain in proximity to potential interfaces with host factors. These PB2 mutations have been found at high prevalence during evolution of H9N2 in the field, indicating that they have provided a selective advantage for viral adaptation to infect poultry. Therefore, continuous prevalence of H9N2 virus in the Middle East has generated a far more fit or optimized replication phenotype, leading to an expanded viral host range, including to mammals, which may pose public health risks beyond the current outbreaks.

AB BackgroundThe presence of urban rats in the neighbourhood environment may negatively impact the physical and mental health of residents. Our study sought to describe the experiences with, perceptions of, and feelings towards rats and rat control efforts among a group of disadvantaged urban residents in Vancouver, Canada.MethodsSemi-structured interviews were held with 20 members of the Vancouver Area Network of Drug Users (VANDU) recruited by VANDU staff. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis.ResultsParticipants reported daily sightings of rats and close contact during encounters. Participants generally disliked encountering rats, raising issues of health and safety for themselves and the community due to the belief that rats carry disease. Fear of rats was common, and in some cases resulted in avoidance of rats. Effects of rats on participants were particularly pronounced for those living with rats in the home or for homeless participants who described impacts on sleep due to the sounds made by rats. Although rats were viewed as more problematic in their neighbourhood than elsewhere in Vancouver, participants believed there to be a lack of neighbourhood-level control initiatives that angered and disheartened participants. In combination with other community-level concerns (e.g., housing quality and availability), the presence of rats was viewed by some to align with a general disregard for the community and its residents.ConclusionsThis study suggests that the presence of rats in urban centres may have several consequences on the physical and mental health of residents living in close contact with them. These effects may be exacerbated with continued contact with rats and when residents perceive a lack of initiative to control rats in their neighbourhood. As such, research and policies aimed at mitigating the health risks posed by rats should extend beyond disease-related risk and incorporate diverse health outcomes.

AB BackgroundThis study estimates the prevalence and incidence rates of primary open -angle glaucoma (POAG) as well as risk factors based on a dataset from the largest German health insurance company.MethodsA random sample of 250,000 persons at age 50+ of the Allgemeine Ortskrankenkasse (AOK) from 2010 to 2013 was used. Selected risk factors of POAG incidence were analyzed using multivariate Cox proportional hazard models.ResultsThe age-standardized prevalence of POAG at age 50+ in 2010 was 2.79% (95%-CI: 2.72-2.85%). The age-standardized total incidence rate was 0.38 (0.36-0.39) per 100 person-years. Sex differences were significant for total prevalence and total incidence rates, with higher prevalence and incidence rates for women compared to men. The Cox model revealed a strong age effect, a significantly 19% higher incidence for women (p <= 0.001), injuries of the eye and orbit (175%, p <= 0.001), degeneration of iris and ciliary body (155%, p=0.022), myopia (155%, p <= 0.001), retinal vascular occlusions (134%, p <= 0.001), hypertension (13%, p <= 0.001) and diabetes mellitus (23%, p <= 0.001).ConclusionHealth claims data are an important data source for estimating POAG occurrence and help overcome the problems of small sample sizes. These results may help to understand the causal pathways of POAG and to develop intervention strategies to increase the awareness of patients and physicians with the aim of reducing POAG incidence.

AB BackgroundIncreasing multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) incidence is a major threat against TB eradication worldwide. We aim to conduct a detailed MDR-TB study in Portugal, an European country with endemic TB, combining genetic analysis and epidemiological data, in order to assess the efficiency of public health containment of MRD-TB in the country.MethodsWe used published MIRU-VNTR data, that we reanalysed using a phylogenetic analysis to better describe MDR-TB cases transmission occurring in Portugal from 2014 to 2017, further enriched with epidemiological data of these cases.ResultsWe show an MDR-TB transmission scenario, where MDR strains likely arose and are transmitted within local chains. 63% of strains were clustered, suggesting high primary transmission (estimated as 50% using MIRU-VNTR data and 15% considering epidemiological links). These values are higher than those observed across Europe and even for sensitive strains in Portugal using similar methodologies. MDR-TB cases are associated with individuals born in Portugal and evolutionary analysis suggests a local evolution of strains. Consistently the sublineage LAM, the most common in sensitive strains in Europe, is the more frequent in Portugal in contrast with the remaining European MDR-TB picture where immigrant-associated Beijing strains are more common.ConclusionsDespite efforts to track and contain MDR-TB strains in Portugal, their transmission patterns are still as uncontrolled as that of sensitive strains, stressing the need to reinforce surveillance and containment strategies.

AB BackgroundThe Public Dental Service (PDS) in Finland has catered for the overwhelming majority of the young for more than 50years. They have had examinations, preventive measures and all other necessary treatment free of charge. This study aimed to survey the treatment needs and treatment measures provided for children and adolescents and changes in these during the period 2001-2013.MethodsUsing each person's unique identifier, data on patients (<18years), their oral health (CPI>2, D+d>0) and treatment received in the period 2001-2013 were collected retrospectively from municipal databases in five PDS-units covering 320,000 inhabitants. The National Institute for Health and Welfare gave ethical approval. Permission to use local data was received from the Directors in the PDS units. Treatment measures were grouped into 14 categories and patients into three age categories (0-6years, 7-13years and 14-17years). Trend analysis was used to test changes over time.ResultsAbout 40,000 children and adolescents visited the PDS each year and 2,488,805 treatment measures were provided for them during the entire study period. The proportion of those in need of treatment decreased from 44.4 to 33.2% during the study period. The most common treatment categories were examinations (613,753, 24.7%), orthodontics (499,033, 20.1%), preventive measures (372,473, 15.0%) and restorative treatment (355,325, 14.3%); these made up 74% of all treatment measures. During the study period, statistically highly significant (p<0.001***) increasing trends were found for examinations, anaesthesia and the total number of treatment measures, and a significant (p<0.001***) decreasing trend in restorative treatment were found for all the young. More preventive treatment measures were provided for those not in need of treatment compared with those in need of treatment.ConclusionAlthough children's oral health had improved and restorative treatment provided had decreased, the total number of treatment measures increased. Healthy children received frequent examinations and high numbers of preventive treatment measures. Targeting treatment according to needs was not satisfactory.

AB BackgroundGlobally, in every three preschool children one is affected by malnutrition. In Ethiopia, child undernutrition continues to be a serious public health problem. Data are scarce, especially in 24-59months age children. We aimed at estimating under nutrition and its associated factors among children 24-59months age in Aykel Town, Northwest Ethiopia.MethodsA community based cross-sectional study was conducted among children aged 24-59months in Aykel Town from January to February 2017. A total of 416 children were included in to the study using a systematic random sampling technique. Data were collected by interview and anthropometric measurements. Multivariable analysis was performed to identify the predictors of stunting, wasting and underweight.ResultsThe prevalence of stunting, wasting and underweight were 28.4, 10 and 13.5%, respectively. Children from low birth order; 1(st) (AOR=8.60, 95%CI: 2.40, 3.70) and 2nd -4th (AOR=5.80, 95%CI: 1.80, 18.90), from large family size (AOR=3.67, 95%CI: 1.92, 7.00), and had meal frequency<3/day (AOR=5.09, 95%CI: 2.96, 8.74) were at a higher risk of stunting. Children who had not fed on cow milk (AOR=5.50, 95%CI: 2.30, 13.00), and from mothers who had poor hand washing practice (AOR=11.00, 95%CI: 4.30, 27.9) were more likely to be wasted. Children who had not fed on cow milk (AOR=2.90, 95%CI: 1.40, 6.00), breast fed for less than 24months (AOR=2.60, 95%CI: 1.35, 5.00), consumed foods from less than four food groups (AOR=6.30, 95%CI: 1.70, 23.00), and were from mothers' who had poor hand washing practice (AOR=2.50, 95%CI: 1.30, 4.70) had higher odds of being underweight.ConclusionStunting, wasting and underweight are high among children aged 24-59months in Aykel Town. Poor child feeding and maternal hygienic practices were identified as risk factors of undernutrition. Educating mothers/care givers on the advantages of proper child feeding and maintaining hygienic practices at critical times is valuable in improving the nutritional status of children.

AB BackgroundAnemia is not only a major public health problem among children in developing countries, it is also an important predictor for their future growth and development. The objective of this study was to identify possible factors associated with anemia among pre-school children in Bangladesh after removing a cluster effect of the population, and to determine the prevalence of this condition.MethodsData for this study was extracted from the 2011 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS-2011). In this survey, data was collected using a two-stage stratified cluster sampling approach. The chi-square test and a two-level logistic regression model were used for further analysis.ResultsData from 2231 children aged 6-59months were included for analysis. The prevalence of child anemia was noted to be 52.10%. Among these anemic children, 48.40% where from urban environment and 53.90% were from rural areas. The prevalence of mild, moderate and severe anemia among children was 57.10, 41.40 and 1.50% respectively. The two-level logistic regression model revealed that the following factors were associated with childhood anemia: children of anemic mothers (p<0.01), undernourished children (p<0.05), younger children (age<2years) (p<0.01) and children from poor family (p<0.05). Lastly, anemia was more common among children living in Barisal and Rangpur divisions compared to those from Dhaka division (p<0.01), and among non-Muslims than Muslim (p<0.05).ConclusionsOur study showed that prevalence of anemia among pre-school children in Bangladesh was very high (52.10%). We noted that young children of anemic mothers, from poor families, and being undernourished were at higher risk of developing anemia. Since most of these risk factors were related to socioeconomic conditions, they were potentially modifiable. Therefore, our findings may be useful for the health authorities to identify children at risk for remedial action and to plan for preventive measures.

AB Multidrug Transporters ( MDTs) are major contributors to the acquisition and maintenance of Antimicrobial Resistance ( AMR), a growing public health threat of broad concern. Despite the large number of MDTs, the overwhelming majority of the studies performed thus far in Gram-negative bacteria emphasize the supremacy of the AcrAB-TolC complex. To unveil the potential role of other MDTs we studied the behavior of a null AcrB Escherichia coli strain when challenged with chloramphenicol, a bacteriostatic antibiotic. We found that such a strain developed an extremely high-level of resistance to chloramphenicol, cross resistance to quinolones and erythromycin and displayed high levels of expression of the single component MFS transporter MdfA and multiple TolC-dependent transporters. The results suggest that the high versatility of the whole ensemble of transporters, the bacterial Effluxome, is an essential part of a strategy of survival in everchanging, at times noxious, environments. The concept of a functional Effluxome presents an alternative to the existing paradigms in the field and provides novel targets for the search for inhibitors of transporters as adjuvants of existing antibiotics.

TI The right to health as the basis for universal health coverage: A
   cross-national analysis of national medicines policies of 71 countries
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID DRUG POLICIES; ACCESS
AB Persistent barriers to universal access to medicines are limited social protection in the event of illness, inadequate financing for essential medicines, frequent stock-outs in the public sector, and high prices in the private sector. We argue that greater coherence between human rights law, national medicines policies, and universal health coverage schemes can address these barriers. We present a cross-national content analysis of national medicines policies from 71 countries published between 1990-2016. The World Health Organization's ( WHO) 2001 guidelines for developing and implementing a national medicines policy and all 71 national medicines policies were assessed on 12 principles, linking a health systems approach to essential medicines with international human rights law for medicines affordability and financing for vulnerable groups. National medicines policies most frequently contain measures for medicines selection and efficient spending/cost-effectiveness. Four principles ( legal right to health; government financing; efficient spending; and financial protection of vulnerable populations) are significantly stronger in national medicines policies published after 2004 than before. Six principles have remained weak or absent: pooling user contributions, international cooperation, and four principles for good governance. Overall, South Africa ( 1996), Indonesia and South Sudan ( 2006), Philippines ( 2011-2016), Malaysia ( 2012), Somalia ( 2013), Afghanistan ( 2014), and Uganda ( 2015) include the most relevant texts and can be used as models for other settings. We conclude that WHO's 2001 guidelines have guided the content and language of many subsequent national medicines policies. WHO and national policy makers can use these principles and the practical examples identified in our study to further align national medicines policies with human rights law and with Target 3.8 for universal access to essential medicines in the Sustainable Development Goals.

AB BackgroundTyphoid fever, caused by Salmonella Typhi, follows a fecal-oral transmission route and is a major global public health concern, especially in developing countries like Bangladesh. Increasing emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious issue; the list of treatments for typhoid fever is ever-decreasing. In addition to IncHI1-type plasmids, Salmonella genomic island (SGI) 11 has been reported to carry AMR genes. Although reports suggest a recent reduction in multidrug resistance (MDR) in the Indian subcontinent, the corresponding genomic changes in the background are unknown.ResultsHere, we assembled and annotated complete closed chromosomes and plasmids for 73S. Typhi isolates using short-length Illumina reads. S. Typhi had an open pan-genome, and the core genome was smaller than previously reported. Considering AMR genes, we identified five variants of SGI11, including the previously reported reference sequence. Five plasmids were identified, including the new plasmids pK91 and pK43; pK43and pHCM2 were not related to AMR. The pHCM1, pPRJEB21992 and pK91 plasmids carried AMR genes and, along with the SGI11 variants, were responsible for resistance phenotypes. pK91 also contained qnr genes, conferred high ciprofloxacin resistance and was related to the H58-sublineage Bdq, which shows the same phenotype. The presence of plasmids (pHCM1 and pK91) and SGI11 were linked to two H58-lineages, Ia and Bd. Loss of plasmids and integration of resistance genes in genomic islands could contribute to the fitness advantage of lineage Ia isolates.ConclusionsSuch events may explain why lineage Ia is globally widespread, while the Bd lineage is locally restricted. Further studies are required to understand how these S. Typhi AMR elements spread and generate new variants. Preventive measures such as vaccination programs should also be considered in endemic countries; such initiatives could potentially reduce the spread of AMR.

AB BackgroundIntussusception is a gastrointestinal condition in which early treatment is critical. Although its epidemiology and comorbidities have been studied, few studies have included the entire pediatric population of a country. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the epidemiologic features of pediatric intussusception patients and identify comorbidities associated with intussusception in South Korea, using the public health database.MethodsWe analyzed the data of children below 18years of age, from the national database of South Korea, who were diagnosed with intussusception and managed such as air reduction or surgical methods from 2008 to 2016. Patients were categorized into six groups based on the comorbid diseases. Patients with structural lesion in gastrointestinal tract were divided diagnosis or diagnosis code.ResultsThe number of patients diagnosed with intussusception were 25,023 (16,024 males, 64.0%). Of them, the highest percentage was patients aged between 2 and 36months (20,703; 82.7%). The incidence per 100,000 individuals aged up to 2years was 196.7. The number of males were 16,024 (64.0%) and were almost twice the number of 8999 (36.0%) female patients. The maximum number of cases (n=2517; 10.1%) were seen in September, followed by July (n=2469; 9.9%). In February, the number of cases was lowest at 1448 (5.8%) patients (P<0.001). The number of patients with structural lesions of the gastrointestinal tract that could lead to intussusception was 1207 (4.8%), while patients with acute gastrointestinal infectious disease were 4541 (18.1%). Among the structural lesions of the gastrointestinal tract that could be the leading cause of intussusception, lymphadenopathy was the most common, seen in 462 (56.6%) patients and an appendix-related condition was seen in 260 (31.9%) patients. Infectious diseases were more common in the younger children, while systemic diseases were more common in the older.ConclusionWe confirmed that pediatric intussusception in South Korea shows a seasonal tendency, which is age-dependent and is associated with an exposure to infectious agents. Some infectious pathogens and underlying diseases might play an important role in the pathophysiology of intussusception.

TI New ways of estimating excess mortality of chronic diseases from
   aggregated data: insights from the illness-death model
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH

   Dementia; Diabetes; Partial differential equation; Bayes estimation
ID PREVALENCE; AGE
AB Background: Recently, we have shown that the age-specific prevalence of a disease can be related to the transition rates in the illness-death model via a partial differential equation (PDE). The transition rates are the incidence rate, the remission rate and mortality rates from the 'Healthy' and 'Ill' states. In case of a chronic disease, we now demonstrate that the PDE can be used to estimate the excess mortality from age-specific prevalence and incidence data. For the prevalence and incidence, aggregated data are sufficient - no individual subject data are needed, which allows application of the methods in contexts of strong data protection or where data from individual subjects is not accessible.
   Methods: After developing novel estimators for the excess mortality derived from the PDE, we apply them to simulated data and compare the findings with the input values of the simulation aiming to evaluate the new approach. In a practical application to claims data from 35 million men insured by the German public health insurance funds, we estimate the population-wide excess mortality of men with diagnosed type 2 diabetes.
   Results: In the simulation study, we find that the estimation of the excess mortality is feasible from prevalence and incidence data if the prevalence is given at two points in time. The accuracy of the method decreases as the temporal difference between these two points in time increases. In our setting, the relative error was 5% and below if the temporal difference was three years or less. Application of the new method to the claims data yields plausible findings for the excess mortality of type 2 diabetes in German men.
   Conclusions: The described approach is useful to estimate the excess mortality of a chronic condition from aggregated age-specific incidence and prevalence data.

AB Background: Many children do not meet the recommended level of daily physical activity, even with the widely acknowledged health benefits associated with being physically active. There is a need to establish factors related to physical activity in children so that public health interventions may be appropriately designed. We investigated the association between Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), family expenditure on physical activity and objectively measured daily physical activity in 2-4-year-old children.
   Methods: Cross-sectional study with a sample of 81 UK preschool children taking part in the NAPSACC UK feasibility randomized controlled trial. Descriptive statistics are presented. We undertook Student t-tests to establish differences in physical activity by gender, age, parental education and nursery versus non-nursery days. Mixed effects linear regressions were used to model the association between minutes spent physically activity, minutes spent in moderate-to-vigorous (MVPA) physical activity and PedsQL scores (physical and psychosocial) and family expenditure on physical activity.
   Results: Most children (88.9%) did not engage in the recommended 180 min daily physical activity. There was mean (SD) of 141.9 (33.1) daily minutes of physically activity and 22.2 min per day (SD = 9.9) of MVPA. Boys and older children were more physically active. Children were more active on nursery days. There was no difference in physical activity by parental education. Half of the sample parents (50.6%) spent less than 9.00 pound weekly on their pre-schooler's physical activity. Children within the highest tertile of PedsQL physical functioning scores had higher levels of MVPA (3.6, 95% CI: -1.3-8.4, p-value 0.15), although confidence intervals crossed the null in the adjusted model. We found no evidence of an association between positive PedsQL psychosocial scores, or higher parental expenditure on physical activity, with the physical activity variables.
   Conclusions: Children in this sample were not meeting the recommended 180 min of daily physical activity. The 2-4-year-olds were most active on nursery days. There is no evidence of an association between better PedsQL physical scores and higher levels of MVPA. There was no evidence of an association between expenditure on physical activity and time spent physically active. Further examination in larger representative datasets is needed.

TI Turning conceptual systems maps into dynamic simulation models: An
   Australian case study for diabetes in pregnancy
SO PLOS ONE

   FRAMEWORK; MELLITUS; THINKING; POLICY; CLASSIFICATION; COMPLEXITY
AB Background
   System science approaches are increasingly used to explore complex public health problems. Quantitative methods, such as participatory dynamic simulation modelling, can mobilise knowledge to inform health policy decisions. However, the analytic and practical steps required to turn collaboratively developed, qualitative system maps into rigorous and policy-relevant quantified dynamic simulation models are not well described. This paper reports on the processes, interactions and decisions that occurred at the interface between modellers and end-user participants in an applied health sector case study focusing on diabetes in pregnancy.
   Methods
   An analysis was conducted using qualitative data from a participatory dynamic simulation modelling case study in an Australian health policy setting. Recordings of participatory model development workshops and subsequent meetings were analysed and triangulated with field notes and other written records of discussions and decisions. Case study vignettes were collated to illustrate the deliberations and decisions made throughout the model development process.
   Results
   The key analytic objectives and decision-making processes included: defining the model scope; analysing and refining the model structure to maximise local relevance and utility; reviewing and incorporating evidence to inform model parameters and assumptions; focusing the model on priority policy questions; communicating results and applying the models to policy processes. These stages did not occur sequentially; the model development was cyclical and iterative with decisions being re-visited and refined throughout the process. Storytelling was an effective strategy to both communicate and resolve concerns about the model logic and structure, and to communicate the outputs of the model to a broader audience.
   Conclusion
   The in-depth analysis reported here examined the application of participatory modelling methods to move beyond qualitative conceptual mapping to the development of a rigorously quantified and policy relevant, complex dynamic simulation model. The analytic objectives and decision-making themes identified provide guidance for interpreting, understanding and reporting future participatory modelling projects and methods.

AB Background
   Cervical cancer (CC) is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality among women from Paraguay, with high incidence and mortality rates (31.2 and 16 per 100 000 women, respectively). Although the risk factors associated with high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) infection and preneoplastic cervical lesions are widely studied, population-based characteristics of particular settings may influence the feasibility of HPV-based CC screening implementation. This study aimed to explore factors associated with hrHPV infection and high-grade cervical neoplasia in hrHPV-positive (hrHPV+) women from Paraguay.
   Methods
   A total of 5677 women aged 30-64 years from the Central Department of Paraguay were screened with HPV test (Hybrid Capture 2) and Pap smear. Sociodemographic and risk factor interviews were conducted. hrHPV+ women were referred to colposcopy and women with an abnormal colposcopy had a biopsy taken. The outcomes recorded were the hrHPV status and the presence of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or worse (CIN2+) among hrHPV+ women. Associations were investigated using multivariate logistic regressions.
   Results
   hrHPV prevalence was 13.8% (95% CI 13.0-14.8). This value decreased with the age of women (p-trend<0.001) and increased with the lifetime number of sexual partners (p-trend<0.001) and number of previous female partners of their current male partner if women had had one lifetime sexual partner (p-trend<0.001), increasing from 3.06 (95% CI 0.073-20.9) if partners had had one previous female partner to 9.19 (95% CI 2.36-61.1) if they had had eight or more. In hrHPV+ women, CIN2+ prevalence was 10.7% (95% CI 8.58-13.2) and increased with time since the last Pap smear (p-trend<0.001) and with the increasing number of pregnancies (p-trend = 0.05).
   Conclusion
   In these settings, the sexual behavior of women and their male partners is associated with hrHPV infection. In hrHPV+ women, underscreening practices and multiple pregnancies are associated with CIN2+. This knowledge can contribute to public health policies for CC prevention and control in Paraguay.

DT Article

AB Background
   Misuse of antibiotics is a well-known driver of antibiotic resistance. Given the decentralized model of the Indian health system and the shortage of allopathic doctors in rural areas, a wide variety of healthcare providers cater to the needs of patients in urban and rural settings. This qualitative study explores the drivers of antibiotic use among formal and informal healthcare providers as well as patients accessing care at primary health centers across Paschim Bardhaman district in West Bengal.
   Materials and methods
   We conducted 28 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with four groups of healthcare providers (allopathic doctors, informal health providers, nurses, and pharmacy shopkeepers) as well as patients accessing care at primary health centers and hospitals across Paschim Bardhaman district. Qualitative data was analyzed using the framework method in an inductive and deductive manner.
   Results
   Our results indicate that patients demand antibiotics from healthcare providers and seek the fastest cure possible, which influences the prescription choices of healthcare providers, particularly informal health providers. Many allopathic doctors provide antibiotics without any clinical indication due to inconsistent follow up, lack of testing facilities, risk of secondary infections, and unhygienic living conditions. Pharmaceutical company representatives actively network with informal health providers and formal healthcare providers alike, and regularly visit providers even in remote areas to market newer antibiotics. Allopathic doctors and informal health providers frequently blame the other party for being responsible for antibiotic resistance, and yet both display interdependence in referring patients to one another.
   Conclusions
   A holistic approach to curbing antibiotic resistance in West Bengal and other parts of India should focus on strengthening the capacity of the existing public health system to deliver on its promises, improving patient education and counseling, and including informal providers and pharmaceutical company representatives in community-level antibiotic stewardship efforts.

TI Demand and level of service inflation in Floating Catchment Area (FCA)
   methods
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MEASURING SPATIAL ACCESSIBILITY; PRIMARY-HEALTH-CARE; ACCESS
AB Floating Catchment Area (FCA) methods are a popular tool to investigate accessibility to public facilities, in particular health care services. FCA approaches are attractive because, unlike other accessibility measures, they take into account the potential for congestion of facilities. This is done by 1) considering the population within the catchment area of a facility to calculate a variable that measures level of service, and then 2) aggregating the level of service by population centers subject to catchment area constraints. In this paper we discuss an effect of FCA approaches, an artifact that we term demand and level of service inflation. These artifacts are present in previous implementations of FCA methods. We argue that inflation makes interpretation of estimates of accessibility difficult, which has possible deleterious consequences for decision making. Next, we propose a simple and intuitive approach to proportionally allocate demandand and level of service in FCA calculations. The approach is based on a standardization of the impedance matrix, similar to approaches popular in the spatial statistics and econometrics literature. The result is a more intiuitive measure of accessibility that 1) provides a local version of the provider-to-population ratio; and 2) preserves the level of demand and the level of supply in a system. We illustrate the relevant issues with some examples, and then empirically by means of a case study of accessibility to family physicians in the Hamilton Census Metropolitan Area (CMA), in Ontario, Canada. Results indicate that demand and supply inflation/deflation affect the interpretation of accessibility analysis using existing FCA methods, and that the proposed adjustment can lead to more intuitive results.

   TAILINGS; NAILS; INGESTION; TRACE
AB Uranium (U) measurements in water, soil, and food related to gold mining activities in populated areas in Gauteng Province, South Africa, suggest the possibility of exposure levels that may lead to adverse health consequences, including cancer. Theoretical considerations on pathways of human uptake of significant exposures are plausible, but few data on directly measured human exposure are available. A cross-sectional study was conducted using human measurements to compare U levels with other settings around the globe (based on literature review), to explore potential exposure variability within the province, and to test the feasibility of recruiting subjects partially coming from vulnerable and difficult-to-reach populations. Wards of potentially high (HE) and low exposure (LE) were identified. Composite hair samples representing the respective local populations were collected from regular customers of selected barber shops over a period of 1-2 months. A total of 70 U concentrations were determined in 27 composite samples from 1332 individuals. U concentrations ranged from 31 mu g/kg to 2524 mu g/kg, with an arithmetic mean of 192 mu g/kg (standard deviation, 310 mu g/kg) and a median of 122 mu g/kg. Although HE wards collectively showed higher U levels than LE wards (184 vs 134 mu g/kg), differences were smaller than expected. In conclusion, detected U levels were higher than those from most other surveys of the general public. The barber-based approach was an efficient hair collection approach. Composite hair samples are not recommended, due to technical challenges in measuring U, and individual hair samples are needed in follow-up studies to determine predictors of exposure.

AB BackgroundCommissioning and monitoring of community-based interventions is a challenge due to the complex nature of the environment and the lack of any explicit cut-offs to guide decision making. At what point, for example, is participant enrolment to interventions, course completion or satisfaction deemed to be acceptable or sufficient for continued funding? We aimed to identify and quantify key progression criteria for fourteen early years interventions by (1) agreeing the top three criteria for monitoring of successful implementation and progress; and (2) agreeing boundaries to categorise interventions as meeting anticipated target' (green); falling short of targets' (amber) and targets not being met' (red).MethodsWe ran three workshops in partnership with the UK's Big Lottery Fund commissioned programme Better Start Bradford' (implementing more than 20 interventions to improve the health, wellbeing and development of children aged 0-3) to support decision making by agreeing progression criteria for the interventions being delivered. Workshops included 72 participants, representing a range of professional groups including intervention delivery teams, commissioners, intervention-monitoring teams, academics and community representatives. After discussion and activities, final decisions were submitted using electronic voting devices. All participants were invited to reconsider their responses via a post-workshop questionnaire.ResultsThree key progression criteria were assigned to each of the 14 interventions. Overall, criteria that participants most commonly voted for were recruitment, implementation and reach, but these differed according to each intervention. Cut-off values used to indicate when an intervention moved to red' varied by criteria; the lowest being for recruitment, where participants agreed that meeting less than 65% of the targeted recruitment would be deemed as red' (falling short of target).ConclusionsOur methodology for monitoring the progression of interventions has resulted in a clear pathway which will support commissioners and intervention teams in local decision making within the Better Start Bradford programme and beyond. This work can support others wishing to implement a formal system for monitoring the progression of public health interventions.

TI Factors influencing the attention to home storage of medicines in China
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Medicine; Home medicine storage; Storage condition; China
ID MEDICATION MANAGEMENT
AB BackgroundMedicines are stored in most households around the world for a range of different purposes including emergency use and the treatment of acute or chronic illnesses. The presence of medicines in households is becoming a significant risk factor for irrational medicine storage, disposal, and use in developing countries due to limited information and knowledge offered on safe storage. This study examined how patients store medicines and highlighted factors which influence home storage behaviours for medicines in China.MethodA cross-sectional survey of 625 households was undertaken. In each household, data were collected from the head of household present at home. The study covered six provinces in China including the North, Central, and Southern regions. Respondents were interviewed by doctors. The doctors were study assistants and data collectors. Attention was taken as the research focus and a five-point Likert scale was used to measure attitudes to medicine storage at home. Factor analysis, variance analysis, and the multivariable logistic regression models were employed in the present study.ResultsOf the households investigated in this study, cold medications were the medicine most commonly stored at home. The majority of the respondents gave more attention to the expiration date of medicines compared to other factors. Only a few respondents thought humidity was important factor influencing home storage of medicines. Despite some attention being given to the location of storage for home medicines, considerably more information is needed to improve awareness. In addition, our data revealed that some attention had been paid to elimination and recycling mechanisms but similarly, increased awareness is needed. There were obvious differences between the populations used in the study, due to differences in socio-demographic characteristics of the study participants. Age is the most important factor influencing the attention paid to home storage of medicines in China.ConclusionA major improvement in the awareness of correct storage conditions of medicines for home use can be realized by increased education, and highlighting the importance of correct medicine storage, disposal methods and usages, which has high potential to deliver public health benefits in China. Some suggestions were provided to health care providers.

TI Contextual determinants of CHILDREN'S health care and policy in Europe
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Context; Health policy; Contextual determinants; Policy drivers
AB BackgroundThe main objective of this study was to explore the contextual determinants of child health policies.MethodsThe Horizon 2020 Models of Child Health Appraised (MOCHA) project has one Country Agent (CA) in all 30 EU and EEA countries. A questionnaire designed by MOCHA researchers as a semi-structured survey instrument asked CAs to identify and report the predominating public and professional discussions related to child health services within the last 5years in their country and the various factors which may have influenced these. The survey was issued to CAs following validation by an independent Expert Advisory Board. The data were collected between July and December 2016.The data was qualitatively analysed using software Nvivo11 for data coding and categorization and constructing the scheme for identified processes or elements.ResultsContextual determinants of children's health care and policy were grouped into four categories. 1) Socio-cultural determinants: societal activation, awareness, communication, trust, freedom, contextual change, lifestyle, tolerance and religion, and history. 2) Structural determinants which were divided into: a) external determinants related to elements indirectly correlated with health care and b) internal determinants comprising interdependent health care and policy processes. 3) International determinants such as cross-nationality of child health policy issues. 4) The specific situational determinants: events which contributed to intensification of debates which were reflected by behavioural, procedural, institutional and global factors.ConclusionsThe influence of context across European countries, in the process of children's health policy development is clearly evident from our research. A number of key categories of determinants which influence child health policy have been identified and can be used to describe this context. Child health policy is often initiated in reaction to public discontentment. The multiple voices of society resulted, amongst others, in the introduction of new procedures, action plans and guidelines; raising levels of awareness, intensifying public scrutiny, increasing access and availability of services and provoking introduction of structural changes or withdrawing unfavourable changes.

AB BackgroundIn a context of increasing use of Nucleic Acid Amplification Test, diagnoses of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis infections among men increased in Europe and USA since 2007. We aimed to describe trends in the incidence of male urethritis in France between 2007 and 2017.MethodsWe analysed male urethritis clinical cases reported by the French GPs' Sentinelles network.ResultsGPs reported 1944 cases of male urethritis during the study period. The estimated annual incidence rates in men aged 15years and older remained stable between 226 cases per 100,000 seen in 2007 and 196 in 2017 (P value=0.9). A third-generation cephalosporin with macrolide or tetracycline was prescribed in 17.5% of cases in 2009 (27/154) and 32.4% in 2017 (47/145) (P value=0.0327).ConclusionsThe incidence rates for adult male urethritis diagnosed in primary care have remained stable since 2007 in France in contrast with the increasing trend of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis infections based on microbiological surveillance. Using stable clinical definition for male urethritis seems essential to follow correctly epidemiological dynamic.

AB Background: Both depressive disorder and subclinical depressive symptoms during adolescence are a major public health concern. Therefore, it is important that depression is detected at an early stage and is treated preventively. Prevention based on the principles of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) has proven to be the most effective, however research has mainly focused on the effectiveness of "prevention packages" consisting of multiple CBT-components, rather than on the distinct CBT-components. This study will evaluate the relative effectiveness of four core components of CBT (cognitive restructuring (CR), behavioural activation (BA), problem solving (PS) and relaxation (RE)). In addition the relative (cost-)effectiveness of four different sequences of these components will be evaluated: (1) CR - BA - RE - PS, (2) BA - CR - RE - PS, (3) PS - GA - CR - RE and (4) RE - PS - BA - CR.
   Methods: We will perform a non-blinded multisite cluster randomized prevention microtrial with four parallel conditions consisting of the four sequences. The four sequences of components will be offered in groups of high school students with elevated depressive symptoms. For each CBT-component a module of three sessions is developed. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, after each CBT-component, prior to each session, at post-intervention and at 6-month follow-up. Potential moderators and mediators will be evaluated exploratively to shed light on for whom the (sequences of) CBT-components are most effective and how effects are mediated.
   Discussion: The potential value of the study is insight in the relative effectiveness of the four most commonly used CBT-components and four different sequences, and possible moderators and mediators in the prevention of depression among adolescents. This knowledge can be used to optimize and personalize CBT-programs.

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID RESPIRATORY-TRACT INFECTIONS; PRESCRIBING PATTERNS; PRESCRIPTION
AB Purpose
   Overuse and misuse of antibiotics are the primary risk factors for antibiotics resistance. Inadequate professional competence of primary care physicians might exacerbate these problems in China. This retrospective study aims to document the clinical pattern of antibiotics use and its overuse and misuse rates in rural primary care institutions and to evaluate the association between antibiotics use and characteristics of physicians and their patients.
   Methods
   Medical records from 16 primary care hospitals in rural areas of Guizhou province, China were obtained from the Health Information System in 2018. Classification of unnecessary use, incorrect spectrum of antibiotic, escalated use of extended spectrum and combined antibiotics use was based on the Guiding Principle of Clinical Use of Antibiotics (2015, China) and guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Generalized Estimating Equations were employed to determine predictive factors for inappropriate antibiotics use.
   Results
   A total of 74,648 antibiotics prescriptions were retrieved. Uncomplicated respiratory infection was the most common disease accounting for 58.6% of all prescriptions. The main antibiotic group used was penicillins (51.5%) followed by cephalosporins and macrolides (14% each). Of 57,009 patient visits, only 8.7% of the antibiotic prescriptions were appropriate. Combined use, escalated use of extended spectrum antibiotics, incorrect spectrum and unnecessary antibiotics use was found in 7.8%, 1.9%, 4.3% and 77.3% of patient visits, respectively, of which 28.7% were given intravenously. Antibiotics misuse was significantly more likely among newly employed physicians with lower levels of professional education. Adult patients and those who had public insurance had a higher risk of being prescribed unnecessary antibiotics.
   Conclusion
   Overuse of antibiotics for uncomplicated respiratory infection and use of cephalosporins, macrolides and injection antibiotics in primary care are the major problems of clinical practice in rural areas of Guizhou.

AB Carbapenemase-producing bacteria (CPB) are rare, multidrug resistant organisms most commonly associated with hospitalized patients. Metropolitan wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) treat wastewater from large geographic areas which include hospitals and may serve as epidemiologic reservoirs for the maintenance or expansion of CPB that originate from hospitals and are ultimately discharged in treated effluent. However, little is known about the potential impact of these WWTP CPB on the local surface water and their risk to the public health. In addition, CPB that are present in surface water may ultimately disseminate to intensively-managed animal agriculture facilities where there is potential for amplification by extended-spectrum cephalosporins. To better understand the role of WWTPs in the dissemination of CPB in surface waters, we obtained samples of treated effluent, and both upstream and downstream nearby surface water from 50 WWTPs throughout the US. A total of 30 CPB with clinically-relevant genotypes were recovered from 15 WWTPs (30%) of which 13 (50%) serviced large metropolitan areas and 2 (8.3%) represented small rural populations (P < 0.05). Recovery of CPB was lowest among WWTPs that utilized ultraviolet radiation for primary disinfection (12%), and higher (P = 0.11) for WWTPs that used chlorination (42%) or that did not utilize disinfection (50%). We did not detect a difference in CPB recovery by sampling site, although fewer CPB were detected in upstream (8%) compared to effluent (20%) and downstream (18%) samples. Our results indicate that WWTP effluent and nearby surface waters in the US are routinely contaminated with CPB with clinically important genotypes including those producing Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) and New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM). This is a concern for both public health and animal agriculture because introduction of CPB into intensively managed livestock populations could lead to their amplification and foodborne dissemination.

TI Hepatitis A virus seroprevalence in South Africa - Estimates using
   routine laboratory data, 2005-2015
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID EPIDEMIOLOGY; VACCINATION; INFECTION
AB Introduction
   South Africa is considered highly endemic for hepatitis A virus (HAV) although few seroprevalence studies have been conducted over the past two decades. The World Health Organization recommends integrating HAV vaccination into national childhood immunization schedules where there is transition from high to intermediate endemicity. As a means of gauging age-specific rates of infection, we report HAV seroprevalence rates among specimens tested for HAV serology within South Africas public health sector from 2005-2015.
   Materials and methods
   Hepatitis A serology results (Anti-HAV IgM, IgG and total antibody) from 2005-2015 were extracted from South Africas National Health Laboratory Services Corporate Data Warehouse (NHLS CDW), the central data repository of all laboratory test-sets within the public health sector. Results were extracted according to test-set, result, date of testing, health facility, name, surname, age, and sex. Anti-HAV IgG results were merged with total antibody results to reflect anti-HAV seroprevalence. Testing volume, positivity rates and age-specific anti-HAV seroprevalence rates by year and geographic distribution are described.
   Results and discussion
   A total of 501 083 HAV IgM results were retrieved, of which 16 423 (3.3%) were positive, 484 259 (96.6%) negative and 401 (0.1%) equivocal; and 34 710 HAV total antibody/IgG tests of which 30 675 (88.4%) were positive, 4 020 (11.6%) negative and 15 equivocal. Whereas IgM positivity was highest among the 1-4 year age group (33.5%) and lowest among patients >45 years (<0.5%), total antibody positivity ranged from its lowest level of 52.7% in the 1-4 year age group increasing to levels of >90% only after 25 years of age.
   Conclusion
   Anti-HAV total antibody testing within the South African public health sector demonstrates seroprevalence rates reach levels >90% only in adulthood, suggesting South Africa could be in transition from high to intermediate endemicity. Prospective studies with geographically representative sampling are required to confirm these findings and evaluate provincial and urban/rural heterogeneity.

ID DRUG POLICY; PATH DEPENDENCE; LEGAL HIGHS; CONVERGENCE
AB Introduction
   The rapid rise in trade and use of NPS and the lack of information concerning their potential toxicity pose serious challenges to public health authorities across the world. Policy measures towards NPS taken so far have a special focus on their legal status, while the implementation of a public health strategy seems to be still missing. The aim of this study is to perform a general assessment of NPS-related policy (including regulatory measures and public health strategies) implemented by six European countries: Portugal, the Netherlands, Czech Republic, Poland, the United Kingdom and Sweden.
   Methods
   Six EU countries were included in this scoping review study. Drug policies (including legal responses and public health strategies) were analysed. UNODC drug policy classification system was used as a benchmark, while path dependency approach was used for data analysis; a net of inter-dependencies between international, EU and national policies was highlighted.
   Results and discussion
   The countries included in this study can be placed in a wide spectrum according to their formulation of drug policy, from Portugal and the UK that have specific legal responses to NPS but have differently focused on harm reduction strategies at one end, to Sweden whose drug-free society goal is not translated into a specific regulation of NPS at the other end.
   Conclusion
   The findings of the study reveal limited development towards harmonisation of national drug policies particularly with regard to NPS. To tackle the challenge presented by NPS, EU Member states have formulated legislation and public health strategies independently. National approaches to NPS are therefore in line with their already existing drug policies, reflecting cultural values towards substance abuse and national political interests, while the homogenization at an international level has so far mostly been focused on law enforcement and drugs use preventive strategies.

TI Evaluating the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of dapivirine
   vaginal ring pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   Expanded HIV prevention options are needed to increase uptake of HIV prevention among women, especially in generalized epidemics. As the dapivirine vaginal ring moves forward through regulatory review and open-label extension studies, the potential public health impact and cost-effectiveness of this new prevention method are not fully known. We used mathematical modeling to explore the impact and cost-effectiveness of the ring in different implementation scenarios alongside scale-up of other HIV prevention interventions. Given the knowledge gaps about key factors influencing the ring's implementation, including potential uptake and delivery costs, we engaged in a stakeholder consultation process to elicit plausible parameter ranges and explored scenarios to identify the possible range of impact, cost, and cost-effectiveness.
   Methods and findings
   We used the Goals model to simulate scenarios of oral and ring pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) implementation among female sex workers and among other women <= 21 years or >21 years with multiple male partners, in Kenya, South Africa, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. In these scenarios, we varied antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage, dapivirine ring coverage and ring effectiveness (encompassing efficacy and adherence) by risk group. Following discussions with stakeholders, the maximum level of PrEP coverage (oral and/or ring) considered in each country was equal to modern contraception use minus condom use in the two age groups.
   We assessed results for 18 years, from 2018 to 2035. In South Africa, for example, the HIV infections averted by PrEP (ring plus oral PrEP) ranged from 310,000 under the highest-impact scenario (including ART held constant at 2017 levels, high ring coverage, and 85% ring effectiveness) to 55,000 under the lowest-impact scenario (including ART reaching the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets by 2020, low ring coverage, and 30% ring effectiveness). This represented a range of 6.4% to 2.2% of new HIV infections averted. Given our assumptions, the addition of the ring results in 11% to 132% more impact than oral PrEP alone. The cost per HIV infection averted for the ring ranged from US$13,000 to US$121,000.
   Conclusions
   This analysis offers a wide range of scenarios given the considerable uncertainty over ring uptake, consistency of use, and effectiveness, as well as HIV testing, prevention, and treatment use over the next two decades. This could help inform donors and implementers as they decide where to allocate resources in order to maximize the impact of the dapivirine ring in light of funding and implementation constraints. Better understanding of the cost and potential uptake of the intervention would improve our ability to estimate its cost-effectiveness and assess where it can have the most impact.

AB BackgroundThe antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal periods are considered high-risk periods for the health of mothers and their newborns. Although the current utilization rate of some maternal and child care services in Jordan is encouraging, detailed information about the quality of these services is limited. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the quality of maternal-fetal and newborn antenatal care (ANC), delivery, and postnatal care (PNC) services in Jordan.MethodsWe conducted 12 focus group discussions (FGDs) with pregnant and postpartum women who attended maternal-child care services in three major hospitals in Jordan. All FGDs were recorded and transcribed verbatim. An inductive thematic analysis approach was used to identify themes and subthemes.ResultsThe content analysis of the FGDs revealed a consensus among the discussants regarding the importance of ANC and PNC services for the health of mothers and their newborns. However, the participating women viewed ANC to be much more important than PNC. With regards to the choice between public and private antenatal care services, some of the discussants were disposed towards the private sector. Reasons for this included longer consultation time, a higher quality of services, better interpersonal and communication skills of healthcare providers, better treatment, more advanced equipment and devices, availability of female obstetricians, and more flexible appointment times. These women only perceived public hospital services to be necessary in cases of pregnancy-related complications and labor, as the costs of private sector services in such cases are too high. The findings also revealed that mothers usually only seek PNC services to check up on their newborn's health and not their own.ConclusionVisiting private ANC clinics throughout pregnancy while giving birth in public facilities leads to the discontinuity and fragmentation in maternal-fetal and child healthcare services. To address this fragmentation, healthcare systems are proposed to establish interprofessional teamwork that requires different healthcare providers with complementary skills and practices in both public and private settings to work co-operatively and collectively. Investment in new technologies and interventions which enhance coordination and collaboration between public and private healthcare settings is necessary for the provision of non-traditional maternal healthcare.

AB BackgroundTraumatic events can trigger postpartum depression. Pregnant women in Brazil today are facing an extremely stressful experience. Thus, the objective here was to analyze the prevalence of symptoms of depression in the immediate postpartum period (IPPD) and associate these symptoms with previous stressful, social, psychological, behavioral, obstetrical, clinical, violent and infectious events, particularly exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy.MethodsThis was a case-control study. The sample comprised 213 puerperal women treated in the maternity ward of a public reference hospital in the Araguaia River Valley of Mato Grosso and Goias, Brazil. Severe IPPD symptoms were confirmed based on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). A descriptive statistical analysis was carried out using the Epi Info version 7.1.5 suite of software tools and the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21.0.ResultsA bivariate analysis revealed a significant association between severe symptoms of IPPD and the following variables: clinical diagnosis of ZIKV during pregnancy (OR=13.36; 95% CI=5.34-33.39); was separated or divorced in the last year (OR=3.58; 95% CI=1.42-8.99); suffered an accident in the last year (OR=3.32, 95% CI=1.12-9.82); suffered emotional violence during pregnancy (OR=3.80; 95% CI=1.81-7.99); suffered physical violence during pregnancy (OR=11.86; 95% CI=2.07-67.82); fear of her partner (OR=17.90; 95% CI=3.44-92.99); dengue fever during pregnancy (OR=7.85; 95% CI: 1.66-37.05), and has a family member diagnosed with mental illness (OR=2.54; 95% CI=1.09-5.93). The multivariate analysis confirmed the association of severe PPD symptoms only with the variables of clinical diagnosis of ZIKV during pregnancy (OR=19.82; 95% CI: 5.35-73.39) and was separated or divorced in the last year (OR=3.92; 95% IC=1.12-13.63).ConclusionsClinically diagnosed ZIKV during pregnancy may be one of the main events associated with severe IPPD symptoms, showing an almost 20-fold higher chance of occurrence than other factors.

AB BackgroundInternational sustainable development goals for the elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health problem by 2030 highlight the need to optimize strategies for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. An important priority for Africa is to have affordable, accessible and sustainable prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) programmes, delivering screening and treatment for antenatal women and implementing timely administration of HBV vaccine for their babies.MethodsWe developed a decision-analytic model simulating 10,000 singleton pregnancies to assess the cost-effectiveness of three possible strategies for deployment of tenofovir in pregnancy, in combination with routine infant vaccination: S1: no screening nor antiviral therapy; S2: screening and antiviral prophylaxis for all women who test HBsAg-positive; S3: screening for HBsAg, followed by HBeAg testing and antiviral prophylaxis for women who are HBsAg-positive and HBeAg-positive. Our outcome was cost per infant HBV infection avoided and the analysis followed a healthcare perspective.ResultsBased on 10,000 pregnancies, S1 predicts 45 infants would be HBV-infected at six months of age, compared to 21 and 28 infants in S2 and S3, respectively. Relative to S1, S2 had an incremental cost of $3940 per infection avoided. S3 led to more infections and higher costs.ConclusionGiven the long-term health burden for individuals and economic burden for society associated with chronic HBV infection, screening pregnant women and providing tenofovir for all who test HBsAg+ may be a cost-effective strategy for South Africa and other low/middle income settings.

AB BackgroundReducing maternal mortality remains a global priority. In 2000, the United Nations Member States pledged to work towards a series of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), in which the fifth target was to reduce maternal mortality ratio by 75% from 1990 to 2015. The Chinese government introduced Basic Public Health Service project in 2009 to the further improvement of maternal health services and reduction in maternal mortality. China had achieved the goal of MDG5 1 year ahead of the schedule in 2014, but the effects of the project on reducing maternal mortality were rarely evaluated with robust methods.MethodsWe conducted a longitudinal study on maternal mortality ratio by extracting mortality data from the National Maternal Mortality Surveillance System (1991-2016) and maternal health services measures from the China health statistic yearbook (2001-2016). We utilized the segmented linear regression model to assess changes and trends of maternal mortality ratio and maternal health services before and after the introduction of Basic Public Health Service project. Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to measure the strength of association between the maternal mortality ratio and maternal health services.ResultsThe yearly trend change of national maternal mortality ratio was -1.76 (p<0.01) after the introduction of Basic Public Health Service project in 2009, while the yearly trend change of maternal health record establish rate, prenatal examination rate, postpartum visit rate was 0.77 (p<0.01), 0.61 (p<0.01) and 0.83 (p<0.01) separately. The negative correlations were also found between national maternal mortality ratio and prenatal examination rate (r=-0.95, p<0.01), maternal health record establish rate (r=-0.93, p<0.01) and postpartum visit rate (r=-0.92, p<0.01).ConclusionsThe Basic Public Health Service project was found to be associated with the improvements in the maternal health services and reduction in maternal mortality. The design and implementation of the project may serve as a positive example for other developing countries. Continued monitoring and assessment of project effects should be stressed.

AB Objective
   While the major policy changes in the Indonesian healthcare system over the last 25 years have been well documented, less is known about the accompanying changes in inequalities in healthcare utilisation during this period. Our study aimed to describe the trends in income-related inequalities in healthcare utilisation in Indonesia during the period 1993-2014.
   Methods
   A repeated cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the Indonesian Family Life Surveys from 1993, 2000, 2007, and 2014. We measured outpatient and inpatient healthcare utilisation in public and private provider as well as the overall utilisation. Standardised prevalence rate and relative index of inequality (RII) were used to measure the extent of inequalities in healthcare utilisation by income level (income-related inequalities).
   Results
   Relatively large income-related inequalities were observed in the utilisation of private outpatient care and public and private inpatient care in 1993. Income-related inequalities in public and private outpatient care utilisation decreased between 1993 and 2007 but increased in 2014. Income-related inequalities in public and private inpatient care utilisation continued to decrease between 1993 and 2014. The largest decrease was observed in private inpatient care utilisation.
   Conclusion
   Income-related inequalities in all types of healthcare utilisation decreased until 2007. This trend continued until 2014 only for public and private inpatient care utilisation. This phenomenon may be explained by the changes to the healthcare system (e.g. expansion of the government health insurance programme and health sector decentralisation), which coincided with the changes in inequalities in healthcare utilisation in Indonesia.

   ASSOCIATION; BURDEN; IMPACT; ADULTS; TRIAL
AB Background
   In 2017, more than 1.1 million children were living with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) globally. The goal in paediatric diabetes therapy is reaching optimal glycaemic control as early as possible in order to avoid complications and early mortality without compromising the quality of life (QoL) of children. Several different insulin regimens are available for T1DM patients to reach this goal.
   Aims
   This review set out to analyse whether continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) regimens are superior to multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy in T1DM youth regarding QoL. Additionally, it assessed glycaemic control and adverse events as secondary outcomes and discussed potential future public health implications and justifications for using CSII as a first-line therapy in diabetic youth.
   Methods
   A systematic review and random effects meta-analysis was performed on studies investigating the association between QoL and diabetes treatment regimen. Differences in adverse event rates between groups were analysed using a Mann-Whitney U test. Lastly, differences in glycaemic control were assessed using a random effects meta-analysis.
   Results
   QoL and glycaemic control was significantly better in CSII subjects at baseline and follow-up. No significant differences in adverse events were found between study groups. No significant changes over time could be shown for either QoL or glycaemic control.
   Conclusion
   CSII proved to provide similar or slightly better outcomes in all analysed fields. This is consistent with previous research. However, to make credible recommendations, better-designed studies are needed to investigate the impact of CSII in children.

AB Background
   Nepal has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the South Asia region, partly due to the underutilization of maternal health services and the high number of adolescent pregnancies. This study explores married Nepali adolescent girls' healthcare-seeking behaviour throughout their pregnancies, during their delivery and postpartum.
   Methods
   We conducted a prospective qualitative study in Banke district, Nepal. In-depth interviews were conducted with 27 married adolescent girls before and after delivery. In addition, a focus group discussion was conducted with community health works and key-informant interviews were conducted with family members of adolescent girls, representatives from the government and health care providers. We applied the Social-Ecological Model (SEM) as a framework to guide thematic content analysis and presentation of our qualitative data.
   Results
   Several factors in the SEM influenced maternal health care-seeking behaviour of adolescents. At the individual level, girls' perceptions, their lack of knowledge about maternal and reproductive health, certain traditional practices, their sole dependency on their husbands and mothers-in-laws and their low decision-making autonomy towards their own health care negatively influenced their utilization of skilled maternal health services. Mothers-in-law and other family members played a critical role in either encouraging or discouraging the use of skilled maternal health services. At the health systems level, lack of adolescent-friendly maternal health services, difficulties in accessing quality maternal health services, and the fixed operating hours of public health facilities restricted their ability to obtain services. The existence of the Safe Motherhood Programme, knowledge sharing platforms such as "women's groups" and the active role of Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs) positively influenced utilization of skilled maternal health services among these girls.
   Conclusion
   Influences on married adolescent girls' use of skilled maternal health services in Banke District, Nepal were multi-factoral. Ensuring easy access and availability of adolescent-friendly maternal health services are important to encourage adolescent girls to use skilled maternal health services. Moreover, interventions are needed to improve adolescent girls' knowledge of maternal health, keep them in school, involve family members (mainly mothers-in-law) in health interventions, as well as overcome negative traditional beliefs within the community that discourage care-seeking for skilled maternal health services.

AB BackgroundUndernutrition among school age children has an impact on their health, cognition, and educational achievement. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of stunting and wasting among school age children in Gondar town, northwest, Ethiopia.MethodsAn institution-based cross-sectional study was done among school children aged 6-14years. Data on socio-demographic, nutritional and dietary status of children were collected using structured questionnaire. Anthropometric measurements were carried out to determine the status of stunting and wasting. Data were entered into Epi-Info version 3.5.3 and transferred to SPSS version 20 for further analysis. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to identify associated factors of stunting and wasting. Both crude odds and adjusted odds ratios with 95% CI were used to measure the strength of associations. In the multivariable analysis, variables with <0.05 p-values were considered statistically significant.ResultsA total of 523 school age children were with the median age of 12 (10-13 inter quartile range) years participated in the study. The overall prevalence of stunting and wasting among primary school children was 241(46.1%; 95% CI: 42.3, 50.3) and 47 (9%; 95% CI: 6.7, 11.7), respectively. Child age (AOR=1.9, 95% CI: 1.29, 2.80), public tab/yard water source (AOR=2.22; 95%CI: 1.46, 3.39), DDS<4 (AOR=1.89 95%CI: 1.08, 3.30), tea drinking habit (AOR=0.46, 95%CI: 0.27, 0.80) and anemia (AOR=1.72 95%CI: 1.05, 2.83) were significant predictors of stunting. Moreover, child age (AOR=3.91; 95% CI: 1.62, 9.44), maternal/care-givers' age34 (AOR=0.34; 95%CI: 0.16, 0.71), maternal education (AOR=2.55; 95%CI: 1.15, 5.65), family poverty (AOR=3.23; 95% CI: 1.30, 7.93) and alcohol consumption (AOR=2.93; 95%CI: 1.16, 7.42) were found significantly associated with wasting.ConclusionStunting and wasting were then major problems among school age children. Child age, water source for dinking, DDS<4 and anemia resulted in stunting. On the other hand, child age, maternal education and age, family poverty and alcohol drinking were risk factors for wasting. Therefore, launching community based nutritional education programs, implementing school feeding and strengthening economic level of the communities are essential to reduce the problems.

AB BackgroundPhlebotomine sand flies (Diptera, Nematocera) are important vectors of several pathogens, including Leishmania parasites, causing serious diseases of humans and dogs. Despite their importance as disease vectors, most aspects of sand fly biology remain unknown including the molecular basis of their reproduction and sex determination, aspects also relevant for the development of novel vector control strategies.ResultsUsing comparative genomics/transcriptomics data mining and transcriptional profiling, we identified the sex determining genes in phlebotomine sand flies and proposed the first model for the sex determination cascade of these insects. For all the genes identified, we produced manually curated gene models, developmental gene expression profile and performed evolutionary molecular analysis. We identified and characterized, for the first time in a Nematocera species, the transformer (tra) homolog which exhibits both conserved and novel features. The analysis of the tra locus in sand flies and its expression pattern suggest that this gene is able to autoregulate its own splicing, as observed in the fruit fly Ceratitis capitata and several other insect species.ConclusionsOur results permit to fill the gap about sex determination in sand flies, contribute to a better understanding of this developmental pathway in Nematocera and open the way for the identification of sex determining orthologs in other species of this important Diptera sub-order. Furthermore, the sex determination genes identified in our work also provide the opportunity of future biotechnological applications to control natural population of sand flies, reducing their impact on public health.

AB BackgroundClient-centric quality of care (QoC) in family planning (FP) services are imperative for contraceptive method adoption and continuation. Less is known about the choice of contraceptive method in India beyond responses to the three common questions regarding method information, asked in demographic and health surveys. This study argues for appropriate measurement of method choice and assesses its levels and correlates in rural India.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted with new acceptors of family planning method (N=454) recruited from public and private health facilities in rural Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, the two most populous states in India. The key quality of care indicator method choice' was assessed using four key questions from client-provider interactions that help in making a choice about a particular method: (1) whether the provider asked the client about their preferred method, (2) whether the provider told the client about at least one additional method, (3) whether the client received information without any single method being promoted by the provider, and (4) client's perception about receipt of method choice. The definition of method choice in this study included women who responded yes to all four questions in the survey. The relationship between contraceptive communication and receipt of method choice was assessed using logistic regression analyses, after adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents.ResultsAlthough 62% of clients responded to a global question and reported that they received the method of their choice, only 28% received it based on responses about client-provider interactions. Receipt of the information on side-effects of the selected method (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]: 7.4, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 3.96-13.86) and facility readiness to provide a range of contraceptive choice (AOR: 2.67, 95% CI: 1.48-4.83) were significantly associated with receipt of method choice.ConclusionsFindings demonstrated that women's choice of contraceptive could be improved in rural India if providers give full information prior to and during the acceptance of a method and if facilities are equipped to provide a range of choice of contraceptive methods.

AB BackgroundUser satisfaction represents a patient-centered measure that should be used to assess the quality of oral health services. This study investigated the differences in user satisfaction with public oral health services according to the sociodemographic user profile and the quality of oral health services in primary health care in Brazil.MethodsSecondary data from a national program obtained through interviews with users were analyzed. Satisfaction was based on the Swan' model relating to perceptions regarding the service performance, assessment of overall satisfaction and the intention to avoid the service in the future. The exploratory variables were demographic characteristics of the users and the quality of the primary service from the user's viewpoint, considering the dimensions: access; receptivity of spontaneous demand; integral health care; bonding, accountability, and coordination of care.ResultsA total of 37,262 users participated, and 65.51% reported satisfaction with the oral health service, that was higher among those >20years old and beneficiaries of the Family Grant Program and lower among users with a higher level of schooling and those who reported being employed. Users who rated oral health service positively were more satisfied.ConclusionsSocioeconomically disadvantaged user was more satisfied with oral health services and the satisfaction increased with age. The improvement in the quality of oral health services in primary care can result in greater satisfaction.

ID OUTCOMES
AB BackgroundEthiopia has been expanding maternity waiting homes to bridge geographical gaps between health facilities and communities in order to improve access to skilled care. In 2015, the Ministry of Health revised its national guidelines to standardize the rapid expansion of waiting homes. Little has been done to document their distribution, service availability and readiness. This paper addresses these gaps as well as their association with perinatal mortality and obstetric complication rates.MethodsWe utilized data from the 2016 national Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care assessment, a census of 3804 public and private health facilities. Data were collected between May and December 2016 through interviews with health care workers, record reviews, and observation of infrastructure. Descriptive statistics describe the distribution and characteristics of waiting homes and linear regression models examined the correlation between independent variables and institutional perinatal and peripartum outcomes.ResultsNationally, about half of facilities had a waiting home. More than two-thirds of facilities in Amhara and half of the facilities in SNNP and Oromia had a home while the region of Gambella had none. Highly urbanized regions had few homes.Conditions were better among homes at hospitals than at health centers. Finished floors, electricity, water, toilets, and beds with mattresses were available at three (or more) out of four hospital homes. Waiting homes in pastoralist regions were often at a disadvantage.Health facilities with waiting homes had similar or lower rates of perinatal death and direct obstetric complication rates than facilities without a home. The perinatal mortality was 47% lower in hospitals with a home than those without. Similarly, the direct obstetric complication rate was 49% lower at hospitals with a home compared to hospitals without.ConclusionsThe findings should inform regional maternal and newborn improvement strategies, indicating gaps in the distribution and conditions, especially in the pastoralist regions. The impact of waiting homes on maternal and perinatal outcomes appear promising and as homes continue to expand, so should efforts to regularly monitor, refine and document their impact.

AB BackgroundSocial anxiety disorder (SAD) is highly prevalent among university students, but the majority of affected students remain untreated. Internet- and mobile-based self-help interventions (IMIs) may be a promising strategy to address this unmet need. This study aims to investigate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of an unguided internet-based treatment for SAD among university students. The intervention is optimized for the treatment of university students and includes one module targeting fear of positive evaluations that is a neglected aspect of SAD treatment.MethodsThe study is a two arm randomized controlled trial in which 200 university students with a primary diagnosis of SAD will be assigned randomly to either a wait-list control group (WLC) or the intervention group (IG). The intervention consists of 9 sessions of an internet-based cognitive-behavioral treatment, which also includes a module on fear of positive evaluation (FPE). Guidance is delivered only on the basis of standardized automatic messages, consisting of positive reinforcements for session completion, reminders, and motivational messages in response to non-adherence. All participants will additionally have full access to treatment as usual. Diagnostic status will be assessed through Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM Disorders (SCID). Assessments will be completed at baseline, 10weeks and 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome will be SAD symptoms at post-treatment, assessed via the Social Phobia Scale (SPS) and the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS). Secondary outcomes will include diagnostic status, depression, quality of life and fear of positive evaluation. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses will be evaluated from a societal and health provider perspective.DiscussionResults of this study will contribute to growing evidence for the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of unguided IMIs for the treatment of SAD in university students. Consequently, this trial may provide valuable information for policy makers and clinicians regarding the allocation of limited treatment resources to such interventions.Trial registrationDRKS00011424 (German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS)) Registered 14/12/2016.

AB Background
   Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the major public health problems in Ethiopia. Data on genetic diversity and resistance profile of circulating TB strains is critical for informing the national TB control program.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional study was conducted on 213 smear positive pulmonary TB patients between 2015 and 2016. Sputum samples were cultured on LJ media following the Petroff's method. Region of difference-9 (RD9)-deletion typing and spoligo-typing were performed for molecular analysis of M. tuberculosis at species and strain levels, respectively. Drug sensitivity and mutation patterns of the isolates were assessed by the conventional indirect proportion method and molecular line probe assays (LPAs), respectively. Data were analyzed using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) software version 20.
   Results
   Spoligo-typing of 150 M. tuberculosis isolates led to 57 different patterns of which 25 were new strains. The majority (71.6%) of the isolates were grouped in to 17 clusters consisting 2 to 24 isolates. The majority of the strains belonged to Euro-American lineage and the predominant spoligotypes were SIT 37 and SIT 149. MDR-TB was detected in 5.2% and 20.3% of new and retreatment cases, respectively. Two MDR-TB isolates exhibited additional resistance to one of the second line anti-TB drugs. Common gene mutations including S531L, S315T1 and M306V were detected in RIF, INH and EMB resistant strains, respectively.
   Conclusions
   The identification of several new strains, higher proportion of MDR-TB and higher clustering rate in this study, warrants the need for re-enforcement of the national TB control program. The detection of common gene mutations in the majority drug resistant strains might suggest the feasibility of LPAs for rapid screening of drug resistant M. tuberculosis strains in Ethiopia.

AB Background
   Despite offering little overall benefit and emerging concerns about their safety, dietary supplements have become increasingly popular. Trust in advertising them may contribute to high confidence in dietary supplements in public opinion.
   Aim
   To develop and validate a screening questionnaire intended for the general public regarding knowledge about dietary supplements and a questionnaire on trust in advertising dietary supplements, and to identify the association between these constructs.
   Materials and methods
   The development and validation of the measures was overseen by the panels of experts. The conceptual frameworks of the constructs were scientifically well grounded. A set of semi-structured interviews and anonymous web-based surveys was performed. The final questionnaire was applied to 220 non-medically educated people and 121 medically educated people.
   Results
   A 17-item questionnaire on knowledge about dietary supplements and eight-item questionnaire on trust in advertising dietary supplements were developed. The measures presented satisfactory proof of validity, however, the psychometric properties of the questionnaire on knowledge were modest. Both the knowledge about dietary supplements in the study group and trust in advertising them were low. A significant negative relationship was found between knowledge about dietary supplements and trust in advertising them among the general public (Pearson's r = -0.42, 95%CI: -0.52 to -0.30, p<0.0001). This association was especially pronounced in people who reported not taking dietary supplements (Pearson's r = -0.61, 95%CI: -0.76 to -0.39, p<0.0001).
   Conclusions
   The extensive advertising of dietary supplements appears to be in conflict with promoting evidence-based knowledge about them, which raises substantial concerns for the public health. The results of the study are only preliminary and require further confirmation and exploration.

AB BackgroundKazakhstan remains a high-burden TB prevalence country with a concomitent high-burden of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. For this reason, we performed an in depth genetic diversity and population structure characterization of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) genetic diversity in Kazakhstan with both patient and community benefit.MethodsA convenience sample of 700 MTC DNA cultures extracts from 630 tuberculosis patients recruited from 12 out of 14 regions in Kazakhstan, between 2010 and 2015, was independently studied by high-throughput hybridization-based methods, TB-SPRINT (59-Plex, n=700), TB-SNPID (50-Plex, n=543). DNA from 391 clinical isolates was successfully typed by two methods. To resolve the population structure of drug-resistant clades in more detail two complementary assays were run on the L2 isolates: an IS6110-NTF insertion site typing assay and a SigE SNP polymorphism assay.ResultsStrains belonged to L2/Beijing and L4/Euro-American sublineages; L2/Beijing prevalence totaled almost 80%. 50% of all samples were resistant to RIF and to INH., Subtyping showed that: (1) all L2/Beijing were modern Beijing and (2) most of these belonged to the previously described 94-32 sublineage (Central Asian/Russian), (3) at least two populations of the Central Asian/Russian sublineages are circulating in Kazakhstan, with different evolutionary dynamics.ConclusionsFor the first time, the global genetic diversity and population structure of M. tuberculosis genotypes circulating in Kazakhstan was obtained and compared to previous local studies. Results suggest a region-specific spread of a very limited number of L2/Beijing clonal complexes in Kazakhstan many strongly associated with an MDR phenotype.

ID COUNTRIES
AB BackgroundHarmful alcohol use is a modifiable risk factor contributing to the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases and deaths and the implementation of policies focused on primary prevention is pivotal to address this challenge. Policies with actions targeting the harmful use of alcohol have been developed in Nigeria. This study is an in-depth analysis of alcohol-related policies in Nigeria and the utilization of WHO Best Buy interventions (BBIs) and multi-sectoral action (MSA) in the formulation of these policies.MethodsA descriptive case study design and the Walt and Gilson framework of policy analysis was utilized for the research. Components of the study included a scoping review consisting of electronic search of Google and three online databases (Google Scholar, Science Direct and PubMed) to identify articles and policy documents with no language and date restrictions. Government institution provided documents which were not online. Thirteen policy documents, reports or articles relevant to the policy formulation process were identified. Other components of the study included interviews with 44 key informants (Bureaucrats and Policy Makers) using a pretested guide. The qualitative data were coded and analyzed using thematic analysis.ResultsFindings revealed that policy actions to address harmful alcohol use are proposed in the 2007 Federal Road Safety Act, the Non-communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Policy and the Strategic Plan of Action. Only one of the best buy interventions, (restricted access to alcohol) is proposed in these policies.Multi-sectoral action for the formulation of alcohol-related policy was low and several relevant sectors with critical roles in policy implementation were not involved in the formulation process. Overall, alcohol currently has no holistic, health-sector led policy document to regulate the marketing, promotion of alcohol and accessibility. A major barrier is the low government budgetary allocation to support the process.ConclusionsNigeria has few alcohol-related policies with weak multi-sectoral action. Funding constraint remains a major threat to the implementation and enforcement of proposed policy actions.

AB Malaria and Lyme disease were the largest vector-borne epidemics in recent US history. Malaria, a mosquito-borne disease with intense transmission, had higher morbidity and mortality, whereas Lyme and other tick-borne diseases are more persistent in the environment. The responses to these two epidemics were markedly different. The anti-malaria campaign involved large-scale public works eradicating the disease within two decades. In contrast, Lyme disease control and prevention focused on the individual, advocating personal protection and backyard control, with the disease incidence steeply increasing since 1980s. Control of Lyme and other tick-borne diseases will require a paradigm shift emphasizing measures to reduce tick and host (deer) populations and a substantial R&D effort. These steps will require changing the political climate, perceptions and opinions to generate support among governmental levels and the general public. Such support is essential for providing a real solution to one of the most intractable contemporary public health problems.

AB BackgroundThe RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework is a useful tool for evaluating the impact of programs in community settings. RE-AIM has been applied to evaluate individual programs but seldom used to evaluate the collective impact of community-based, public health programming developed and delivered by multiple autonomous organizations. The purposes of this paper were to (a) demonstrate how RE-AIM can be operationalized and applied to evaluate the collective impact of similar autonomous programs that promote health and well-being and (b) provide preliminary data on the collective impact of Canadian spinal cord injury (SCI) peer mentorship programs on the delivery of peer mentorship services.MethodsCriteria from all five RE-AIM dimensions were operationalized to evaluate multiple similar community-based programs. For this study, nine provincial organizations that serve people with SCI were recruited from across Canada. Organizations completed a structured self-report questionnaire and participated in a qualitative telephone interview to examine different elements of their peer mentorship program. Data were analyzed using summary statistics.ResultsHaving multiple indicators to assess RE-AIM dimensions provided a broad evaluation of the impact of Canadian SCI peer mentorship programs. Peer mentorship programs reached 1.63% of the estimated Canadian SCI population. The majority (67%) of organizations tracked the effectiveness of peer mentorship through testimonials and reports. Setting-level adoption rates were high with 100% of organizations offering peer mentorship in community and hospital settings. On average, organizations allocated 10.4% of their operating budget and 9.8% of their staff to implement peer mentorship and 89% had maintained their programming for over 10years. Full interpretation of the collective impact of peer mentorship programs was limited as complete data were only collected for 52% of survey questions.ConclusionsThe lack of available organizational data highlights a significant challenge when using RE-AIM to evaluate the collective impact of multiple programs that promote health and well-being. Although researchers are encouraged to use RE-AIM to evaluate the collective impact of programs delivered by different organizations, documenting limitations and providing recommendations should be done to further the understanding of how best to operationalize RE-AIM in these contexts.

AB BackgroundAdherence to weight loss interventions is crucial to successful outcomes, yet little is known about how best to improve it. This suggests a need for developing and improving adherence strategies, such as formal commitments. This review aims to identify the effect of including a commitment device alongside lifestyle interventions on weight loss, and identify the most appropriate delivery mechanisms and target behaviours.MethodsWe searched five databases and hand-searched reference lists for trials of behavioural interventions to achieve weight loss among adults with excess weight or obesity. Interventions incorporating commitment devices were included in a narrative review and meta-analysis where appropriate. Commitment devices with financial incentives were excluded.ResultsOf 2675 unique studies, ten met the inclusion criteria. Data from three randomised trials including 409 participants suggests that commitment interventions increases short-term weight loss by a mean of 1.5kg (95% CI: 0.7, 2.4). Data from two randomised trials including 302 patients suggests that benefits were sustained at 12months (mean difference 1.7kg; 95% CI: 0.0, 3.4). Commitment devices appeared most successful when made publicly, and targeting diet rather than physical activity.ConclusionsUsing commitment devices, such as behavioural contracts, as part of a weight loss intervention may be useful in improving weight loss outcomes and dietary changes, at least in the short-term. However, evidence is limited and of variable quality so results must be interpreted with caution. Poor reporting of intervention details may have limited the number of identified studies. More rigorous methodology and longer term follow-ups are required to determine the effectiveness of behavioural contracts given their potential for use in public health interventions.

AB BackgroundTeenage pregnancy is a serious public health and social problem, with 95% occurring in developing countries. The aim of the study was to investigate the behavioural, familial and social factors associated with teenage pregnancy among girls aged 13-19years in Lira District, Uganda.MethodsPrimary data from a case-control study of teenage girls (aged 13-19years) in Lira District, Uganda was analysed. A Structured questionnaire was administered using face-to-face interviews to collect data on 495 participants, identified through simple random sampling from 32 villages in two counties in Lira District. Data analyses were done using SPSS Statistics 23 for descriptive, bivariate (i.e. Chi-square tests) and multivariable analyses (i.e. logistics regression) used for determining independent associations.ResultsA total of 495 teenage girls participated in the study, however, final analyses were undertaken for 480 respondents. At bivariable analysis, all variables except alcohol consumption were significantly associated with teenage pregnancy. Among the behavioural factors assessed, multivariable analyses showed that having multiple sexual partners, frequent sex and irregular contraceptive use increased the likelihood of teenage pregnancy. Among familial factors, being married was found to increase the likelihood of teenage pregnancy. Peer pressure, sexual abuse and lack of control over sex was observed to increase the likelihood of teenage pregnancy.ConclusionsDemographic, behavioural, familial and social factors are important predictors of teenage pregnancy in Lira District. Interventions focussing on: retaining pregnant and married girls at school, information on sexual and reproductive health of teenage girls, improving access to and information about contraceptive use among teenage girls, improving socio-economic status of households, and law enforcement on sexual abuse among girls may come a long way to improving adolescent sexual and health services in thelow-income settings.

AB Objective
   To assess whether tobacco smoking is associated with Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) and its most severe form, Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD).
   Design
   Case-control study with incident cases using the Spanish public healthcare system.
   Setting
   3 major public hospitals and one family counseling and planning center.
   Population
   Women consulting for troubles related to menstruation and for other motives such as screening for uterine cancer, contraception counseling or desire for pregnancy.
   Methods
   Logistic regression.
   Main outcome measures
   Odds Ratios of PMS and PMDD.
   Results
   285 incident PMS cases and 285 age-matched controls on the one hand, and 88 incident PMDD cases and 176 controls on the other hand participated in the study. The odds of premenstrual disorders was higher in current smokers compared with never smokers: Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.78, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.20-2.63 for PMS and OR = 2.92, 95% CI: 1.55-5.50 for PMDD. For PMS, women who smoke 1 to 5 cigarettes/day presented an OR = 2.82, 95% CI: 1.57-5.06 and those who smoke more than 15 cigarettes/day an OR = 2.52, 95% CI: 0.99-6.40.
   Compared to non-smokers, current and ex-smokers who smoked < 3 pack-years presented an OR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.04-3.08 for PMS, and an OR = 3.06, 95% CI: 1.27-7.35 for PMDD. Smokers of 3 to 8 pack-years presented an OR = 2.34, 95% CI: 1.33-4.13 for PMS and OR = 3.56, 95% CI: 1.55-8.17 for PMDD.
   These results were confirmed by the exposure-effect curve obtained from a cubic spline model.
   Conclusions
   This study shows that smokers are more likely to develop PMS and PMDD.

AB Background
   Despite malaria, malnutrition and anaemia being major public-health challenges in Cameroon, very little has been reported on the interaction between these interconnected health determinants. This study therefore sought to investigate the relationship between malaria, anaemia, nutritional and socio-economic status amongst under-ten children living in six localities within two health districts in the North Region of Cameroon.
   Methods
   Accordingly, a cross-sectional survey was conducted during the peak malaria season in November 2014, in Pitoa and Mayo-Oulo Health Districts. Three hundred and sixty eight children aged 6 months-10 years were enrolled. Structured questionnaires were used to assess socio-economic status. Anthropometric indices were taken using standard methods and nutritional status assessed by calculating Height for Age (HA), Weight for Age (WA) and Weight for Height (WH) z-scores to determine stunting, underweight and wasting respectively. Finger-prick blood samples were used to prepare thin and thick blood smears for microscopy. Whole blood was collected to determine the PCV and blood spots on filter paper were used to extract plasmodium DNA for speciation by PCR.
   Results
   Overall prevalence rates of malaria, malnutrition and anaemia were 32.9%, 54.1% and 20.6% respectively. Stunting, underweight and wasting were detected in 56.9%, 63.5% and 34.8% of the children respectively. There was a significant association between malaria and malnutrition [OR = 1.89, (95% CI: 1.12-3.19); (p = 0.017)]. Malnutrition was also strongly associated with malaria status [OR = 2.07, (95% CI: 1.22-3.53); (p = 0.007)]. The prevalence rates of mild, moderate and severe anaemia were 8.1%, 9.2% and 3.3% respectively. Both malaria status and anaemia correlated with development index [OR = 0.75, (95% CI: 0.58-0.99); (p = 0.042)] and [OR = 1.45, (95% CI: 1.05-2.00); (p = 0.023)] respectively.
   Conclusion
   Our findings show a synergistic relationship between malaria and malnutrition. Effective collaboration between malaria control and nutrition intervention programmes is essential for proper case management and improved socio-economic status.

AB BackgroundThe emergence of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) strains of the important human and animal pathogen Salmonella enterica poses a growing threat to public health. Here, we studiedthe genome-wide evolution of 90S. enterica AMR isolates, representing one host adapted serotype (S. Dublin) and two broad host range serotypes (S. Newport and S. Typhimurium).ResultsAMR S. Typhimurium had a large effective population size, a large and diverse genome, AMR profiles with high diversity, and frequent positive selection and homologous recombination. AMR S. Newport showed a relatively low level of diversity and a relatively clonal population structure. AMR S. Dublin showed evidence for a recent population bottleneck, and the genomes were characterized by a larger number of genes and gene ontology terms specifically absent from this serotype and a significantly higher number of pseudogenes as compared to other two serotypes. Approximately 50% of accessory genes, including specific AMR and putative prophage genes, were significantly over- or under-represented in a given serotype. Approximately 65% of the core genes showed phylogenetic clustering by serotype, including the AMR gene aac (6)-Iaa. While cell surface proteins were shown to be the main target of positive selection, some proteins with possible functions in AMR and virulence also showed evidence for positive selection. Homologous recombination mainly acted on prophage-associated proteins.ConclusionsOur data indicates a strong association between genome content of S. enterica and serotype. Evolutionary patterns observed in S. Typhimurium are consistent with multiple emergence events of AMR strains and/or ecological success of this serotype in different hosts or habitats. Evolutionary patterns of S. Newport suggested that antimicrobial resistance emerged in one single lineage, Lineage IIC. A recent population bottleneck and genome decay observed in AMR S. Dublin are congruent with its narrow host range. Finally, our results suggest the potentially important role of positive selection in the evolution of antimicrobial resistance, host adaptation and serotype diversification in S. enterica.

AB BackgroundSmall for gestational age (SGA) infants are those born small for their gestational age, with weight below the 10th percentile. Not only do SGA infants suffer growth issues after birth, they have elevated risk for the development of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases later in life. Current research has suggested that in cases of SGA infants, maternal milk and breastfeeding are not affected.Case summaryThe mother of an SGA infant was diagnosed with placental insufficiency and Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) during her pregnancy. The infant was born term, at 38weeks 3days, and SGA. The mother had a low milk supply and her milk composition differed from reference values such that the daily infant intake provided less than 50% of the required energy intake at 3months.ConclusionIn cases of SGA and/or GDM, maternal milk quality and quantity may be compromised. This requires follow-up in order to reduce the disease risk for SGA infants and the corresponding public health implications.

AB BackgroundHIV/AIDS has emerged as a serious public health issue across the globe, and particularly in developing countries. Comprehensive knowledge and positive attitudes are cornerstones for the prevention, control and treatment of HIV/AIDS. However, there are various misconceptions associated with HIV/AIDS transmission, which lead to negative attitudes towards people living with AIDS. The present study aims to explore the effects of these determinants, related to socio-demographic characteristics and autonomy, on women's overall knowledge and attitudes regarding HIV/AIDS in Pakistan.MethodsSecondary data analysis was carried out using the national representative dataset of the 2012-13 Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey. A series of questions related to HIV/AIDS was asked of 13,558 ever-married women aged 15-49years to assess respondents' knowledge regarding modes of HIV/AIDS transmission and preventative measures, as well as their attitudes towards people living with HIV/AIDS. Descriptive and bivariate statistics were used to identify associations with socio-demographic and autonomy-related variables. Furthermore, bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between multiple factors and overall HIV/AIDS knowledge as well as attitudes towards people living with AIDS.ResultsThe results show that only 42% of Pakistani women have heard about HIV/AIDS. Amongst these women, the majority (68%) have good overall knowledge of HIV/AIDS and more than 55% have positive attitudes towards people living with AIDS. Furthermore, women residing in urban areas, having at least secondary-level education, with high autonomy, belonging to the richest wealth quintile and having exposure to mass media had high overall knowledge and positive attitudes towards people living with AIDS.ConclusionThe findings of this research support the relevance of women's autonomy, education and exposure to mass media, particularly in rural areas of Pakistan, to address the lack of knowledge and eliminate various myths and stigmatisation of people living with HIV/AIDS. Furthermore, it reveals a need to increase focused and targeted interventions to enhance women's knowledge and positive attitudes towards people living with HIV/AIDS. In this regard, the media can play a proactive role to gauge wider audience in creating awareness and eradicating the myths and misconceptions regarding HIV/AIDS.

AB BackgroundDrowning is a leading and preventable cause of death that has suffered an attention deficit. Improving drowning data in countries would assist the understanding of the full extent and circumstances of drowning, to target interventions and evaluate their effectiveness. The World Health Organization identifies data collection as a key strategy underpinning effective interventions. This study compares unintentional fatal drowning data collection, management and comparison using the databases of Australia, Canada and New Zealand.MethodsCases of fatal unintentional drowning between 1-January-2005 and 31-December-2014 were extracted. Cases were combined into a single dataset and univariate and chi square analysis (p<0.01) were undertaken. Location and activity variables were mapped and combined. Variables consistently collected across the three countries were compared to the ILCOR Drowning Data Guideline. The authors also recommend variables for a minimum core dataset.ResultsOf 55 total variables, 19 were consistent and 13 could be compared across the three databases. When mapped against the ILCOR Drowning Data Guideline, six variables were consistently collected by all countries, with five compared within this study. The authors recommend a minimum core dataset of 11 variables including age, sex, location, activity, date of incident, and alcohol and drug involvement).There were 8176 drowning deaths (Australia 34.1%, Canada 55.9%, New Zealand 9.9%). All countries achieved reductions in crude drowning rates (Australia -10.2%, Canada -20.4%, New Zealand -24.7%). Location and activity prior to drowning differed significantly across the three countries. Beaches (X-2=1151.0;p<0.001) and ocean/harbour locations (X-2=300.5;p<0.001) were common in Australia and New Zealand, while lakes/ponds (X-2=826.5;p<0.001) and bathtubs (X-2=27.7;p<0.001) were common drowning locations in Canada. Boating prior to drowning was common in Canada (X-2=66.3;p<0.001).ConclusionsThe comparison of data across the three countries was complex. Work was required to merge categories within the 20% of variables collected that were comparable, thus reducing the fidelity of data available. Data sources, collection and coding varied by country, with the widest diversity seen in location and activity variables. This study highlights the need for universally agreed and consistently applied categories and definitions to allow for global comparisons and proposes a core minimum dataset.

AB BackgroundHIV disproportionately infects women in many regions. Zimbabwe is one of the countries, most heavily affected. Unequal gender power relations between men and women can increase women's vulnerability to HIV. The aim of this paper was to determine the relationship between gender power and HIV sero-status among postpartum women in Zimbabwe.MethodologyA cross-sectional survey was conducted among 2042 women aged 15-49years, attending postnatal-care at six public primary health care clinics in low-income urban communities of Harare in 2011. Women were asked about relationship power factors using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire included adapted WHO multi-country study items, which measure partner violence perpetrated against women. HIV status data were based on rapid HIV diagnostic tests done during earlier antenatal visits. The analysis was restricted to women with known HIV test results (n=1951). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the predictors of HIV and relationship power factors.ResultsHIV prevalence was 15.3% (n=299/1951). Three quarters of the women (76.9%, n=1438/1871) reported some level of relationship control in their current/most recent intimate relationship. HIV positive women reported higher levels of control by the male partner in their intimate relationships. In adjusted models, the study found a significant association between relationship-control by the male partner and women's HIV status (AOR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01-1.22), and the decision-making dimensions of relationship power. Although there were indications of high male partner control in participants' intimate relationships, some women still had agency, as they were able to make independent decisions to fall pregnant. These women were less likely to be HIV positive (AOR 0.54, 95% CI 0.29-1.00). Having a partner who ever refused use of a family planning method was associated with increased odds of having a positive HIV status among the postpartum women (AOR 1.88, 95% CI 1.20-2.90).ConclusionUnequal gender power relations continue to be a risk factor for heterosexual transmission of HIV. This suggests that prevention efforts have not successfully resulted in gender equality. HIV prevention interventions should address gender power dynamics to help curb the disproportionate HIV burden among women.

AB BackgroundWorkplace presenteeism is common and leads to the spread of infectious diseases. Previous reviews have focused on presenteeism in relation to general physical or mental ill health. In this systematic review we identified the prevalence of, and reasons and risk factors for, presenteeism in relation to an infectious illness.MethodWe searched Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO and PsycARTICLES with terms relating to infectious illnesses and presenteeism at the work place or school; reference lists of relevant articles were also hand-searched.ResultOur search yielded 3580 papers after deduplication. After title, abstract and full text screening, 23 papers reporting on 24 studies were included. Twenty-three studies were cross-sectional studies and one was prospective. The quality of included studies was relatively poor due to problems such as sampling and non-response bias. Presenteeism prevalence ranged from 35 to 97%. Self-reported reasons for presenteeism fell into three main themes: 1. Organisational factors (organisational policy, presenteeism culture, disciplinary action), 2. Job characteristics (lack of cover, professionalism, job demand), and 3. Personal reasons (burden on colleagues, colleague perceptions, threshold of sickness absence and financial concerns). Statistical risk factors fell into four themes: 1. Sociodemographic, 2. Health, 3. Influenza-related behaviour, and 4. Employment characteristics. Most of the risk factors had insufficient evidence to allow us to draw any firm conclusions, and evidence regarding gender and age was inconsistent. The risk factor with the most consistent findings concerned occupation type, suggesting that those who worked in the healthcare sector, and specifically physicians, were at a higher risk of infectious illness presenteeism.ConclusionInfectious illness presenteeism is common. To address the public health consequences, organisations should focus on promoting a positive working culture and developing sickness absence policies that reduce presenteeism. Further research is needed in non-health sector organisations and schools to identify risk factors related to different organisations, which can then be used to tailor interventions at the organisational and individual level.

AB Canine brucellosis, caused by Brucella canis, is a disease of dogs and represents a public health concern as it can be transmitted to humans. Canine brucellosis is on the rise in the United States and there is currently no vaccine for use in dogs. Mice have been extensively utilized to investigate host-pathogen interactions and vaccine candidates for smooth Brucella species and could serve a similar role for studying B. canis. However, comparatively little is known about B. canis infection in mice. The objective of this study was to characterize the kinetics of colonization and pathogenicity of B. canis in mice in order to evaluate the mouse as a model for studying this pathogen. C57BL/6 mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 10(5), 10(7), or 10(9) CFU of Brucella canis RM6/66 and euthanized 1-, 2-, 4-, 6-, 9-, and 12-weeks post-inoculation. B. canis induced splenomegaly in mice infected with 10(9) CFU at 1-and 2 weeks post-inoculation while no gross lesions were observed in other dose groups. Infection at the two higher doses resulted in dose-dependent granulomatous hepatitis and histiocytic infiltration of the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes by 1-2 weeks. B. canis was cultured from the liver, spleen, uterus, bone marrow, lung, and kidney in all groups with colonization declining at a slow but steady rate throughout the experiment. Clearance was achieved by 9 weeks 10(5) CFU group and by 12 weeks in the 10(7) CFU group, while B. canis persisted in the spleen until 12 weeks in the highest dose group. Although B. canis does not demonstrate significant replication in C57BL/6 mice, it has the ability to establish an infection, induce splenomegaly, and persist for several weeks in multiple organs. Moreover, 1 x 10(7) CFU appears to be a suitable challenge dose for investigating vaccine safety.

AB BackgroundHPV vaccination for the prioritized adolescent girls is well accepted and implemented in developed countries as an effective measure for cervical cancer prevention and control with increasing population-level effectiveness evidence accumulated. This study is to assess the feasibility of universal HPV vaccination among adolescent girls to inform strategies to manage political dimensions of policy-making process in Shenzhen, China, offering insights for other low- and middle-income countries undergoing HPV vaccine introduction.MethodsDocument review and in-depth interviews with identified stakeholders were conducted. The framework of Health Policy Triangle was adapted to guide data collection and analysis in terms of context, actors, process and content. Stakeholder analysis examining actors' position, power, role and interest and thematic analysis focusing on data coding and theme development were used.ResultsShenzhen's contextual factors include legislative authority under a unitary political system, economic developments and cultural values on immunization and sexuality. Stakeholders' position and power could be explained by their role and interest in the Top-down health administration. Mothers could be potential bystanders if having little knowledge on HPV vaccination. Themes in policy-making process were problem definition, advocacy activities to promote HPV vaccination, HPV vaccine demand and access, the role of media and political attention on evidence-informed policy-making in Shenzhen. These stakeholders also discussed different aspects of program planning prospectively.ConclusionsShenzhen witnesses a possibility of demonstration projects for local government's horizontal accountability but no potential advocates were identified at local level for fragmented organization of public health facilities and health professionals' lacking mobilization skills. A cervical cancer prevention expert could be a policy entrepreneur. Despite of these challenges, the recommendations to enhance the feasibility include multi-participation to engage non-governmental organizations, pharmaceuticals, target girls and their mothers, power enforcement along governing system, as well as better use of the media.

AB BackgroundSocially disadvantaged groups, such as drug users, sex workers and homeless individuals, are labelled as hard-to-reach (HTR) in public health and medical research. HIV disproportionately impacts these populations, but data on how the HTR status could affect antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among HIV-positive people are limited and have not been previously synthesized in a systematic manner. We performed a meta-analysis to explore the association between HTR status and optimal antiretroviral therapy adherence in the HIV-infected population to provide evidence and recommendations regarding ART adherence improvement and HIV infection control and prevention among HTR people.MethodsThe PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrance Library databases and the bibliographies of relevant studies were systematically searched up to December 2018. Full-text studies published in English were included, and no geographic or race restrictions were applied. Studies that quantitatively assessed the association between HTR status and optimal ART adherence among HIV-infected populations with a status of homelessness, sex work, or drug use were eligible for inclusion. We estimated the pooled odds ratios (ORs) of HTR characteristics related to ART adherence from each eligible study using a random effects model. The sensitivity, heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed.ResultsOur search identified 593 articles, of which 29 studies were eligible and included in this meta-analysis. The studies were carried out between 1993 and 2017 and reported between 1999 and 2018. The results showed that HTR status resulted in a 45% reduction in the odds of achieving optimal ART adherence compared to odds in the general population (OR=0.55, 95% confidential intervals (CIs) 0.49-0.62), and this significant inverse association was consistently found regardless of study design, exposure measurement, adherence cut-off points, etc. Subgroup analyses revealed that the HTRs tend to be suboptimal adhering during a longer observational period.ConclusionsHIV treatment adherence is extremely negatively affected by HTR status. It is crucial to develop appropriate interventions to improve ART adherence and health outcomes among HTR people who are HIV-infected.

AB BackgroundCurrently, WeChat is widely used in disease education for patients with Crohn's disease (CD) in China. It is beneficial for the patients to actively engage in their disease management.MethodsIn this study, we examined the source and expectations of disease information for Chinese CD patients, analysing the content of popular WeChat public accounts and their potential association with medication adherence.ResultsBetween November 24th, 2017 and April 10th, 2018, online questionnaires were sent to CD patients from eight different large urban hospitals in China. In all, 436 patients with CD were surveyed, and 342 patients responded. Patients most frequently visited Baidu (65%), WeChat (61%) and medical websites such as Haodaifu (35%) when searching for IBD-related information. Among ten WeChat IBD public accounts, the China Crohn's and Colitis Foundation (CCCF) (73%), IBD Academic Officer (21%) and IBD in love (21%) were the most popular. CD patients were most interested in information from the internet about diet and day-to-day health-related living with IBD (83%), an introduction to the disease (80%), and medication advances and side effects (80%). The correlation between the information provided by the top five WeChat public accounts and patients' expectations was low. Additionally, most patients (64%) had greater confidence in overcoming the disease after learning about CD through their internet searches. Medical adherence was also related to internet access and income (p<0.05).ConclusionsWeChat has become a major source of information for IBD education in China, but the content of WeChat didn't fully meet patients' expectations. Therefore, future initiatives should aim to provide high-quality information that based on patients' demands.

ID NEUROCYSTICERCOSIS
AB BackgroundCysticercosis is an emerging and neglected tropical disease (NTD) that poses a serious public health concern worldwide. Disseminated cysticercosis (DCC) is an uncommon manifestation of cysticercosis, also found in China.Case presentationWe report three cases of DCC in patients living in China, with different clinical and radiological presentations. All three patients had DCC with active ocular cysticercosis, including one patient with widespread DCC caused by direct ingestion of Taenia solium eggs. The intravitreal cysticercus cyst in this patient was completely extracted entirely by 23-gauge pars plana vitrectomy, and the cyst was oval in shape on the flat mount preparation.ConclusionThe clinical presentation of DCC is highly sophisticated. The diagnosis depended on the typical radiological presentations, biopsy and flat mount preparations of the cyst.

TI Evaluability assessment of "growing healthy communities," a mini-grant

AB BackgroundMini-grants have been used to stimulate multisector collaboration in support of public health initiatives by funding non-traditional partners, such as economic development organizations. Such mini-grants have the potential to increase access to healthy foods and places for physical activity through built environment change, especially in small and rural towns in the United States. Although a promising practice, few mini-grant evaluations have been done. Therefore, our purpose was to conduct an Evaluability Assessment (EA), which is a process that can help promising programs that lack evidence advance toward full-scale evaluation. Specifically, we conducted an Evaluability Assessment of a statewide mini-grant program, called Growing Healthy Communities (GHC), to determine if this program was ready for evaluation and identify any changes needed for future implementation and evaluation that could also inform similar programs.MethodsTelephone interviews with directors of six past mini-grant recipient organizations were conducted to assess implementation and evaluability. The six interviews were split equally among agencies receiving funding for food-oriented projects and physical activity-oriented projects. Within- and cross-case thematic analyses of interview transcripts were conducted.ResultsOrganizational capacity was a universal theme, reflecting other key themes (described in detail in the manuscript) that affected program implementation and evaluation, including collaboration, limited time and measurement integration. Conclusions. The EA process provided pilot data that suggest that other state, regional, and national funders should provide centralized assistance for data collection and evaluation from the outset of a mini-grant award program.

TI Changes in inequality of childhood morbidity in Bangladesh 1993-2014: A

AB Introduction
   Child health remains an important public health concern at the global level, with preventable diseases such as diarrheal disease, acute respiratory infection (ARI) and fever posing a large public health burden in low-and middle-income countries including Bangladesh. Improvements in socio-economic conditions have tended to benefit advantaged groups in societies, which has resulted in widespread inequalities in health outcomes. This study examined how socioeconomic inequality is associated with childhood morbidity in Bangladesh, and identified the factors affecting three illnesses: diarrhea, ARI and fever.
   Materials and methods
   A total of 43,860 sample observations from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey, spanning a 22-year period (1993-2014), were analysed. Concentration curve and concentration index methods were used to evaluate changes in the degree of household wealth-related inequalities and related trends in childhood morbidity. Regression-based decomposition analyses were used to attribute the inequality disparities to individual determinants for the three selected causes of childhood morbidity.
   Results
   The overall magnitude of inequality in relation to childhood morbidity has been declining slowly over the 22-year period. The magnitude of socio-economic inequality as a cause of childhood morbidity varied during the period. Decomposition analyses attributed the inequalities to poor maternal education attainment, inadequate pre-delivery care, adverse chronic undernutrition status and low immunisation coverage.
   Conclusions
   High rates of childhood morbidity were observed, although these have declined over time. Socio-economic inequality is strongly associated with childhood morbidity. Socio-economically disadvantaged communities need to be assisted and interventions should emphasise improvements of, and easier access to, health care services. These will be key to improving the health status of children in Bangladesh and should reduce economic inequality through improved health over time.

TI Hospital productivity bias when not adjusting for cost heterogeneity:
   The case of Spain
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PANEL-DATA; HEALTH-CARE; EFFICIENCY; INEFFICIENCY
AB This research quantifies the bias caused in hospital productivity measurements when cost heterogeneity is not considered. A multi-output stochastic cost frontier under a normalised translog specification is used to approximate the structure of technology of a sample of public general hospitals in Spain during the period 2002-2009. To control for observable heterogeneity in costs, a set of variables related to hospital characteristics are included in the cost frontier specification (i.e., hospital complexity, degree of specialisation, availability of outpatient clinics, variety of high-technology equipment available, teaching activity and quality of care), whereas unobservable heterogeneity is accounted for by means of individual dummy variables. A measure of hospitals' cost efficiency is first obtained, and the analysis is then completed by measuring and decomposing the total factor productivity index (TFP-I) change. Findings reveal that controlling for heterogeneity decreases total productivity from an annual average rate of 0.028% to 1.330%, mainly driven by the negative contribution of the cost efficiency change component. Hence, a bias of 1.303 percentage points in the overall TFP-I is found as consequence of not controlling for heterogeneity. In addition to this, if heterogeneity factors are not accounted for, the mean cost efficiency index during the period analysed is 0.730, figure that increases up to 0.974 if heterogeneity is considered. Hence, the omission of heterogeneity leads to a bias of 24.4 percentage points in the mean cost efficiency. Therefore, not adjusting for heterogeneity in costs gives rise to distorted measurements of hospital productivity, as well as distortions in the contribution of each of its components, which may lead to the adoption of inadequate policies and decisions on resource allocation.

AB We evaluated the difference in awareness of stroke warning signs (SWS) and emergency response among occupational groups in the community-dwelling population. From the 2016 Korea Community Health Survey, a total of 10,445 individuals without stroke were included in the analysis. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to explore the association of occupation with awareness of SWS and correct emergency response. SWS included the following: sudden numbness or weakness, sudden difficulty speaking or understanding speech, sudden dizziness, sudden visual impairment, and sudden severe headache. Respondents' occupation was classified into six groups: managers and professionals (MP); clerks; service and sales workers (SSW); agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers (AFFW); mechanical and manual laborers (MML); or housewives and unemployed people (HUP). Awareness of each SWS was the same with the highest for MP and lowest for AFFW. After adjusting for socio-demographic factors, compared to MP (reference), AFFW (odds ratio 0.49; 95% confidence interval 0.36-0.67), HUP (0.55; 0.40-0.75), MML (0.57; 0.42-0.79), and SSW (0.62; 0.45-0.86) had significantly lower ORs for knowing at least one of the SWS. Additionally, AFFW (0.79; 0.66-0.96) and MML (0.76; 0.63-0.91) had significantly lower ORs for knowing all five SWS compared to MP. However, there was no significant occupational difference in correct emergency response when a stroke occurred. To improve stroke literacy and to reduce the disparity of awareness of SWS in community settings, public health efforts with an emphasis on AFFW and MML are needed.

ID HEPATITIS-E VIRUS; EXPRESSION; RESPONSES; CELLS; MODEL; RISK; INOS; PIG
AB Hepatitis E virus genotype 3 (HEV-3) is an emerging zoonotic pathogen, responsible for sporadic cases of acute hepatitis E worldwide. Primate models have proven to be an essential tool for the study of HEV pathogenesis. Here we describe the outcomes of HEV infection in Macaca fascicularis (cynomolgus) inoculated experimentally with genotype 3. Eight adult cynomolgus macaques were inoculated intravenously with HEV-3 viral particles isolated from swine and human samples. Liver, spleen, duodenum, gallbladder and bile were sequential assessed up to the end-point of this study, 67 days post-inoculation (dpi). Our previously published findings showed that biochemical parameters return gradually to baseline levels at 55 dpi, whereas anti-HEV IgM and HEV RNA become undetectable in the serum and feces of all animals, indicating a non-viremic phase of recovery. Nevertheless, at a later stage during convalescence (67 dpi), the presence of HEV-3 RNA and antigen persist in central organs, even after peripheral viral clearance. Our results show that two cynomolgus inoculated with swine HEV-3 (animals I3 and O1) presented persistence of HEV RNA low titers in liver, gallbladder and bile. At this same stage of infection, HEV antigen (HEV Ag) could be detected in all infected animals, predominantly in non-reactive Kupffer cells (CD68+iNOS-) and sinusoidal lining cells. Simultaneously, CD4+, CD3+CD4+, and CD3+ CD8+ immune cells were identified in hepatic sinusoids and small inflammatory clusters of lobular mononuclear cells, at the end-point of this study. Inability of HEV clearance in humans can result in chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, with subsequent liver failure requiring transplantation. The results of our study support the persistence of HEV-3 during convalescence at 67 dpi, with active immune response in NHP. We alert to the inherent risk of viral transmission through liver transplantation, even in the absence of clinical and biochemical signs of acute infection. Thus, besides checking conventional serological markers of HEV infection, we strongly recommend HEV-3 RNA and antigen detection in liver explants as public health measure to prevent donor-recipient transmission and spread of hepatitis E.

AB BackgroundIn many low and middle-income countries (LMICs), difficulties in patient identification are a major obstacle to the delivery of longitudinal care. In absence of unique identifiers, biometrics have emerged as an attractive solution to the identification problem. We developed an mHealth App for subject identification using pattern recognition around ear morphology (Project SEARCH (Scanning EARS for Child Health). Early field work with the SEARCH App revealed that image stabilization would be required for optimum performance.MethodsTo improve image capture, we designed and tested a device (the Donut'), which standardizes distance, angle, rotation and lighting. We then ran an experimental trial with 194 participants to measure the impact of the Donut on identification rates. Images of the participant's left ear were taken both with and without use of the Donut, then processed by the SEARCH algorithm, measuring the top one and top ten most likely matches.ResultsWith the Donut, the top one identification rate and top ten identification rates were 99.5 and 99.5%, respectively, vs. 38.4 and 24.1%, respectively, without the Donut (P<0.0001 for each comparison). In sensitivity analyses, crop technique during pre-processing of images had a powerful impact on identification rates, but this too was facilitated through the Donut.ConclusionsBy standardizing lighting, angle and spatial location of the ear, the Donut achieved near perfect identification rates on a cohort of 194 participants, proving the feasibility and effectiveness of using the ear as a biometric identifier.Trial registrationThis study did not include a medical intervention or assess a medical outcome, and therefore did not meet the definition of a human subjects research study as defined by FDAAA. We did not register our study under clinicaltrials.gov.

AB BackgroundThe food environment can influence opportunities and barriers to food access. This study aimed to investigate whether access to healthy foods varies according to store types and the socioeconomic status of the users of the public health promotion program in Brazil, known as the Health Academy Program.MethodsA total of 18 Health Academy Program centers were selected via simple conglomerate sampling. Health Academy Program users living up to 1km from the food stores were evaluated (n=2831). Their socioeconomic status was investigated via face-to-face interviews. The food stores were audited through direct observation. Variables included the community nutrition environment (type and location) and consumer nutrition environment (healthy food store index, involving variables such as availability, variety, and advertising of healthy and unhealthy products). Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to examine the association between access to healthy foods, socioeconomic status, and food store type.ResultsA total of 336 stores were investigated. The majority were specialty fruit and vegetable markets/stores or open-air food markets. Access to healthy food was only associated with the food store type. An increase of 1% in the availability of specialized fruits and vegetable markets or open-air food markets and supermarket raised healthy food store index values by 0.12 and 0.07, respectively.ConclusionsPublic food supply policies aimed at improving the diet quality of the population and reducing inequality in access should prioritize the implementation of stores of better quality, such as specialty fruit and vegetable markets and open-air food markets.

AB BackgroundTobacco smoking is considered as a major public health issue worldwide. Reduction of tobacco usage has been one of the main government policies in Sri Lanka and the price of cigarettes has been raised several times in the last few years. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the socioeconomic factors associated with tobacco smoking among adult males in Sri Lanka.MethodsA study was conducted in Gampaha district in Sri Lanka recruiting 365 tobacco smoking people and their spouses. Data regarding tobacco smoking were obtained using an interviewer administrated questionnaire.ResultsFrequency of tobacco smoking was negatively associated with the improvement of educational levels. Employment, monthly income, influence of friends, smoking frequency before price increment, weekly expenditure for smoking, low educational level and the age of first smoking exposure was significantly associated with tobacco smoking among smokers. According to the spouses, smoking frequency before price increment, weekly expenditure of the husbands of smoking and influence of friends, number on smoking friends, spouse's employment and husband's monthly income were factors associated with tobacco smoking of their husbands. In addition, smoking at home, at work places and at friend's houses was significant with the frequency of daily smoking.ConclusionsIncreasing the price of tobacco products has no significant impact on smoking behaviors in Sri Lanka. The need for essential strategies to educate and motivate the smokers to stop smoking is required. Primary care health workers might play a major role in motivating smokers to quit smoking.

AB BackgroundTo assess the prevalence and severity of caries in 12- and 15-year-old schoolchildren, and to analyse the related risk factors.MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study on a random sample of 1843 schoolchildren aged 12 and 15 from Galicia (northwest of Spain). Self-administered questionnaire and dental clinical examination were performed to obtain information about oral health habits, dental caries and oral hygiene. A logistic regression model including dental-caries-related variables was generated for each age group.ResultsThe respective findings for 12- and 15-years-old were as follows: decayed, missing, filled teeth index both for permanent and temporary dentition (DMFT/dmft) of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.87-0.91) and 1.38 (95% CI, 1.33-1.43), respectively; caries prevalence 39.6% (95% CI, 36.3-42.9) and 51.7% (95% CI, 48.0-55.4), respectively. In the 12-year-old group, individuals who occasionally, never or hardly ever brushed their teeth had higher values of caries (OR=1.83, 95% CI 1.07-3.15, and OR=9.14, 95% CI1.63-51.17, respectively). Also, the presence of plaque on more than 1/3 gingival was statistically associated with an increase of caries (OR=2.03; 95% CI, 1.11-3.70), and living in a rural environment was a risk factor (OR=1.3; 95% CI,1.02-1.80). In the 15-year-old group, higher caries risk was found when brushing was performed once a day (OR=1.61; 95% CI,1.03-2.50), and among individuals who visited private clinics (OR=1.77; 95% CI, 1.17-2.66), while electric toothbrush was associated with a lower caries risk (OR=0.50; 95% CI, 0.29-0.86).ConclusionsThis study revealed that risk factors of dental caries showed differences in schoolchildren of 12- and 15-year-old. Strongest evidence related to caries in 12-year-old group were found in frequency of toothbrushing and dental plaque. In 15-year old group, electric toothbrush, time since the last visit to the dentist and type of dental care (public/private) had a stronger association with dental caries. Caries prevalence and mean DMFT/dmft increased from 12- to 15-year-old, in spite of improvement in oral hygiene at the age of 15.

AB Background
   Current tools and strategies are not sufficient to reliably address threats and outbreaks of arboviruses including Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever. Hence there is a growing public health challenge to identify the best new control tools to use against the vector Aedes aegypti. In this study, we investigated Ae. aegypti sugar feeding strategies in Bamako, Mali, to determine if this species can be controlled effectively using attractive toxic sugar baits (ATSB).
   Methodology
   We determined the relative attraction of Ae. aegypti males and females to a variety of sugar sources including flowers, fruits, seedpods, and honeydew in the laboratory and using plant-baited traps in the field. Next, we observed the rhythm of blood feeding versus sugar feeding activity of Ae. aegypti in vegetation and in open areas. Finally, we studied the effectiveness of spraying vegetation with ATSB on Ae. aegypti in sugar rich (lush vegetation) and in sugar poor (sparse vegetation) urban environments.
   Principal findings
   Male and female laboratory sugar feeding rates within 24 h, on 8 of 16 plants offered were over 80%. The survival rates of mosquitoes on several plant sources were nearly as long as that of controls maintained on sucrose solution. In the field, females were highly attracted to 11 of 20 sugar sources, and 8 of these were attractive to males. Peak periods of host attraction for blood-feeding and sugar feeding in open areas were nearly identical and occurred shortly after sunrise and around sunset. In shaded areas, the first sugar-seeking peak occurred between 11: 30 and 12: 30 while the second was from 16: 30 to 17: 30. In a 50-day field trial, ATSB significantly reduced mean numbers of landing / biting female Ae. aegypti in the two types of vegetation. At sugar poor sites, the mean pre-treatment catch of 20.51 females on day 14 was reduced 70-fold to 0.29 on day 50. At sugar rich sites, the mean pretreatment catch of 32.46 females on day 14 was reduced 10-fold to a mean of 3.20 females on day 50.
   Conclusions
   This is the first study to show how the vector Ae. aegypti depends on environmental resources of sugar for feeding and survival. The demonstration that Ae. aegypti populations rapidly collapsed after ATSB treatment, in both sugar rich and sugar poor environments, is strong evidence that Ae. aegypti is sugar-feeding frequently. Indeed, this study clearly demonstrates that Ae. aegypti mosquitoes depend on natural sugar resources, and a promising new method for vector control, ATSB, can be highly effective in the fight against Aedestransmitted diseases.

AB BackgroundFew cases of organophosphate poisoning in developing countries have been investigated using clinical and epidemiological methods. On 30 October 2015, 3 students at Mukuju School, Tororo District, Uganda, died soon after eating chapatti (locally-made flat bread) from the same food stand. Ministry of Health investigated to identify the cause and recommend prevention measures.MethodsWe defined a case as onset during 30-31 October 2015 in a resident of Mukuju Town of 1 of the following symptoms: excessive saliva, profuse sweating, dizziness, low blood pressure, constricted pupils or loss of consciousness. We reviewed medical/police records and interviewed survivors, healthcare workers, and police officers. We collected samples of implicated food for toxicological analysis. Autopsies were performed on decedents to identify the cause of death.ResultsWe identified 7 cases with 3 deaths (case-fatality ratio=43%). Clinical manifestations included acute onset of confusion (100%), constricted pupils (43%), excessive saliva (43%), and low blood pressure (43%). All 7 cases had onset from 16:00-18:00h on 30 October, with a point-source exposure pattern. Of the 7 cases, 86% (6/7) were men; the mean age was 24 (range: 20-32) years. The 3 decedents each ate a whole chapatti while the other 4 cases ate half or less. Autopsy findings of the 3 decedents indicated organophosphate poisoning. Toxicological analysis found high levels of malathion in leftover foods (266mg/L in dough and 258mg/L in chapatti) and malaoxon (a highly toxic malathion derivative) in decedents' postmortem specimens (mean levels of 19mg/L in the blood and 22mg/L in the gastric contents). There was a delay of 4h before the patients received appropriate treatment. Police investigations revealed that flour used to make the chapatti was intentionally contaminated with an organophosphate pesticide.ConclusionThis fatal outbreak of organophosphate poisoning was associated with consumption of roadside-vended chapatti made of flour contaminated with pesticide. Clinicians should be aware of symptoms of organophosphate poisoning and prepared to treat it quickly. Street vendors should carefully consider the source of their ingredients. An in-depth surveillance review of such poisonings in Uganda would guide policymakers in reducing access by criminals and accidental exposures for the public.

AB BackgroundIn Canada, there is a growing need to develop community-based, culturally appropriate palliative care for Indigenous people living in First Nations communities. The public health approach to palliative care, which emphasizes community-based initiatives, is especially relevant in First Nations communities because care is grounded in their distinct social and cultural context. Central to the public health approach are educational strategies that strengthen communities' capacity to care for their vulnerable members as they die. This paper presents community-based research conducted with First Nations communities in Canada that aimed to assess and address local palliative care educational needs to improve community capacity in palliative care.MethodsParticipatory action research (PAR) was conducted with four First Nations communities in Canada over a six-year period (2010-2016). The research occurred in three phases. Phase 1: focus groups, interviews and surveys were employed to assess community specific needs and resources. Phase 2: recommendations were developed to guide the PAR process. Phase 3: educational resources were created to address the identified educational needs. These resources were implemented incrementally over 4 years. Ongoing process evaluation was employed, and revisions were made as required.ResultsEducational needs were identified for patients, families, community members and internal and external health care providers. A wide and comprehensive range of educational resources were created to address those needs. Those culturally appropriate educational resources are available in a very accessible and useable workbook format and are available for use by other Indigenous people and communities.ConclusionsThis research provides an example of the public health approach and offers implementation strategies around palliative care education. This paper contributes to the international literature on the public health approach to palliative care by presenting a case study from Canada that includes: conducting a culturally appropriate assessment of educational needs, creating recommendations, facilitating development and implementation of educational resources in the community to improve community capacity in palliative care.

AB BackgroundDistribution of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes varies significantly worldwide. Genomic diversity between genotypes has implications for treatment, vaccine development and optimal design of HCV diagnostic assays. Molecular characterization of HCV in different geographical areas is therefore very essential for management and public health control of HCV infection. This study investigated the molecular epidemiology and characteristics of HCV genotypes in healthy individuals in Accra, Ghana.MethodsAn experimental study was carried out on blood samples obtained from voluntary blood donors. Two hundred samples were initially screened for HCV antibodies and infection was confirmed by RNA detection through RT-PCR of the 5-untranslated region (5'UTR). The core gene sequences were analysed for HCV genotype determination by genotype-specific PCR; and then by cloning and direct sequencing followed by phylogenetic analysis. The sequences were further analysed in detail by similarity plotting.ResultsMolecular diagnosis confirmed the presence of HCV RNA in 2 out of 200 (1%) blood donors. Initial genotyping by genotype-specific PCR identified all two infections as subtypes 2a and 2b of genotype 2. Extensive evolutionary and genetic analyses indicated two epidemiological profiles. First, phylogenetic tree topologies clearly showed that, collectively, the core sequences of the Ghanaian HCV isolates belong to a single, distinct genetic group within HCV genotype 2 cluster, with high genetic similarity and rapid sequence variation in a single individual. Second, the sequences are mosaics comprising 2e and other genotype 2 subtype fragments. The analyses underscore a unique and complex HCV genotype 2 core sequence profile of the Ghanaian isolates.ConclusionsAnalysis of HCV core encoding sequences from Ghanaian blood donors in Accra confirmed predominance of genotype 2 HCV among healthy individuals. However, the isolates could not be classified into subtypes, possibly due to their complex sequence pattern that might suggest high mutability of the prevailing genotype. The core region of Ghanaian HCV therefore may not be suitable for distinguishing subtypes. These findings extend those from previous studies and thus underscore the need to search for subtype-informative region of Ghanaian HCV to elucidate the genetic diversity and factors determining outcome of HCV infections in Ghana.

DE Cuba; South Africa; Medical education; Mixed methods; Primary health

ID EDUCATION; HEALTH
AB BackgroundAchieving universal health care coverage will require greater investment in primary health care, particularly in rural and underserved populations in low and middle-income countries. South Africa has invested in training black students from disadvantaged backgrounds in Cuba and large numbers of these Cuban-trained students are now returning for final year and internship training in South Africa. There is controversy about the scheme, the quality and relevance of training received and the place of Cuban-trained doctors in the health care system. Exploring the experiences of Cuban- and South African-trained students, recent graduates and medical school faculty may help understand and resolve the current controversy.MethodsUsing a mixed methods approach, in-depth interviews and a focus group discussion were held with deans of medical schools, senior faculty, and Cuban-trained and South African-trained students and recent graduates. An online structured questionnaire, adapted from the USA medical student survey, was developed and administered to Cuban- and South African-trained students and recent graduates.ResultsSouth African students trained in Cuba have had beneficial experiences which orientate them towards primary health care and prevention. Their subsequent training in South Africa is intended to fill skill gaps related to TB, HIV and major trauma. However this training is ad hoc and variable in duration and demoralizing for some students. Cuban-trained students have stronger aspirations than those trained in South Africa to work in rural and underserved communities from which many of them are drawn.ConclusionAttempts to assimilate returning Cuban-trained students will require a reframing of the current negative narrative by focusing on positive aspects of their training, orientation towards primary care and public health, and their aspirations to work in rural and under-served urban areas. Cuban-trained doctors could be part of the solution to South Africa's health workforce problems.

AB BackgroundInternet addiction (IA) has emerged as a public health concern, particularly among adolescents and young adults. However, few studies have been conducted in medical students. This multi-center study aimed to investigate the prevalence of IA in Chinese medical students, to examine the associations of big five personality traits with IA in the population, and to explore the possible mediating role of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in the relationship.MethodsSelf-reported questionnaires, including Internet Addiction Test (IAT), Big Five Inventory (BFI), Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale-V1.1 (ASRS-V1.1) Screener, and socio-demographic section were distributed to clinical students at 3 medical schools in China. A total of 1264 students became the final subjects.ResultsThe overall prevalence of IA among Chinese medical students was 44.7% (IAT>30), and 9.2% of the students demonstrated moderate or severe IA (IAT50). After adjustment for covariates, while conscientiousness and agreeableness were negatively associated with IA, neuroticism was positively associated with it. ADHD symptoms mediated the associations of conscientiousness, agreeableness and neuroticism with IA.ConclusionThe prevalence of IA among Chinese medical students is high. Both personality traits and ADHD symptoms should be considered when tailored intervention strategies are designed to prevent and reduce IA in medical students.

AB BackgroundPoultry farming is widely practiced by rural households in Vietnam and the vast majority of domestic birds are kept on small household farms. However, smallholder poultry production is constrained by several issues such as infectious diseases, including avian influenza viruses whose circulation remains a threat to public health. This observational study describes the demographic structure and dynamics of small-scale poultry farms of the Mekong river delta region.MethodFifty three farms were monitored over a 20-month period, with farm sizes, species, age, arrival/departure of poultry, and farm management practices recorded monthly.ResultsMedian flock population sizes were 16 for chickens (IQR: 10-40), 32 for ducks (IQR: 18-101) and 11 for Muscovy ducks (IQR: 7-18); farm size distributions for the three species were heavily right-skewed. Muscovy ducks were kept for long periods and outdoors, while chickens and ducks were farmed indoors or in pens. Ducks had a markedly higher removal rate (broilers: 0.14/week; layer/breeders: 0.05/week) than chickens and Muscovy ducks (broilers: 0.07/week; layer/breeders: 0.01-0.02/week) and a higher degree of specialization resulting in a substantially shorter life span. The rate of mortality due to disease did not differ much among species, with birds being less likely to die from disease at older ages, but frequency of disease symptoms differed by species. Time series of disease-associated mortality were correlated with population size for Muscovy ducks (Kendall's coefficient =0.49, p-value <0.01) and with frequency of outdoor grazing for ducks (=0.33, p-value=0.05).ConclusionThe study highlights some challenges to disease control in small-scale multispecies poultry farms. The rate of interspecific contact and overlap between flocks of different ages is high, making small-scale farms a suitable environment for pathogens circulation. Muscovy ducks are farmed outdoors with little investment in biosecurity and few inter-farm movements. Ducks and chickens are more at-risk of introduction of pathogens through movements of birds from one farm to another. Ducks are farmed in large flocks with high turnover and, as a result, are more vulnerable to disease spread and require a higher vaccination coverage to maintain herd immunity.

AB BackgroundAlthough patients in Germany are generally free to choose their primary healthcare provider, this role should mainly be assumed by general practitioners (GPs). While some predictors of the frequency of use of GP services have been reported in international studies, there is still a lack in knowledge what could deter people from contacting a GP in Germany. To improve healthcare, it is important to identify characteristics of people without a GP.MethodsThis cross-sectional analysis was based on the first wave of the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults (DEGS1) conducted by the Robert Koch Institute in 2008-2011. Descriptive analyses and multiple logistic regression by gender were performed to analyze the association between having no GP and age, gender, residential area, socioeconomic status (SES), marital status, working hours per week, general state of health, chronic diseases and health insurance.ResultsOverall, 9.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 8.4-10.7) of the 7755 participants stated to have no GP, more often men (11.4%) than women (7.6%). Life in urban areas (big cities vs. rural: adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.9, 95% CI: 2.1-3.9), younger age (18-29years vs. 65-79years: aOR: 4.4, 95% CI: 2.5-7.7) and the presence of chronic diseases (yes vs. no: aOR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.3-0.6) showed significant associations of not having a GP. For men, the type of health insurance (private vs. statutory: aOR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.5-3.0; other vs. statutory: aOR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.4-3.1) and for women, SES (low vs. medium: aOR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2-2.7; high vs. medium: aOR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.4-3.0) increased the risk of having no GP.ConclusionsOur analysis offers new insights into the use of GPs in Germany and revealed differences between men and women. Public health strategies regarding access to a GP have to focus on men and on women with a low SES. Further analyses are needed to determine whether men with private health insurance prefer to consult a specialist rather than a GP. For young adults, improving the transition process from a pediatrician to a GP could fill a gap in health care.

AB BackgroundMigrants and refugees have important health needs and face inequalities in their health status. Health care delivery to this patient group has become a challenging public health focus in high income countries. This paper summarizes current knowledge on health care delivery to migrants and refugees in high-income countries from multiple perspectives.MethodsWe performed a systematic literature review including primary source qualitative and quantitative studies between 2000 and 2017. Articles were excluded if the study setting was in low- or middle-income countries or focused on skilled migration. Quality assessment was done for qualitative and quantitative studies separately. Predefined variables were extracted in a standardized form. Authors were approached to provide missing information.ResultsOf 185 identified articles, 35 were included in the final analysis. We identified three main topics of challenges in health care delivery: communication, continuity of care and confidence. All but one study included at least one of the three main topics and in 21/35 (60%) all three topics were mentioned. We further developed the 3C model and elaborated the interrelatedness of the three topics. Additional topics identified showed that the specific regional context with legal, financial, geographical and cultural aspects is important and further influences the 3C model.ConclusionsThe 3C model gives a simple and comprehensive, patient-centered summary of key challenges in health care delivery for refugees and migrants. This concept is relevant to support clinicians in their day to day practice and in guiding stakeholders in priority setting for refugee and migrant health policies.

AB BackgroundZika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne arbovirus that can produce serious public health consequences. In 2016, ZIKV caused an epidemic in many countries around the world, including the United States. ZIKV surveillance and vector control is essential to combating future epidemics. However, challenges relating to the timely publication of case reports significantly limit the effectiveness of current surveillance methods. In many countries with poor infrastructure, established systems for case reporting often do not exist. Previous studies investigating the H1N1 pandemic, general influenza and the recent Ebola outbreak have demonstrated that time- and geo-tagged Twitter data, which is immediately available, can be utilized to overcome these limitations.MethodsIn this study, we employed a recently developed system called Cloudberry to filter a random sample of Twitter data to investigate the feasibility of using such data for ZIKV epidemic tracking on a national and state (Florida) level. Two auto-regressive models were calibrated using weekly ZIKV case counts and zika tweets in order to estimate weekly ZIKV cases 1 week in advance.ResultsWhile models tended to over-predict at low case counts and under-predict at extreme high counts, a comparison of predicted versus observed weekly ZIKV case counts following model calibration demonstrated overall reasonable predictive accuracy, with an R-2 of 0.74 for the Florida model and 0.70 for the U.S. model. Time-series analysis of predicted and observed ZIKV cases following internal cross-validation exhibited very similar patterns, demonstrating reasonable model performance. Spatially, the distribution of cumulative ZIKV case counts (local- & travel-related) and zika tweets across all 50U.S. states showed a high correlation (r=0.73) after adjusting for population.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates the value of utilizing Twitter data for the purposes of disease surveillance. This is of high value to epidemiologist and public health officials charged with protecting the public during future outbreaks.

AB In 2010, the rare OP354-like P[8]b rotavirus subtype was detected in children less than 2 years old in Ghana. In this follow-up study, to provide insight into the evolutionary history of the genome of Ghanaian P[8]b strains RVA/Human-wt/GHA/GHDC949/2010/G9P[8] and RVA/Human-wt/GHA/GHM0094/2010/G9P[8] detected in an infant and a 7-month old child hospitalised for acute gastroenteritis, we sequenced the complete genome using both Sanger sequencing and Illumina MiSeq technology followed by phylogenetic analysis of the near-full length sequences. Both strains possessed the Wa-like/genotype 1 constellation G9P[8]b-I1-R1-C1-M1-A1-N1-T1-E1-H1. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic inference showed that both strains were identical at the lineage level throughout the 11 genome segments. Their VP7 sequences belonged to the major sub-lineage of the G9-lineage III whereas their VP4 sequences belonged to P[8]b cluster I. The VP7 and VP4 genes of the study strains were closely related to a Senegalese G9P[8]b strain detected in 2009. In the remaining nine genome segments, both strains consistently clustered together with Wa-like RVA strains possessing either P[8]a or P[8]b mostly of African RVA origin. The introduction of a P[8]b subtype VP4 gene into the stable Wa-like strain backbone may result in strains that might propagate easily in the human population, with a potential to become an important public health concern, especially because it is not certain if the monovalent rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix) used in Ghana will be efficacious against such strains. Our analysis of the full genomes of GHM0094 and GHDC949 adds to knowledge of the genetic make-up and evolutionary dynamics of P[8]b rotavirus strains.

TI Health system capacity in Sydney, Australia in the event of a biological
   attack with smallpox
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PUBLIC-HEALTH; EBOLA; VACCINATION; OUTBREAKS
AB Planning for a re-emergent epidemic of smallpox requires surge capacity of space, resources and personnel within health systems. There are many uncertainties in such a scenario, including likelihood and size of an attack, speed of response and health system capacity. We used a model for smallpox transmission to determine requirements for hospital beds, contact tracing and health workers (HCWs) in Sydney, Australia, during a modelled epidemic of smallpox. Sensitivity analysis was done on attack size, speed of response and proportion of case isolation and contact tracing. We estimated 100638 clinical HCWs and 14595 public hospital beds in Sydney. Rapid response, case isolation and contact tracing are influential on epidemic size, with case isolation more influential than contact tracing. With 95% of cases isolated, outbreak control can be achieved within 100 days even with only 50% of contacts traced. However, if case isolation and contact tracing both fall to 50%, epidemic control is lost. With a smaller initial attack and a response commencing 20 days after the attack, health system impacts are modest. The requirement for hospital beds will vary from up to 4% to 100% of all available beds in best and worst case scenarios. If the response is delayed, or if the attack infects 10000 people, all available beds will be exceeded within 40 days, with corresponding surge requirements for clinical health care workers (HCWs). We estimated there are 330 public health workers in Sydney with up to 940,350 contacts to be traced. At least 3 million respirators will be needed for the first 100 days. To ensure adequate health system capacity, rapid response, high rates of case isolation, excellent contact tracing and vaccination, and protection of HCWs should be a priority. Surge capacity must be planned. Failures in any of these could cause health system failure, with inadequate beds, quarantine spaces, personnel, PPE and inability to manage other acute health conditions.

AB The primary objective of this review is to investigate what is currently known about early childhood education planning, population health models and their relation to children's development. A systematic review using the Critical Interpretive Synthesis method was undertaken, guided by a preliminary research question, "How can a population heath approach be applied to educational planning to support children's early development?" which acted as a compass and guide throughout the process. The initial search yielded 20,122 results, of which 42 were included in the review. Four synthetic constructs emerged (1) Elements of population health models exist within communities and can help improve outcomes for more children, (2) Inter-disciplinary collaboration and partnerships possess unique opportunities to influence children's development, (3) Children's development can be influenced at a variety of levels, and (4) System change requires a range of drivers and supports. Within education, there are several models which are used to improve outcomes for children and families. Although a population health approach to planning does not explicitly exist, the results from this review indicate that it would indeed be plausible to adapt the population health approach to sites and schools, and that doing so would be advantageous for children's development. However, implementing such an approach requires more than desire for change and demands system changes and supports. A protocol for the review was published on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), registration number CRD42018098835 on 31st July 2018.

AB Background
   Lead, mercury, cadmium and arsenic are the priority heavy metals of major public health concern in industrialized countries. Exposure to them can cause cognitive impairment and depressive disorders through an effect on Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which is an important biomarker of pregnancy. Despite a number of prior studies on heavy metals pollution, there is few of studies on the effect of heavy metals on BDNF during early pregnancy. This study aims to examine the association between maternal blood heavy metals concentrations and BDNF during the first trimester pregnancy among Myanmar migrants in Thailand.
   Methodology
   This cross sectional study, a part of ongoing birth cohort was conducted at the antenatal care clinic from June to October 2018. A total of 108 with Myanmar migrant pregnancy with a single viable fetus of 0 to 14 gestation weeks who stayed within the industrial plant at least 3 months before were recruited. Socio-demographic characteristics and health behaviors were accessed using a self-report questionnaire. Maternal blood heavy metals (lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As)) were measured using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer and plasma BDNF was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Multivariate binary logistic regression were modeled to access the association.
   Results
   Median (interquartile rank: IQR) concentrations were: BDNF (6.49 (1.79) mu g/ml), Pb (2.77 (1.46) mu g/dL), Hg (0.62 (0.54) mu g/dL), Cd (0.93(0.86) mu g/L) and As (0.40 (0.11) mu g/dL) respectively. We categorized BDNF concentrations into high (>median) (n = 54) and low (. median) (n = 54) groups. After adjusting for potential confounders, high blood total arsenic concentration had 2.6-fold increased odds (aOR = 2.603, 95% CI: 1.178, 5.751) of low plasma BDNF level as compared with low blood total arsenic group. However, there was no significant association between BDNF and Pb, Hg and Cd.
   Conclusions
   The present findings demonstrate higher blood total arsenic level were more likely to have lower BDNF in early pregnancy. Our study suggested that heavy metal could be worsen BDNF level which plays its important role on biological effect of maternal depressive disorder and newborn neurodevelopment.

AB BackgroundRape, unintended pregnancy, and abortion are among the most controversial and stigmatized topics facing sexual and reproductive health researchers, advocates, and the public today. Over the past three decades, public health practicioners and human rights advocates have made great strides to advance our understanding of sexual and reproductive rights and how they should be protected. The overall aim of the study was to understand young women's personal experiences of unintended pregnancy in the context of Nicaragua's repressive legal and sociocultural landscape. Ten in-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted with women ages 16-23 in a city in North Central Nicaragua, from June to July 2014.Case presentationThis case study focuses on the story of a 19-year-old Nicaraguan woman who was raped, became pregnant, and almost died from complications resultingfrom an unsafe abortion. Her case, detailed under the pseudonym Ana Maria, presents unique challenges related to the fulfillment of sexual and reproductive rights due to the restrictive social norms related to sexual health, ubiquitous violence against women (VAW) and the total ban on abortion in Nicaragua. The case also provides a useful lens through which to examine individual sexual and reproductive health (SRH) experiences, particularly those of rape, unintended pregnancy, and unsafe abortion; this in-depth analysis identifies the contextual risk factors that contributed to Ana Maria's experience.ConclusionsFar too many women experience their sexuality in the context of individual and structural violence. Ana Maria's case provides several important lessons for the realization of sexual and reproductive health and rights in countries with restrictive legal policies and conservative cultural norms around sexuality. Ana Maria's experience demonstrates that an individual's health decisions are not made in isolation, free from the influence of social norms and national laws. We present an overview of the key risk and contextual factors that contributed to Ana Maria's experienceof violence, unintended pregnancy, and unsafe abortion.

AB BackgroundHantaviruses are important zoonotic pathogens, and they pose a profound risk to public health. So far, there has been no evidence showing that Tula virus (TULV), one species of hantavirus, is endemic in China. In this study, we captured rodents and found that the Tula virus had infected voles in Yili region, Xinjiang, China.MethodsRodents were captured by flooding their burrows in mountain pasture areas in Narati, Xinyuan County, Xinjiang, China. Hantavirus L gene fragments were amplified by nest RT-PCR using genus-specific primers. Positive samples were further identified by sequencing of RT-PCR products of S gene fragment for species identification. To identify the species of captured small mammals, the rodents' cytochrome b (Cytb) was amplified by PCR and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis was used to show the clustering and evolution relationship of the viral nucleic acids.ResultsHere, 31 out of 198 voles captured (16%) were infected with TULV. Host sequencing analysis showed these voles were Microtus obscurus (M. obscurs). Alignment and phylogenetic analysis of the exon region (1191bp) of the hantavirus S gene confirmed that all of the detected amplicons were TULV, which was similar to one strain of TULV identified in Kazakhstan.ConclusionThis is the first identification of Tula virus in China, and we found that M. obscurus acts as a natural reservoir for carrying the virus. Although the infection rate in the local human population remains unknown, the high prevalence of TULV in the small mammals in the region constitutes a risk that this putative pathogen may spread to the local population.

AB BackgroundAccurate measurement of health literacy is essential to improve accessibility and effectiveness of health care and prevention. One measure frequently applied in international research is the Short Assessment of Health Literacy (SAHL). While the Dutch SAHL (SAHL-D) has proven to be valid and reliable, its administration is time consuming and burdensome for participants. Our aim was to further validate, strengthen and shorten the SAHL-D using Rasch analysis.MethodsAvailable cross-sectional SAHL-D data was used from adult samples (N=1231) to assess unidimensionality, local independence, item fit, person fit, item hierarchy, scale targeting, precision (person reliability and person separation), and presence of differential item functioning (DIF) depending on age, gender, education and study sample.ResultsThirteen items for a short form were selected based on item fit and DIF, and scale properties were compared between the two forms. The long form had several items with DIF for age, gender, educational level and study sample. Both forms showed lower measurement precision at higher health literacy levels.ConclusionsThe findings support the validity and reliability of the SAHL-D for the long form and the short form, which can be used for a rapid assessment of health literacy in research and clinical practice.

AB BackgroundOral problems, known as a neglected epidemic, have become prevalent in Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) countries in last decade. The objective of the study is to examine the prevalence and associated risk indicators of oral problems in adults in the Russian Federation, India, and China in BRICS countries.MethodsWe used data from the first round of the Study of Global AGEing and Adult Health (SAGE), conducted by WHO in 2007-10 in selected BRICS countries. Oral problems are defined as if an adult had any mouth and/or teeth related problems including swallowing problems in last 1 year of the survey. We estimated the mean age of adults who had oral problems and used a t-test for comparing it by sex of adults. We determined the prevalence of oral problems in adults. We designed a hierarchical conceptual model to identify associated risk indicators with oral problems. Finally, we applied a multivariable binary logistic regression model based on a conceptual model to examine associated socioeconomic and demographic, behavioral and nutritional risk indicators and systemic diseases - diabetes, hypertension, and angina pectoris/angina with oral problems in adults.ResultsThe mean age of adults who had oral problems is lowest in India (57years; SD: 15) and highest in China (65years; SD: 11). However, it does not vary by sex of adults except India. The prevalence of oral problems is highest in the Russian Federation (35%) and lowest in China (9%). Adults with body mass index (BMI) less than 25kg/m(2), age 45years or more, diabetes, hypertension, and angina pectoris/angina have a higher risk of oral problems. Females and adults using alcohol are also more likely to have oral problems in selected countries.ConclusionsThe study concludes that females, adults using alcohol and those having any systemic disease are at higher risk of oral problems in the Russian Federation, India, and China. A one-third of adults had oral problems in particularly, in the Russian Federation; thus there is an urgent need to formulate oral policy and program, which the country currently lacks in.

ID ATTITUDES
AB BackgroundDentists, who advocate for Community Water Fluoridation (CWF), can help decrease the dental caries disparity gap between low and high socioeconomic groups. Advocating for CWF, a cause that promotes oral health at the population level is an altruistic behavior. Dentists who accept and provide services to Medicaid-insured children, who are from low socioeconomic backgrounds, are also considered altruistic. We tested the association between accepting new Medicaid-insured children every month, and willingness to advocate for CWF programs in pediatric dentists (PDs).MethodsIn 2016, a 22-item pilot tested online survey was sent to 5394 PD members of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry. Descriptive analysis and a multiple adjusted logistic regression model was conducted.ResultsDentists who accept new Medicaid-insured children every month (OR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.06-2.47; p=0.02) were more willing to advocate for CWF compared to their counterparts. Those practicing primarily in rural (OR=4.67; 95% CI: 1.82-11.9; p=0.001), and urban areas (OR=2.27; 95%CI: 1.05-4.89; p=0.04), and those willing to promote fluoridated water consumption to parents in the clinic (OR=3.40; 95% CI: 1.87-6.21; p=<0.0001) were significantly more likely to be willing to advocate for CWF. PDs trained in public health advocacy during pediatric residency alone (OR=2.37; 95% CI: 1.24-4.51; p=0.009), or during both pre-doctoral dental education and pediatric residency (OR=3.51; 95% CI: 1.87-5.6; p=<0.0001) were more willing to advocate for CWF compared to their counterparts.ConclusionsPDs who accepted new Medicaid-insured children every month were more willing to advocate for CWF programs compared to those who did not.

AB BackgroundGlobally, alcohol use is responsible for 320 deaths every hour, and the impact is more among those in the younger age group. Despite the adverse health and social challenges associated with alcohol use, alcohol remains the most used and abused psychoactive substance among young adults. Our study aimed at determining the prevalence, correlates and frequency of alcohol use among young adults in two Nigerian universities. We further explored the role of family structure, family support and religion/religiosity on alcohol use in this study setting. Such findings could help to inform public health policy formulation in the country.MethodsThis was a cross-sectional study conducted in two selected universities in the North Central region of Nigeria. The study was conducted among a final sample of 784 students selected using stratified random sampling. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data on ever and current alcohol use and frequency of alcohol use between February and April 2018. The data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics.ResultsThe level of ever and current use of alcohol was 43.5 and 31.1%, respectively. The mean frequency of alcohol use among the study participants was three days, but ten days among current alcohol users. In the adjusted model, male sex, age above 19years, infrequent attendance of religious rituals, and belonging to rich/middle-class family were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of ever use and current use of alcohol, while living in the same household as one's father was associated with lower odds of current and ever use of alcohol.ConclusionThere is a high rate of lifetime and current use of alcohol among university students in the study setting. Alcohol use was significantly associated with living with parents, religion and religiosity. Both high and low socioeconomic status were associated with alcohol use. There is a need to implement measures in controlling alcohol manufacturing and marketing as well as policies regulating alcohol outlets establishment around educational institutions as well as the working hours in such outlets. Finally, there is a need to organise interventions aimed at reducing this unhealthy social norm among students in this setting.

AB Background1Little is known of the extent of workplace bullying in Malaysia, despite its growing recognition worldwide as a serious public health issue in the workplace. Workplace bullying is linked to stress-related health issues, as well as socioeconomic consequences which may include absenteeism due to sick days and unemployment. We sought to examine the prevalence of workplace bullying and its association with socioeconomic factors and psychological distress in a large observational study of Malaysian employees.MethodsThis study employed cross-sectional, self-reported survey methodology. We used the 6-item Kessler screening scale (K6) to assess psychological distress (cutoff score13, range 0-24, with higher scores indicating greater psychological distress). Participants self-reported their perceptions of whether they had been bullied at work and how frequently this occurred. A multivariate logistic regression was conducted with ever bullying and never bullying as dichotomous categories.ResultsThere were a total of 5235 participants (62.3% female). Participant ages ranged from 18 to 85, meanstandard deviation (M +/- SD): 33.88 +/- 8.83. A total of 2045 (39.1%) participants reported ever being bullied. Of these, 731 (14.0%) reported being subject to at least occasional bullying, while another 194 (3.7%) reported it as a common occurrence. Across all income strata, mean scores for psychological distress were significantly higher for ever bullied employees (M +/- SD: 8.69 +/- 4.83) compared to those never bullied (M +/- SD: 5.75 +/- 4.49). Regression analysis indicated significant associations (p<0.001) between workplace bullying with being female (Adjusted OR (aOR)=1.27, 95% CI 1.12-1.44), higher individual income levels of between RM4,000 to RM7,999 (aOR =1.24, 95% CI 1.06-1.45) and RM8,000 and above (aOR=1.31, 95% CI 1.10-1.56), and psychological distress (aOR=1.15, 95% CI 1.13-1.16).Conclusions More than one in three employees reported having experienced workplace bullying, which was found to be specifically associated with being female, drawing a higher income, and greater psychological distress. In general, low individual income was associated with greater psychological distress. However, higher income employees were far more likely to report experiencing workplace bullying. Findings from this study offer relevant insight into the associations between socioeconomic status and psychological distress in workplace bullying.

AB BackgroundRural coastal communities in Sabah are still overly represented in the hardcore poor economic status. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia among adults, in relation to economic status.MethodsA cross-sectional study using stratified random sampling was conducted in seven coastal villages in Semporna, Sabah: Kabogan Laut, Salimbangun, Pekalangan, Pokas, Tampi-Tampi Timbayan, Sum Sum and Selinggit. Socio-demographic data were obtained via interviewer administered questionnaires in Sabah Malay creole. Anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose and blood lipids were obtained.ResultsA total of 330 adults (133 males, 197 females) completed the study. Mean age was 43.715.8years. Most participants (87%) were living below the Poverty Line Income. Median per capita household income was RM83.33/month (approximate to USD20/month). The number of newly diagnosed cases of hypercholesterolemia was 40.6%, diabetes mellitus was 5.8%, and hypertension was 24.5%. Adults from the hardcore poor economic status (household income RM760/month (approximate to USD183/month) were the most represented in those who did not have a blood pressure, blood sugar and blood lipids check in the 12months preceding the study ((2), p<0.01). Adults from hardcore poor economic status were also the most represented in undiagnosed hypertension and uncontrolled blood pressure among those diagnosed ((2), p=0.013). Among diabetics from the hardcore poor group, the undiagnosed fasting blood glucose was 11.2 +/- 4.5 compared to 5.1 +/- 0.6mmol/L for diagnosed diabetics (p<0.001). Among hypercholesterolemics from the hardcore poor group, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol values were significantly higher in the undiagnosed group compared to the diagnosed group (p<0.001).Conclusion Many people in this rural coastal community were unaware that they had high cholesterol level (40.6%) and elevated blood pressure (24.5%). Routine health check is not common among low income adults in rural coastal communities in Semporna. The findings suggest public health initiatives should emphasize access to and the necessity of routine health checks for those aged 40years.

AB BackgroundIncreased global urbanisation has led to public health challenges. Community gardens are identified as a mechanism for addressing socio-ecological determinants of health. This study aims to explore motives for joining community gardens, and the extent to which participation can be facilitated given barriers and enablers to community gardening. Such a study fills a gap in the public health literature, particularly in the Australian context.MethodsThis paper presents findings from semi-structured interviews with 23 participants from 6 community gardens across Melbourne. Applying phenomenological, epistemological and reflexive methodologies and thematic analysis of the data, this study provides a snapshot of drivers of community garden participation.ResultsResults were categorised into six enabling themes to participation. These themes revolved around (i) family history, childhood and passion for gardening; (ii) productive gardening, sustainability and growing fresh produce in nature; (iii) building social and community connections; (iv) community and civic action; (v) stress relief; and (vi) building identity, pride and purpose. Time costs incurred, garden governance and vandalism of garden spaces were among the barriers to community garden participation.ConclusionAlthough an interest in the act of gardening itself may be universally present among community gardeners to varying degrees, the findings of this study suggest that motivations for participation are diverse and span a range of ancestral, social, environmental, and political domains. This study contributes exploratory insights on community garden motivations and sustained involvement across multiple urban sites in Melbourne (Australia). This study recommends extending this work by undertaking future quantitative research that can move from local case studies to a national guidelines on how to engage more people in urban agriculture activities like community gardening.

AB BackgroundInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was once considered as a Western disease. However, recent epidemiological data showed an emerging trend of IBD cases in the Eastern Asia countries. Clinico-epidemiological data of IBD in Malaysia is scarce. This study aimed to address this issue.MethodsRetrospective analysis of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), diagnosed from January 1980 till June 2018 was conducted at our centre.ResultsA total of 413 IBD patients (281 UC, 132 CD) were identified. Mean crude incidence of IBD has increased steadily over the first three decades: 0.36 (1980-1989), 0.48 (1990-1999) and 0.63 per 100,000 person-years (2000-2009). In the 2010 to 2018 period, the mean crude incidence has doubled to 1.46 per 100,000 person-years. There was a significant rise in the incidence of CD, as depicted by reducing UC:CD ratio: 5:1 (1980-1989), 5:1 (1990-1999), 1.9:1 (2000-2009) and 1.7:1 (2010-2018). The prevalence rate of IBD, UC and CD, respectively were 23.0, 15.67 and 7.36 per 100,000 persons. Of all IBD patients, 61.5% (n=254) were males. When stratified according to ethnic group, the highest prevalence of IBD was among the Indians: 73.4 per 100,000 persons, followed by Malays: 24.8 per 100,000 persons and Chinese: 14.6 per 100,000 persons. The mean age of diagnosis was 41.2years for UC and 27.4years for CD. Majority were non-smokers (UC: 76.9%, CD: 70.5%). The diseases were classified as follows: UC; proctitis (9.2%), left-sided colitis (50.2%) and extensive colitis (40.6%), CD; isolated ileal (22.7%), colonic (28.8%), ileocolonic (47.7%) and upper gastrointestinal (0.8%). 12.9% of CD patients had concurrent perianal disease. Extra intestinal manifestations were observed more in CD (53.8%) as compared to UC (12%). Dysplasia and malignancy, on the other hand, occurred more in UC (4.3%, n=12) than in CD (0.8%, n=1). Over one quarter (27.3%) of CD patients and 3.6% of UC patients received biologic therapy.ConclusionThe incidence of IBD is rising in Malaysia, especially in the last one decade. This might be associated with the urbanization and changing diets. Public and clinicians' awareness of this emerging disease in Malaysia is important for the timely detection and management.

AB BackgroundThe risk factors of ischemic heart disease (IHD) specific for women are less well studied. However, knowing the risk factors of IHD for women will empower women themselves to be better informed and thus can help them in decision making concerning their health condition. The objective of this study is to explore the commonly studied risk factors of ischemic heart disease (IHD) among a group of Malaysian women.MethodsA case control study was conducted among 142 newly diagnosed IHD women patients registered in government hospitals in Terengganu, Malaysia and their 1:1 frequency matched population controls. Data on sociodemographic and socioeconomic profile, co-morbidities, lifestyle factors related to physical activities, dietary fat intake, stress, passive smoking history, anthropometric measurements and biochemical markers were obtained.ResultsMiddle aged women were recruited with women diagnosed with diabetes (aOR=1.92, 95% CI: 1.11-3.31), having low HDL-C (aOR=3.30, 95% CI: 1.28-8.27), those with positive family history of IHD (aOR=1.92, 95% CI:1.13-3.26) and passive smokers (aOR=2.99, 95% CI:1.81-4.94) were at higher odds of IHD.ConclusionsThe findings are useful for public health interventions and policy making focusing on specific women population.

AB BackgroundFood away from home (FAFH) in the US is associated with adverse health outcomes, and food dollars spent on FAFH continues to increase. FAFH studies have typically focused on restaurants and carryout establishments, but mobile food vendors - popularly known in the US as food trucks - have become more numerous and are an understudied segment of FAFH. The objective of this study was to assess mobile food vendors, their attitudes toward health and nutrition, and the foods they serve.MethodsThis was a cross-sectional study of 41 mobile food vendors in Michigan, US. The survey contained questions about food and nutrition attitudes, such as barriers to putting healthy items on menus and perceived agreement with healthy food preparation practices. Participants were classified into a healthy and a less healthy attitude group based on whether they believed healthy menu items could be successful or not. In addition, participant menus were collected and analyzed according to whether menu items were healthy, moderately healthy, or unhealthy. Descriptive, univariate, and bivariate analyses were conducted.ResultsTwo-thirds of the participants felt that healthy menu items could be successful, and yet taste and value were the most important menu item success factors, each rated as important by 100% of the participants. Low consumer demand was the biggest barrier to putting healthy items on the menu (76%) whereas lack of chef interest (29%) and need for special training (24%) were the smallest. 72% of the vendors offered at least one healthy menu item, but only 20% of all reviewed menu items were healthy overall. There was no difference in the proportion of menu items that were healthy when comparing those with healthy attitudes (23% of menu items healthy) to those less healthy attitudes (17% of menu items healthy, p=0.349).ConclusionsMobile food vendors had positive views about putting healthy items on menus. However, a low proportion of menu items were classified as healthy. This suggests that mobile food vendors are promising potential public health partners in improving the health profile of FAFH, but that education of vendors is needed to ensure the success of healthier items.

AB BackgroundThe European school-based drug addiction prevention program Unplugged was adapted to the Brazilian context by the Ministry of Health and renamed #Tamojunto. Its first implementations, in the form of a public policy in Brazil, showed contradictory and different effects from those observed in Europe. Adaptations were made to #Tamojunto in 2018 to reintroduce the essential content of the original program.MethodsA parallel, two-arm, randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the new version of the school-based government program #Tamojunto2.0 for the prevention of drug use among 8th grade middle school students from 70 public schools in three Brazilian cities, totaling approximately 6.300 participating students distributed in 210 classes. For intervention, the experimental group will receive the 12 lessons of the #Tamojunto2.0 program under the supervision of a Brazilian Ministry of Health team. The control group will not receive any intervention. Information will be collected from the students at three time points: preintervention and 9 and 18months postintervention. Multilevel analyses will be performed using the Gllamm Stata program to assess simultaneous differences in prevalence, in time and among groups for the outcomes of interest. Structural equation modeling will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in changing the behavioral patterns of the adolescents through latent transition analysis. The effect of the mediators involved in the program effectiveness outcomes will also be analyzed. The program doses applied in all classes of the intervention group will be collected using a form completed by the teacher at the end of each lesson, indicating the activities taught and not taught in each lesson.DiscussionThis study will show whether the #Tamojunto2.0 program can be expanded as a public policy for all schools with the aim of preventing drug use among Brazilian students.Trial registrationBrazilian Clinical Trials Registry (RBR-8cnkwq) under the name AvaliacAo do Efeito do Programa de PrevencAo Escolar ao Uso de Drogas #Tamojunto2.0, VersAo 2018, on August 30th, 2018 (http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/RBR-8cnkwq/).

AB The current issue of BMC Public Health presents work by the Consortium of Low Income Population Research (CB40R), highlighting a comprehensive aspect of health, i.e., physical health, mental health, health behaviour and health financing; and also nutrition involving all stages of lifespan of the socioeconomic deprived group in Malaysia.Consortium of B40 Research (CB40R) reposited and harmonised shared, non-identifiable data from epidemiological studies involving low income population (B40) in Malaysia. CB40R also performed joint or mega-analyses using combined, harmonised data sets that yield collated results with enhanced statistical power, more variabilities (study population, geographical regions, ethnicities and sociocultural groups) to better understand the needs, characteristics and issues of B40 groups in Malaysia. It also aimed to develope a system/framework of minimum/standard variables to be collected in research involving B40 in future. For this special issues, members of the consortium have been invited to contribute an original article involving analysis of the health aspects, access to health and nutritional issues of the B40 samples.All the papers in this special issue have successfully highlighted the health and nutritional issues (i.e., non-communicable disease (NCD), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), knowledge towards sexually transmitted disease (STD), low birth weight, Motoric Cognitive Risk (MCR) syndrome, urinary incontinence), mental health, oral health and inequalities among the low-income group in Malaysia, including the rural population and also the urban poor. The low-income population in Malaysia is also at risk of both under- and over nutrition, of which specific cost effective strategies are indeed needed to improve their quality of life.The low income population in Malaysia is facing various health challenges, particularly related to NCD and poor mental health, nutritional and physical function. There is a need for a sustainable intervention model to tackle the issues. It is also important to highlight that reducing SES disparities in health will require policy initiatives addressing the components of socioeconomic status (income, education, and occupation) as well as the pathways by which these affect health.

AB BackgroundInfection in healthcare facilities is a major public health problem in most developing countries like Ethiopia. Currently the overall incidence of health care associated infection has been increased and burden of these infections is staggering. This study aimed to assess health care workers compliance with standard precaution practices and associated factors in public health institutions of Dawuro zone, south west Ethiopia, 2016.MethodsAn institution based cross sectional study was conducted from February1-30/ 2016 in 17 health institutions found in Dawuro zone. Data were collected using a pre-tested questionnaire on 250 health care workers selected by simple random sampling technique. Collected data was checked, coded and analyzed by using SPSS version 20. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.ResultTwo hundred fifty health care workers were participated in the study. Out of the total respondents, 162(65.0%) of respondents had complied with standard precaution practices. Service year less than or equal to 5 years, training on standard precaution, having good hand hygiene and availability of personal protective equipment were independently associated with compliance to standard precaution practices.ConclusionSignificant numbers of health care workers were not complied with standard precaution practices in this study. Therefore strategies targeted in fulfilling health institutions with supplies like hand hygiene material, Personal Protective equipment and training on standard precaution will improve compliance with standard precaution practice.

ID DISEASES
AB BackgroundPrevious studies have shown limited availability of medicines in health facilities in Bangladesh. While medicines are dispensed for free in public facilities, they are paid out-of-pocket in private pharmacies. Availability, price and affordability are key concerns for access to medicines in Bangladesh.MethodsThe World Health Organization/Health Action International survey methodology was used to determine price, availability and affordability of 61 lowest price generic (LPG) and originator branded medicines in public facilities, private retail pharmacies and private clinics across 6 regions of Bangladesh. Medicines for non-communicable and infectious diseases, and both on and off the national Essential Medicines List were included. Prices were compared internationally using Median Price Ratio (MPR).ResultsMean LPG (originator brand) availability in the public sector, private retail pharmacies, and private clinics was 37%, 63 (4) percent, and 54 (2) percent, respectively. Medicines for Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) and essential medicines were significantly less available than infectious disease medicines and non-essential medicines, respectively.Mean LPG (originator brand) MPR was 0.977 in the public sector, 1.700 (3.698) in private retail pharmacies and 1.740 (3.758) in private clinics. Six medicines were expensive by international standards across all sectors.The least affordable treatments in both private sectors were bisoprolol (hypertension), metformin (diabetes) and atorvastatin (hypercholesterolemia).ConclusionAvailability and affordability of NCD medicines are key concerns where the burden of NCD is rising. These findings show improvement from earlier studies, but room for further advances in availability and affordability of NCD medicines in Bangladesh. A small number of medicines are consistently expensive across sectors in Bangladesh, suggesting the need for strategies to address prices for certain medicines.

ID RECOGNITION; INFORMATION; DEPRESSION; INTERVIEW
AB BackgroundWhen doctors have honest conversations with patients about their illness and involve them in decisions about their care, patients express greater satisfaction with care and lowered anxiety and depression. The Serious Illness Care Programme (the Programme), originally developed in the United States (U.S), promotes meaningful, realistic and focused conversations about patient's wishes, fears and worries for the future with their illness. The Serious Illness Conversation Guide (the guide) provides a framework to structure these conversations. The aim of this paper is to present findings from a study to examine the face validity', acceptability and relevance of the Guide for use within the United Kingdom (UK) health care setting.MethodsA multi-stage approach was undertaken, using three separate techniques: Nominal Group Technique with clinician expert groups' to review the Serious Illness Conversation Guide: 14 experts' in Oncology, Palliative Care and Communication Skills;Cognitive Interviews with 6 patient and public representatives, using the think aloud technique'; to explore the cognitive processes involved in answering the questions in the guide, including appropriateness of language, question wording and formatFinal stakeholder review and consensus.ResultsNominal Group TechniqueUnanimous agreement the conversation guide could provide a useful support to clinicians. Amendments are required but should be informed directly from the cognitive interviews. Training highlighted as key to underpin the use of the guide.Cognitive interviewsThe holistic' attention to the person as a whole was valued rather than a narrow focus on their disease. Some concern was raised regarding the formality' of some wording however and suggestions for amendments were made.Final stakeholder reviewStakeholders agreed amendments to 5/13 prompts and unanimously agreed the UK guide should be implemented as a part of the pilot implementation of the Serious Illness Care Programme UK.ConclusionUse of the guide has the potential to benefit patients, facilitating a person-centred' approach to these important conversations, and providing a framework to promote shared decision making and care planning. Further research is ongoing, to understand the impact of these conversations on patients, families and clinicians and on concordance of care delivery with expressed patient wishes.

DT Article
DE Leprosy; Antibodies; Children; Adolescents; Mycobacterium leprae
AB BackgroundLeprosy is is still considered a public health issue and in Colombia 7-10% of new cases are found in children, indicating both active transmission and social inequality. We hypothesized that circulating antibodies against Natural Octyl Disaccharide-Leprosy IDRI Diagnostic (NDO-LID) (a combination of Mycobacterium leprae antigens) could reveal the social and environmental aspects associated with higher frequencies of M. leprae infection among children and adolescents in Colombia.MethodsAn observational cross-sectional study was conducted involving sampling from 82 children and adolescents (younger than 18years of age) who had household contact with index leprosy patients diagnosed in the last 5years. Data were analyzed through bivariate analysis made by applying a Pearson x(2) test for qualitative variables, while quantitative variables, depending on their distribution, were analyzed using either a Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Multivariate analysis was performed using a multiple regression and binomial logistic approach.ResultsA bivariate analysis demonstrated that antibody titers against NDO-LID were significantly greater in children and adolescents with a low socioeconomic status that had: lived in vulnerable areas of the UAChR shared region; eaten armadillo meat; exposure of over 10years to an index case and; not received BCG immunization. Moreover, a multivariate analysis showed that residing in the UAChR region has a strong association with a greater possibility of M. leprae infection.ConclusionsM. leprae transmission persists among young Colombians, and this is associated with social and environmental conditions. An intensification of efforts to identify new leprosy cases in vulnerable and forgotten populations where M. leprae transmission continues therefore appears necessary.

ID SOUTH DARFUR
AB BackgroundArmed conflict in Darfur, west Sudan since 2003 has led to the influx of about 100 international humanitarian UN and non-governmental organizations to help the affected population. Many of their humanitarian interventions included the collection of human personal data and/or biosamples, and these activities are often associated with ethical issues. A systematic review was conducted to assess the proportion of publicly available online reports of the research activities undertaken on humans in Darfur between 2004 and 2012 that mention obtaining ethical approval and/or informed consent.MethodsThis systematic review is based on a systematic literature search of Complex Emergency Database, ReliefWeb, PubMed), followed by a hand search for the hardcopies of the eligible reports archived in the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) in Brussels.ResultsThe online search showed that out of the 68 eligible studies, 13.2% (9) reported gaining ethical approval and 42.6% (29) that an informed consent was obtained from the participants. The CRED search included 138 eligible reports. None of these reports mentioned gaining ethical approval and 17 (12.3%) mentioned obtaining informed consent from their participants.ConclusionsThe proportion of studies reporting ethical review and informed consent was smaller than might be expected, so we suggest five possible explanations for these findings. This review provides empirical evidence that can help in planning ethical conduct of research in humanitarian settings.

AB BackgroundPrisoners carry a greater burden of physical, communicable and psychiatric disease compared to the general population. Prison health care structures are complex and provide challenges and opportunities to engage a marginalised and poorly served group with health care including Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) screening, assessment and treatment. Optimising HCV management in prisons is a public health priority. Nurses are the primary healthcare providers in most prisons globally. Understanding the barriers and facilitators to prisoners engaging in HCV care from the perspectives of nurses is the first step in implementing effective strategies to eliminate HCV from prison settings. The aim of this study was to identify the barriers and facilitators to HCV screening and treatment in Irish prisons from a nurse perspective and inform the implementation of a national prison-based HCV screening program.MethodsA qualitative study using focus group methodology underpinned by grounded theory for analysis in a national group of nurse managers (n=12).ResultsThe following themes emerged from the analysis; security and safety requirements impacting patient access, staffing and rostering issues, prison nurses' skill set and concerns around phlebotomy, conflict between maintaining confidentiality and concerns for personal safety, peer workers, prisoners' lack of knowledge, fear of treatment and stigma, inter-prison variations in prisoner health needs and health service delivery and priority, linkage to care, timing of screening and stability of prison life.ConclusionsPrison nurses are uniquely placed to identify barriers and facilitators to HCV screening and treatment in prisoners and inform changes to health care practice and policy that will optimise the public health opportunity that incarceration provides.

AB Paratuberculosis, a chronic disease affecting ruminant livestock, is caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). It has direct and indirect economic costs, impacts animal welfare and arouses public health concerns. In a survey of 48 countries we found paratuberculosis to be very common in livestock. In about half the countries more than 20% of herds and flocks were infected with MAP. Most countries had large ruminant populations (millions), several types of farmed ruminants, multiple husbandry systems and tens of thousands of individual farms, creating challenges for disease control. In addition, numerous species of free-living wildlife were infected. Paratuberculosis was notifiable in most countries, but formal control programs were present in only 22 countries. Generally, these were the more highly developed countries with advanced veterinary services. Of the countries without a formal control program for paratuberculosis, 76% were in South and Central America, Asia and Africa while 20% were in Europe. Control programs were justified most commonly on animal health grounds, but protecting market access and public health were other factors. Prevalence reduction was the major objective in most countries, but Norway and Sweden aimed to eradicate the disease, so surveillance and response were their major objectives. Government funding was involved in about two thirds of countries, but operations tended to be funded by farmers and their organizations and not by government alone. The majority of countries (60%) had voluntary control programs. Generally, programs were supported by incentives for joining, financial compensation and/or penalties for non-participation. Performance indicators, structure, leadership, practices and tools used in control programs are also presented. Securing funding for long-term control activities was a widespread problem. Control programs were reported to be successful in 16 (73%) of the 22 countries. Recommendations are made for future control programs, including a primary goal of establishing an international code for paratuberculosis, leading to universal acknowledgment of the principles and methods of control in relation to endemic and transboundary disease. An holistic approach across all ruminant livestock industries and long-term commitment is required for control of paratuberculosis.

TI Demographic risk factors for adverse birth outcomes in Puerto Rico in
   the PROTECT cohort
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PREGNANT-WOMEN; GESTATIONAL-AGE; VARIABILITY; TRENDS
AB Preterm birth is a major public health problem, especially in Puerto Rico where the rates are among the highest observed worldwide, reaching 18% in 2011. The Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) study is an ongoing investigation of environmental factors that contribute to this condition. In the present analysis, we sought to examine common risk factors for preterm birth and other adverse birth outcomes which have not been characterized previously in this unique population. Pregnant women from the PROTECT cohort are recruited from the heavily contaminated Northern coast of the island of Puerto Rico and are free of pre-existing conditions like diabetes. We examined associations between basic demographic, behavioral (e.g., tobacco and alcohol use), and pregnancy (e.g., season and year of delivery) characteristics as well as municipality of residence in relation to preterm birth (< 37 weeks gestation), postterm birth (>= 41 weeks gestation), and small and large for gestational age in univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. Between 2011 and 2017, 1028 live singleton births were delivered as part of the PROTECT cohort. Of these, 107 (10%) were preterm. Preterm birth rates were higher among women with low socioeconomic status, as indicated by education level and income, and among women with high pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI). Odds ratios of small for gestational age delivery were higher for women who reported tobacco use in pregnancy and lower for women who delivered in the hurricane and dengue season (July-October). Overall, in pregnant women residing in Puerto Rico, socioeconomic status was associated with preterm birth but few other factors were associated with this or other adverse outcomes of pregnancy. Research to understand environmental factors that could be contributing to the preterm birth epidemic in Puerto Rico is necessary.

TI "I can't read and don't understand": Health literacy and health
   messaging about folic acid for neural tube defect prevention in a
   migrant population on the Myanmar-Thailand border
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID COMMUNITY; KNOWLEDGE; THASONGYANG; VALIDATION; CARE
AB Health literacy is increasingly recognized as an important determinant of health outcomes, but definition, measurement tools, and interventions are lacking. Conceptual frameworks must include both individual and health-systems domains which, in combination, determine an individual's health literacy. Validated tools lack applicability in marginalized populations with very low educational levels, such as migrant worker communities on the Myanmar-Thailand border. We undertake a comprehensive health literacy assessment following a case study of a recent public health campaign promoting preconceptual folic acid uptake in this community. A mixed-methods design utilized quantitative analysis of the prevalence and predictors of low Health literacy, and focus group discussions to gather qualitative data from women about proposed and actual posters used in the campaign. Health literacy was measured with a locally developed tool that has been used in surveys of the population since 1995. Health literacy was low, with 194/525 (37.0%) of tested women demonstrating adequate health literacy, despite 63.1% (331/525) self-reporting being literate. Only one third of women had completed 4th grade or above and reported grade level attained in school was more predictive of health literacy than self-reported literacy. Focus group discussions revealed that low literacy, preconceived associations, and traditional health beliefs (individual domain) interacted with complex images, subtle concepts, and taboo images on posters (health-systems domain) to cause widespread misunderstandings of the visuals used in the campaign. The final poster still required explanation for clarity. Low health literacy is prevalent among pregnant women from this migrant community and barriers to communication are significant and complex. Public health posters need piloting prior to implementation as unanticipated misperceptions are common and difficult to overcome. Verbal communication remains a key method of messaging with individuals of low health literacy and educational system strengthening and audiovisual messaging are critical for improvement of health outcomes.

   analysis
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; WOMEN; RISK; PREVALENCE; BIRTH; ABUSE
AB Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a public health problem that affects millions of women worldwide and can occur during both pregnancy and the perinatal period. We aimed to evaluate if the experience of psychological and physical intimate partner violence (IPV) adversely affects pregnancy outcomes. We established a cohort of 779 consecutive mothers receiving antenatal care including ultrasound and giving birth in 15 public hospitals, drawn using cluster sampling of all obstetric services in Andalusia, Spain (February-June 2010). Trained midwives gathered IPV data using the Index of Spouse Abuse validated in the Spanish language (score ranges: 0-100, higher scores reflect more severe IPV; cutoffs: physical IPV = 10, psychological IPV = 25). Socio-demographic data, including lack of kin support, maternal outcomes, and hospitalization were collected. Multivariate logistic regression estimated adjusted odds ratios (AOR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI), of the relationship between psychological and physical IPV and maternal outcomes, controlling for socio-demographic characteristics. Response rate was 92.2%. Psychological IPV, reported by 21.0% (n = 151), was associated significantly with urinary tract infection (127 (23%) vs 56 (37%); AOR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.2-3.0), vaginal infection (30 (5%) vs 20 (13%); AOR = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.2-4.7) and spontaneous preterm labour (32 (6%) vs 19 (13%); AOR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.1-4.5). Physical IPV, reported by 3.6% (n = 26), was associated with antenatal hospitalizations (134 (19%) vs 11 (42%); AOR = 2.6; 95% CI = 1.0-7.1). Lack of kin support was associated with spontaneous preterm labour (AOR = 4.7; 95% CI = 1.7-12.8). Mothers with IPV have higher odds of complications. Obstetricians, gynaecologists and midwives should act as active screeners, particularly of the undervalued psychological IPV, to reduce or remedy its effects.

TI Temporal changes in the effects of ambient temperatures on hospital
   admissions in Spain
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article

   CONSULTATIONS; MORTALITY; COLD; IMPACT; MORBIDITY; WEATHER; DISEASE
AB Background
   The exposure to extreme ambient temperatures has been reported to increase mortality, although less is known about its impact on morbidity. The analysis of temporal changes in temperature-health associations has also focused on mortality with no studies on hospitalizations worldwide. Studies on temporal variations can provide insights on changes in susceptibility or on effectiveness of public health interventions. We aimed to analyse the effects of temperature on cause-specific hospital admissions in Spain and assess temporal changes using two periods, the second one characterized by the introduction of a heat health prevention plan.
   Methods
   Daily counts of non-scheduled hospital admissions for cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and respiratory diseases and daily maximum temperature were obtained for each Spanish province for the period 1997-2013. The relationship between temperature and hospitalizations was estimated using distributed lag non-linear models. We compared the risk of hospitalization due to temperatures (cold, heat and extreme heat) in two periods (1997-2002 and 2004-2013).
   Results
   Cold temperatures were associated with increased risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and respiratory hospital admissions. Hot temperatures were only associated with higher hospital admissions for respiratory causes while hospitalizations for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases did not increase with heat. There was a small reduction in heat-related respiratory admissions in period 2. Whereas cold-related hospitalizations for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases increased in period 2, a significant reduction for respiratory hospitalizations was reported.
   Conclusions
   Our results suggested that heat had an adverse impact on hospital admissions for respiratory diseases, while cold increased the risk of the three studied cause-specific hospitalizations. Public health interventions should also focus on morbidity effects of temperature.

TI How many sexual minorities are hidden? Projecting the size of the global
   closet with implications for policy and public health
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ORIENTATION IDENTITY; STRUCTURAL STIGMA; GAY; MEN; CONCEALMENT
AB Because sexual orientation concealment can exact deep mental and physical health costs and dampen the public visibility necessary for advancing equal rights, estimating the proportion of the global sexual minority population that conceals its sexual orientation represents a matter of public health and policy concern. Yet a historic lack of cross-national datasets of sexual minorities has precluded accurate estimates of the size of the global closet. We extrapolated the size of the global closet (i.e., the proportion of the global sexual minority population who conceals its sexual orientation) using a large sample of sexual minorities collected across 28 countries and an objective index of structural stigma (i.e., discriminatory national laws and policies affecting sexual minorities) across 197 countries. We estimate that the majority (83.0%) of sexual minorities around the world conceal their sexual orientation from all or most people and that country-level structural stigma can serve as a useful predictor of the size of each country's closeted sexual minority population. Our analysis also predicts that eliminating structural stigma would drastically reduce the size of the global closet. Given its costs to individual health and social equality, the closet represents a considerable burden on the global sexual minority population. The present projection suggests that the surest route to improving the wellbeing of sexual minorities worldwide is through reducing structural forms of inequality. Yet, another route to alleviating the personal and societal toll of the closet is to develop public health interventions that sensitively reach the closeted sexual minority population in high-stigma contexts worldwide. An important goal of this projection, which relies on data from Europe, is to spur future research from non-Western countries capable of refining the estimate of the association between structural stigma and sexual orientation concealment using local experiences of both.

   EXERCISE; DISEASE; COSTS; RISK
AB The time spent in sedentary behaviour represents an important public health burden. To reduce sedentary time in the general population, the simplest, most effective, and most accessible method is to decrease lying and sitting time. We aimed to compare differences on energy expenditure (EE) across lying, sitting, and standing positions; and to analyse the associations between the change on EE of changing from one position to another and anthropometric and body composition parameters in young healthy adults. A total of 55 (69% women) young healthy adults aged 21.7 +/- 2.2 participated in the study. We measured EE by indirect calorimetry across lying, sitting, and standing positions following the standard procedures. The EE was significantly higher in standing than in both lying and sitting positions (mean difference: 0.121 +/- 0.292 and 0.125 +/- 0.241 kcal/min, respectively; all P<0.001), and no differences were observed between lying and sitting positions (P = 1.000). There was a negative association between the EE differences in sitting vs. standing position and lean body mass (P = 0.048), yet no associations between EE differences with the rest of the anthropometric and body composition parameters were observed in each position pair studied (all P>0.321). Our findings support the fact that increasing the time spent standing could be a simple strategy to slightly increase EE. Therefore, our results have important clinical implications including a better monitoring, characterizing, and promoting countermeasures to sedentariness through low-level physical activities.

TI The child survival impact of the Ghana Essential Health Interventions
   Program: A health systems strengthening plausibility trial in Northern
   Ghana

AB Background
   The Ghana Health Service in collaboration with partner institutions implemented a five-year primary health systems strengthening program known as the Ghana Essential Health Intervention Program (GEHIP). GEHIP was a plausibility trial implemented in an impoverished region of northern Ghana around the World Health Organizations (WHO) six pillars combined with community engagement, leadership development and grassroots political support, the program organized a program of training and action focused on strategies for saving newborn lives and community-engaged emergency referral services. This paper analyzes the effect of the GEHIP program on child survival.
   Methods
   Birth history data assembled from baseline and endline surveys are used to assess the hazard of child mortality in GEHIP treatment and comparison areas prior to and after the start of treatment. Difference-in-differences (DiD) methods are used to compare mortality change over time among children exposed to GEHIP relative to children in the comparison area over the same time period. Models test the hypothesis that a package of systems strengthening activities improved childhood survival. Models adjusted for the potentially confounding effects of baseline differentials, secular mortality trends, household characteristics such as relative wealth and parental educational attainment, and geographic accessibility of clinical care.
   Results
   The GEHIP combination of health systems strengthening activities reduced neonatal mortality by approximately one half (HR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.28,0.98, p = 0.045). There was a null incremental effect of GEHIP on mortality of post-neonate infants (from 1 to 12 months old) (HR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.30,1.79; p = 0.480) and post-infants (from 1 year to 5 years old) -(HR = 1.02; 95% CI = 0.55-1.90; p = 0.940). Age-specific analyses show that impact was concentrated among neonates. However, effect ratios for post-infancy were inefficiently assessed owing to extensive survival history censoring for the later months of childhood. Children were observed only rarely for periods over 40 months of age.
   Conclusion
   GEHIP results show that a comprehensive approach to newborn care is feasible, if care is augmented by community-based nurses. It supports the assertion that if appropriate mechanisms are put in place to enable the various pillars of the health system as espoused by WHO in rural impoverished settings where childhood mortality is high, it could lead to accelerated reductions in mortality thereby increasing survival of children. Policy implications of the pronounced neonatal effect of GEHIP merit national review for possible scale-up.

AB Demographic and income disparities may impact food accessibility. Research has not yet well documented the precise location of healthy and unhealthy food resources around children's homes and schools. The objective of this study was to examine the food environment around homes and schools for all public school children, stratified by race/ethnicity and poverty status. This cross-sectional study linked data on the exact home and school addresses of a population-based sample of public school children in New York City from 2013 to all corner stores, supermarkets, fast-food restaurants, and wait-service restaurants. Two measures were created around these addresses for all children: 1) distance to the nearest outlet, and 2) count of outlets within 0.25 miles. The total analytic sample included 789,520 K-12 graders. The average age was 11.78 years (SD +/- 4.0 years). Black, Hispanic, and Asian students live and attend schools closer to nearly all food outlet types than White students, regardless of poverty status. Among not low-income students, Black, Hispanic, and Asian students were closer from home and school to corner stores and supermarkets, and had more supermarkets around school than White students. The context in which children live matters, and more nuanced data is important for development of appropriate solutions for childhood obesity. Future research should examine disparities in the food environment in other geographies and by other demographic characteristics, and then link these differences to health outcomes like body mass index. These findings can be used to better understand disparities in food access and to help design policies intended to promote healthy eating among children.

TI First-line tuberculosis drug resistance patterns and associated risk
   factors in Germany, 2008-2017
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; RIFAMPICIN RESISTANCE; BORN PERSONS; EUROPE
AB Background
   Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), especially multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), poses a threat to public health. While standard surveillance focuses on Rifampicin and/or Isoniazid resistance, little is known about other resistance patterns. This study aims to identify predominant drug resistance (DR) patterns in Germany and risk factors associated with them in order to inform diagnostic and treatment strategies.
   Methods
   Case-based TB surveillance data notified in Germany from 2008-2017 were utilized to investigate DR and MDR-TB patterns for Isoniazid (H), Rifampicin (R), Pyrazinamide (Z), Ethambutol (E), and Streptomycin (S). Predominant patterns were further analyzed stratified by sex, age, country of birth, prior TB, and disease site. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to determine risk factors associated with any resistance, MDR-TB, and complete HRZES resistance.
   Results
   26,228 cases with complete DST results were included in the study, among which 3,324 cases had any DR (12.7%). Four patterns were predominant, representing about 3/4 of all cases with any resistance (S: 814 [3.1%]; H: 768 [2.9%]; HS: 552 [2.1%]; Z: 412 [1.6%]). High proportions of S and H resistances were found among both German and foreign-born populations, especially those born in Eastern Europe, and were unexpectedly high among children (H: 4.3%; S: 4.6%). Foreign-born cases had significantly higher proportion of any resistance (16.0%) and MDR-TB (3.3%) compared to German-born cases (8.3% and 0.6%). Of 556 MDR-TB cases, 39.2% showed complete HRZES resistance. Logistic regression revealed having prior TB and being foreign-born as consistently strong risk factors for any DR, MDR-TB, and complete HRZES resistance.
   Conclusions
   DR patterns observed in Germany, particularly for MDR-TB were more complex than expected, highlighting the fact that detailed drug-testing results are crucial before incorporating HRZES drugs in MDR-TB treatment. Furthermore, the relatively high rate of H-resistance in Germany provides strong rationale against the use of only H-based preventive therapy for LTBI.

AB Background
   Although lung cancer is most commonly diagnosed in elderly patients, evidence about tumor-directed therapy in elderly patients is sparse, and it is unclear to what extent this affects treatment and care. Our study aimed to discover potential disparities in care between elderly patients and those under 65 years of age.
   Methods
   We studied claims from 13 283 German patients diagnosed with lung cancer in 2009 who survived for at least 90 days after diagnosis. We classified patients as "non-elderly" (<= 65), "young-old" (65-74), "middle-old" (75-84), and "old-old" (>= 85). We compared receipt of tumor-directed therapy (6 months after diagnosis), palliative care, opioids, antidepressants, and pathologic diagnosis confirmation via logistic regression. We used generalized linear regression (gamma distribution) to compare group-specific costs of care for 3 months after diagnosis. We adjusted all models by age, nursing home residency, nursing care need, comorbidity burden, and area of residence (urban, rural). The age group "non-elderly" served as reference group.
   Results
   Compared with the reference group "non-elderly", the likelihood of receiving any tumor-directed treatment was significantly lower in all age groups with a decreasing gradient with advancing age. Elderly lung cancer patients received significantly fewer resections and radiotherapy than non-elderly patients. In particular, treatment with antineoplastic therapy declined with increasing age ("young-old" (OR = 0.76, CI = [0.70,0.83]), "middle-old" (OR = 0.45, CI = [0.36,0.50]), and "old-old" (OR = 0.13, CI = [0.10,0.17])). Patients in all age groups were less likely to receive structured palliative care than "non-elderly" ("young-old" (OR = 0.84, CI = [0.76,0.92]), "middle-old" (OR = 0.71, CI = [0.63,0.79]), and "old-old" (OR = 0.57, CI = [0.44,0.73])). Moreover, increased age was significantly associated with reduced quotas for outpatient treatment with opioids and antidepressants. Costs of care decreased significantly with increasing age.
   Conclusion
   This study suggests the existence of age-dependent care disparities in lung cancer patients, where elderly patients are at risk of potential undertreatment. To support equal access to care, adjustments to public health policies seem to be urgently required.

TI The association between quality measures of medical university press
   releases and their corresponding news stories-Important information
   missing
SO PLOS ONE

ID MISINFORMATION
AB Background
   The news media is a key source for health and medical information, and relies to a large degree on material from press releases (PR). Medical universities are key players in the dissemination of PRs. This study aims to 1) explore the relation between the quality of press releases (PRs) from medical universities and their corresponding news stories (NSs) and 2) to identify the likelihood that specific scientific and interest-raising measures appear or are omitted in PRs and NSs.
   Methods and findings
   In this retrospective study using quantitative content analysis, PRs (n = 507) from 21 medical universities in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, the USA and the UK were retrieved. Of all PRs, 33% had media coverage, resulting in 496 NSs. With two codebooks, 18 scientific (e.g. reporting the study design of the study correctly) and 7 interest-raising measures (e.g. words like 'ground-breaking') were evaluated in the PRs and NSs. For all measures the percentage of presence in NSs and PRs was calculated, together with a Mean PR Influence Factor. Quality of PRs and NSs was defined as a score, based on 12 of the 18 scientific measures. Mean (SD) NS quality score was 6.5 (1.7) which was significantly lower than the PR score of 8.0 (1.5). The two quality scores were significantly correlated. Quality measures that were frequently omitted included reporting important study limitations (present in 21% of PRs, 21% of NSs), funding (59% of PRs, 7% of NSs) and conflicts of interest (16% of PRs, 3% of NSs). We did not evaluate the quality of the scientific papers (SPs), and can therefore not determine if the quality of PRs and NSs is associated with the quality of SPs.
   Conclusions
   This large study of medical university press releases and corresponding news stories showed that important measures of a scientific study such as funding and study limitations were omitted to a very large extent. The lay public and health personnel as well as policy makers, politicians and other decision makers may be misled by incomplete and partly inaccurate representations of scientific studies which could negatively affect important health-related behaviours and decisions.

AB BackgroundMultimorbidity is an emerging public health priority. Physical activity (PA) is recommended as one of the main lifestyle behaviours, yet the benefits of PA for people with multimorbidity are unclear. We assessed the benefits of PA on mortality and life expectancy in people with and without multimorbidity.MethodsUsing the UK Biobank dataset, we extracted data on 36 chronic conditions and defined multimorbidity as (a) 2 or more conditions, (b) 2 or more conditions combined with self-reported overall health, and (c) 2 or more top-10 most common comorbidities. Leisure-time PA (LTPA) and total PA (TPA) were measured by questionnaire and categorised as low (<600 metabolic equivalent (MET)-min/week), moderate (600 to <3000 MET-min/week), and high (3000 MET-min/week), while objectively assessed PA was assessed by wrist-worn accelerometer and categorised as low (4min/day), moderate (10min/day), and high (22min/day) walking at brisk pace. Survival models were applied to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and predict life expectancy differences.Results491,939 individuals (96,622 with 2 or more conditions) had a median follow-up of 7.0 (IQR 6.3-7.6) years. Compared to low LTPA, for participants with multimorbidity, HR for mortality was 0.75 (95% CI 0.70-0.80) and 0.65 (0.56-0.75) in moderate and high LTPA groups, respectively. This finding was consistent when using TPA measures. Using objective PA, HRs were 0.49 (0.29-0.80) and 0.29 (0.13-0.61) in the moderate and high PA groups, respectively. These findings were similar for participants without multimorbidity. In participants with multimorbidity, at the age of 45years, moderate and high LTPA were associated with an average of 3.12 (95% CI 2.53, 3.71) and 3.55 (2.34, 4.77) additional life years, respectively, compared to low LTPA; in participants without multimorbidity, corresponding figures were 1.95 (1.59, 2.31) and 1.85 (1.19, 2.50). Similar results were found with TPA. For objective PA, moderate and high levels were associated with 3.60 (-0.60, 7.79) and 5.32 (-0.47, 11.11) life years gained compared to low PA for those with multimorbidity and 3.88 (1.79, 6.00) and 4.51 (2.15, 6.88) life years gained in those without. Results were consistent when using other definitions of multimorbidity.ConclusionsThere was an inverse dose-response association between PA and mortality. A moderate exercise is associated with a longer life expectancy, also in individuals with multimorbidity.

AB BackgroundDespite the growing recognition of childhood psychological maltreatment as a public health and human rights concern, it remains rampant in developing countries including Tanzania and has a negative impact on the victim's self-esteem during adolescence. There is a lack of published studies in Tanzania that examine the relationship between childhood psychological maltreatment and self-esteem during adolescence. This study describes the relationship between childhood psychological maltreatment and self-esteem and psychological distress among adolescents in Tanzania.MethodsThis was a cross-sectional, community-based study of secondary school students that was conducted in randomly selected secondary schools in five regions in Tanzania between April 2016 and February 2017. A multistage cluster sampling technique was employed to obtain the required number of study participants. The Rosenberg self-esteem scale, Kessler psychological distress scale (K10) and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) questionnaires were used to measure the variables in the study. Pearson correlation analysis was used to analyse the correlation between variables (Psychological maltreatment and self-esteem and psychological distress).ResultsA sample of 1000 secondary school students was recruited for this study, of which 553 (55.3%) were males and 447 (44.7%) were females. The mean age at presentation was 16.456.42years. Out of the 1000 participants, 766 (76.6%) experienced psychological maltreatment. Emotional abuse was reported in 24.7% of the participants, while emotional neglect was reported in 51.9% of cases. There was a strong positive correlation between psychological maltreatment and self-esteem (r=0.55, p<0.001), whereas the correlation between psychological maltreatment and psychological distress was significantly but weak (r=-0.086, p=0.007). The results also show a strong positive correlation between psychological distress and self-esteem (r=0.16, p<0.001).Conclusion Finding from this study demonstrated that childhood psychological maltreatment is prevalent in our setting and is associated with psychological distress and low self-esteem during adolescence. Urgent intervention targeting at reducing occurrence of childhood psychological maltreatment is necessary to reduce the incidence of low self-esteem and psychological distress among Tanzanian adolescents.

AB BackgroundIn response to the increasing cancer prevalence and the evolving health service landscape across the public and private health sectors in Australia, this study aimed to map cancer services and identify factors associated with service provision and important service gaps.MethodsA prospective, cross-sectional survey was conducted throughout 2016. Extensive search strategies identified Government or privately-owned, hospital or community-based healthcare organisations with dedicated cancer services. One nominated staff member from each organisation answered a purpose specific online/paper questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, standardised rates, and single level and multilevel multinomial logistic regression were used to analyse the data. Analysis was augmented with a qualitative descriptive analysis of open-ended questions.ResultsFrom the 295 eligible organisations with a cancer service in Australia, 93.2% participated in the survey. After adjusting for remoteness, for-profit companies were significantly more likely than Government operated services to provide only one or two types of cancer services (e.g. radiotherapy) in a limited range of settings (e.g. day hospital with no in-patient or home care) (p<0.001) and less likely to provide comprehensive cancer services (p<0.001). After adjusting for ownership and the respondent's role in the organisation, respondents located in remote regions of Australia were more likely to identify cancer services that are dependent upon specialist medical practitioners as the most important service gaps in their region (p=0.003). Despite 76.0% of organisations across Australia offering some type of supportive care or survivorship services, providers identified this group of services as the most pressing service gaps in major cities, rural and remote regions alike (standardised rate: 47.9% (95%CI: 43.6-57.4%); p<.000). This included the need for improved integration, outreach and affordability.ConclusionsThe broad range of cancer services, settings and ownership identified by this survey highlights the complexity of the Australian healthcare system that cancer survivors must navigate and the challenges of providing comprehensive cancer care particularly in rural and remote regions. Whilst the significant role of supportive care and survivorship services are increasingly being recognised, the findings from this survey support calls for innovative service models and funding mechanisms that expand the focus from preventing and treating cancer to supporting cancer survivors throughout the cancer continuum and promoting the delivery of integrated and equitable cancer care across the public and private sectors.

ID HEALTH; ENGLAND
AB BackgroundPrimary care is a central element of healthcare and addresses the main health problems of the population. While primary care gains in importance due to an aging population, there is an ongoing debate on physician shortages in German rural regions. The study aims on analyzing the population's preferences on primary healthcare and, therefore, on helping policy makers to make care delivery more responsive to patients' needs when planning political reforms of primary care.MethodsA paper-based discrete choice experiment (DCE) was used to assess preferences of the population of eight rural regions in Germany. Based on literature search and qualitative research, six attributes were selected and included in the choice experiment. The survey presented participants with eight choice sets in which they had to choose between two possible scenarios of care. A conditional logistic regression as well as a latent class model (LCM) were used to analyze preferences for primary healthcare.ResultsNine hundred four participants completed the survey (response rate 46.1%). The conditional logistic regression showed significant impact of the attributes home visits, distance to practice, number of healthcare providers, opening hours of the practice, and diagnostic facilities on the respondents' choices of primary healthcare alternatives. Moreover, the LCM identified four classes that can be characterized by preference homogeneity within and heterogeneity between the classes.ConclusionAlthough the study revealed heterogeneous preferences among the latent classes, several similarities in preferences for primary care could be detected. The knowledge on these public preferences may help policy makers when implementing new models of primary care and, thus, raise the populations' acceptance of future primary care provision and innovative care models.

AB BackgroundWaiting times for elective treatments, including elective surgery, are a source of public concern and therefore are on policy makers' agenda. The long waiting times have often been tackled through the allocation of additional resources, in an attempt to reduce them, but results are not straightforward. At the same time, researchers have reported wide geographical variations in the provision of elective care not driven by patient needs or preferences but by other factors.The paper analyses the relationship between waiting times and treatment rates for nine high-volume elective surgical procedures in order to support decision making regarding the availability of these services for the citizens. Using the framework already proposed for the diagnostic services, we identify different patterns that can be followed to align the supply with patient needs in the Italian context.MethodsAfter measuring the waiting times and the treatment rates for nine procedures in the 34 districts in Tuscany, we performed correlation analyses. Then, we plotted the results in a matrix cross-checking waiting times and rates. By doing so, we identified four different contexts that require a second step analysis to tackle unwarranted geographical variations and ensure timely care to patients. Finally, for each district and elective surgical procedure, we measured the economic impact of the different treatment rates in order to evaluate whether there are any supply criticalities and eventually some room for maneuver. We also included active and passive mobility of patients.ResultsThe results show a high degree of variation both in treatment rates and waiting times, especially for the orthopaedic procedures: knee replacement, knee arthroscopy and hip replacement. The analysis performed for the nine interventions shows that the 34 districts are in varying positions in the waiting time-treatment rate matrix, suggesting that there is no straightforward relationship between rates and waiting times. Each combination in the matrix may have different determinants that require healthcare managers to adopt diversified strategies. The decision making process needs to be supported by a two-level analysis: the first one to put in place the matrix that cross-checks waiting times and treatment rates, the second one to analyse the characteristics of each quadrant and the improvement actions that can be proposed.ConclusionsIn Italy, waiting times in elective surgical services are a main policy issue with a relevant geographical variation. Our analysis reveals that this variation is due to multiple elements. In order to avoid simplistic approaches that do not solve the problem but often lead to increased expenditure, policy makers and healthcare managers should follow a two-step strategy firstly identifying the type of context and secondly analysing the impact of elements such as resource productivity, resource availability, patients' preferences and care appropriateness. Only in some cases it is required to increase the service supply.

AB BackgroundA cholera outbreak started on 29 February in Bwikhonge Sub-county, Bulambuli District in Eastern Uganda. Local public health authorities implemented initial control measures. However, in late March, cases sharply increased in Bwikhonge Sub-county. We investigated the outbreak to determine its scope and mode of transmission, and to inform control measures.MethodsWe defined a suspected case as sudden onset of watery diarrhea from 1 March 2016 onwards in a resident of Bulambuli District. A confirmed case was a suspected case with positive stool culture for V. cholerae. We conducted descriptive epidemiologic analysis of the cases to inform the hypothesis on mode of transmission. To test the hypothesis, we conducted a case-control study involving 100 suspected case-patients and 100 asymptomatic controls, individually-matched by residence village and age. We collected seven water samples for laboratory testing.ResultsWe identified 108 suspected cases (attack rate: 1.3%, 108/8404), including 7 confirmed cases. The case-control study revealed that 78% (78/100) of case-patients compared with 51% (51/100) of control-persons usually collected drinking water from the nearby Cheptui River (ORMH=7.8, 95% CI=2.7-22); conversely, 35% (35/100) of case-patients compared with 54% (54/100) of control-persons usually collected drinking water from borehole pumps (ORMH=0.31, 95% CI=0.13-0.65). The index case in Bwikhonge Sub-county had onset on 29 February but the outbreak had been on-going in the neighbouring sub-counties in the previous 3 months. V. cholera was isolated in 2 of the 7 river water samples collected from different locations.ConclusionsWe concluded that this cholera outbreak was caused by drinking contaminated water from Cheptui River. We recommended boiling and/or treating drinking water, improved sanitation, distribution of chlorine tablets to the affected villages, and as a long-term solution, construction of more borehole pumps. After implementing preventive measures, the number of cases declined and completely stopped after 6th April.

AB BackgroundWhile frameworks exist for strengthening health care systems and public health systems, there are no practical frameworks to describe, assess and strengthen systems for chronic disease prevention (CDP) using complex systems approaches.MethodsA systematic and integrative review of peer reviewed literature was conducted to answer the following questions: How can systems for CDP be defined? What are key attributes of effective systems? How are complex systems approaches discussed? Search terms were identified and the Medline, SCOPUS, and Global Health databases were searched December 2017 and January 2018. Reference lists and selected journals were hand searched. A working definition for a system for CDP was developed to provide a guideline for inclusion. Key exclusion criteria were literature did not address the research questions or working definition; was published in a language other than English and before 2000; focused on specific chronic diseases and/or risk factors and not CDP broadly; concentrated on the health care sector and clinical services and/or health status and surveillance data; and described evaluations of setting specific actions such as policies, programs, interventions, approaches, projects, laws, or regulations. Selected literature (n=141) was coded in terms of the extent to which the research questions and the working definition of systems for CDP were addressed. Data was then analysed and synthesized to determine key themes.ResultsA revised definition of systems for CDP and seven attributes of effective systems for CDP are reported (collaborative capacity, health equity paradigm, leadership and governance, resources, implementation of desired actions, information and complex systems paradigm). A framework was developed to provide a foundation for describing, assessing and strengthening systems for CDP.ConclusionsThe results of this literature review provide a strong foundation for a framework to help strengthen systems for CDP. The framework consolidates not only well-established attributes of effective CDP but also highlights theoretical and practical insights from complex systems perspectives.

AB BackgroundThis study examined factors influencing cultural beliefs associated with later-stage detection of breast cancer and determined what factors influence those cultural beliefs in Vietnamese women residing in a rural Vietnamese community.MethodsA cross-sectional survey was conducted with 289 women aged 20-64years from 12 villages using a self-administered structured questionnaire. Cultural beliefs were measured with a 13-item cultural beliefs scale consisting of four domainscharacteristics of breast lumps, self-help techniques, faith-based beliefs, and futility of treatment. Data were collected in February 2017 and analyzed using chi-square tests, nonparametric tests, Fisher's exact tests, and multiple linear regression analyses with SPSS/WIN 24.0 statistical software.ResultsAlthough the total score was relatively low (3.4 out of 13), cultural beliefs that could contribute to later-stage breast cancer were identified. Younger women (=.15, p=.016) and women with a lower income (=.21, p<.001) held more erroneous cultural beliefs as compared to their counterparts. Most women believed they would not get breast cancer if they took care of themselves. More than one-third held cultural beliefs about breast lumps, thinking they would need to be painful and/or actively growing to be breast cancer.ConclusionsThe results support the urgent need for education concerning breast cancer health promotion, including breast cancer assessment as well as guidance on evidence-based and up-to-date detection measures to change rural Vietnamese women's cultural beliefs.

AB The emergence of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has raised serious concerns due to the virus' rapid dissemination into new geographic areas and the clinical features associated with infection. To better understand CHIKV dynamics in Rio de Janeiro, we generated 11 near-complete genomes by means of real-time portable nanopore sequencing of virus isolates obtained directly from clinical samples. To better understand CHIKV dynamics in Rio de Janeiro, we generated 11 near-complete genomes by means of real-time portable nanopore sequencing of virus isolates obtained directly from clinical samples. Our phylogenetic reconstructions indicated the circulation of the East-Central-South-African (ECSA) lineage in Rio de Janeiro. Time-measured phylogenetic analysis combined with CHIKV notified case numbers revealed the ECSA lineage was introduced in Rio de Janeiro around June 2015 (95% Bayesian credible interval: May to July 2015) indicating the virus was circulating unnoticed for 5 months before the first reports of CHIKV autochthonous transmissions in Rio de Janeiro, in November 2015. These findings reinforce that continued genomic surveillance strategies are needed to assist in the monitoring and understanding of arbovirus epidemics, which might help to attenuate public health impact of infectious diseases.

AB BackgroundAvian influenza virus can directly cross species barriers and infect humans with high fatality. As antigen novelty for human host, the public health is being challenged seriously. The pandemic risk of avian influenza viruses should be analyzed and a prediction model should be constructed for virology applications.ResultsThe 178 signature positions in 11 viral proteins were firstly screened as features by the scores of five amino acid factors and their random forest rankings. The Supporting Vector Machine algorithm achieved well performance. The most important amino acid factor (Factor 5) and the minimal range of signature positions (63 amino acid residues) were also explored. Moreover, human-origin avian influenza viruses with three or four genome segments from human virus had pandemic risk with high probability.ConclusionUsing machine learning methods, the present paper scores the amino acid mutations and predicts pandemic risk with well performance. Although long evolution distances between avian and human viruses suggest that avian influenza virus in nature still need time to fix among human host, it should be notable that there are high pandemic risks for H7N9 and H9N2 avian viruses.

However, the utilisation of this service, together with its associations on hypertension treatment and BP control has not been fully investigated.MethodsThe study population was from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) in 2015. Cross-sectional data of 2487 hypertensive persons were included as subjects. Stratified sample households were selected from 450 villages or communities of 150 counties from 28 provinces. Finally, 21,097 individuals were interviewed successfully. The main outcome was hypertension control (having average BP under 140-90mmHg). The main independent variable was utilisation of community-based BP monitoring service (having BP examination once a season or more). The mediators were hypertension treatment (currently taking any antihypertensive medicine) and lifestyle factors (alcohol intake, physical activity, smoke). We performed chi-square and binary logistic regression to analyse associations of BP monitoring with hypertension treatment and blood pressure control. The mediation model was examined by the Sobel test.ResultsMean age of the population was 64.2 (0.24). The percentage of males was 42.8%. Prevalence of community-based BP monitoring was 32.1%. Patients who used this service had higher odds of hypertension treatment (=1.259, P<0.01, OR=3.52, CI=2.467-5.030), and BP control (=0.220, P<0.05, OR=1.246, CI=1.035-1.499). Medication treatment played a complete mediating role between monitoring and hypertension control in this study (t=4.51, P<0.001). Those who underwent BP monitoring tended to be those who did not finish primary school education (2=30.300, P<0.001), had poorer household income (2=18.298, P<0.05), and lived in rural areas rather than in urban areas (2=40.369, P<0.001).ConclusionsAlthough the use of BP monitoring service had no direct effect on BP control, it had a positive effect on BP control through the full mediation effect of hypertension treatment. Termly BP monitoring by community-based health expertise among hypertensive persons, for instance, once a season, can be recommended to public health policymakers for BP control through instructions on medication treatment and health behaviours.

AB BackgroundIn China multidrug-resistant bacteria pose a considerable threat to public health. Antimicrobial resistance has weakened the effectiveness of many medicines widely used today. Thus, discovering new antibacterial drugs is paramount in the effort to treat emerging drug-resistant bacteria.MethodsEravacycline, tigecycline and other clinical routine antibiotics were tested by reference broth micro-dilution method against 336 different strains collected from 11 teaching hospitals in China between 2012 and 2016. These isolates included Enterobacteriaceae, non-fermentative, Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus, and a number of fastidious organisms. The strains involved in this study possess the most important drug resistance characteristics currently known in China. Drug resistant bacteria such as those producing extended spectrum -lactamases (ESBL) and carbapenemases (KPC-2 and NDM-1), and those exhibiting colistin resistance (mcr-1) and tigecycline were included in this study. Additionally, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), -lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae, and penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) were also included.ResultsEravacycline exhibited good efficacy against all the strains tested, especially for organisms with ESBLs, carbapenemases, and mcr-1 gene compared with tigecycline and other antibiotics tested. The MIC values of eravacycline against carbapenemase producing Enterobacteriaceae and OXA-23-producing A. baumannii were much lower than the MIC values of other antibiotics. MRSA, VRE, -lactamase positive Haemophilus influenza, and PRSP were sensitive to eravacycline in every strain tested. Furthermore, in most strains tested, the MICs of eravacycline were two to four-fold lower than the MICs of tigecycline.ConclusionsEravacycline has shown potent antibacterial activity against common and clinically important antibiotic-resistant pathogens. The MIC distribution of eravacycline was generally lower than that of tigecycline which demonstrates that this new drug is potentially more effective than the existing medications.

AB BackgroundService providers throughout Europe have identified the need to define how high-quality community-based mental health care looks to organize their own services and to inform governments, commissioners and funders. In 2016, representatives of mental health care service providers, networks, umbrella organizations and knowledge institutes in Europe came together to establish the European Community Mental Health Services Provider (EUCOMS) Network. This network developed a shared vision on the principles and key elements of community mental health care in different contexts. The result is a comprehensive consensus paper, of which this position paper is an outline.With this paper the network wants to contribute to the discussion on how to improve structures in mental healthcare, and to narrow the gap between evidence, policy and practice in Europe.Main textThe development of the consensus paper started with an expert workshop in April 2016. An assigned writing group representing the workshop participants built upon the outcomes of this meeting and developed the consensus paper with the input from 100 European counterparts through two additional work groups, and two structured feedback rounds via email.High quality community-based mental health care: 1) protects human rights; 2) has a public health focus; 3) supports service users in their recovery journey; 4) makes use of effective interventions based on evidence and client goals; 5) promotes a wide network of support in the community and; 6) makes use of peer expertise in service design and delivery. Each principle is illustrated with good practices from European service providers that are members of the EUCOMS Network.ConclusionsDiscussion among EUCOMS network members resulted in a blueprint for a regional model of integrated mental health care based upon six principles.

AB BackgroundIn Ghana, limited evidence exists about the geographical accessibility to health facilities providing tuberculosis (TB) diagnostic services to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, we aimed to assess the geographic accessibility to public health facilities providing TB testing services at point-of-care (POC) in the Upper East Region (UER), Ghana.MethodsWe assembled detailed spatial data on all 10 health facilities providing TB testing services at POC, and landscape features influencing journeys. These data were used in a geospatial model to estimate actual distance and travel time from the residential areas of the population to health facilities providing TB testing services. Maps displaying the distance values were produced using ArcGIS Desktop v10.4. Spatial distribution of the health facilities was done using spatial autocorrelation (Global Moran's Index) run in ArcMap10.4.1. We also applied remote sensing through satellite imagery analysis to map out residential areas and identified locations for targeted improvement in the UER.ResultsOf the 13 districts in the UER, 4 (31%) did not have any health facility providing TB testing services. In all, 10 public health facilities providing TB testing services at POC were available in the region representing an estimated population to health facility ratio of 125,000 people per facility. Majority (60%) of the health facilities providing TB testing services in the region were in districts with a total population greater than 100,000 people. Majority (62%) of the population resident in the region were located more than 10km away from a health facility providing TB testing services. The mean distance standard deviation to the nearest public health facility providing TB testing services in UER was 33.2km +/- 13.5. Whilst the mean travel time using a motorized tricycle speed of 20km/h to the nearest facility providing TB testing services in the UER was 99.6min +/- 41.6. The results of the satellite imagery analysis show that 51 additional health facilities providing TB testing services at POC are required to improve geographical accessibility. The results of the spatial autocorrelation analysis show that the spatial distribution of the health facilities was dispersed (z-score=-2.3; p=0.02).ConclusionThere is poor geographic accessibility to public health facilities providing TB testing services at POC in the UER of Ghana. Targeted improvement of rural PHC clinics in the UER to enable them provide TB testing services at POC is highly recommended.

AB Staphylococcus aureus infections represent a major public health threat, but previous attempts at developing a universal vaccine have been unsuccessful. We attempted to identify a vaccine that would be protective against both skin/soft tissue and bloodstream infections. We first tested a panel of staphylococcal antigens that are conserved across strains, combined with aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant, for their ability to induce protective immunity in both skin and bacteremia infection models. Antigens were identified that reduced dermonecrosis during skin infection, and other non-overlapping antigens were identified that showed trends to protection in the bacteremia model. However, individual antigens were not identified that mediated substantial protection in both the skin and bacteremia infection models. We therefore tested a variety of combinations of proteins to seek a single combination that could mediate protection in both models. After iterative testing, a vaccine consisting of 3 antigens, ABC transporter protein (SACOL2451), ABC2 transporter protein (SACOL0695), and a-hemolysin (SACOL1173), was identified as the most effective combination. This combination vaccine provided protection in a skin infection model. However, these antigens were only partially protective in the bacteremia infection model. Even by testing multiple different adjuvants, optimized efficacy in the skin infection model did not translate into efficacy in the bacteremia model. Thus protective vaccines against skin/soft tissue infections may not enable effective protection against bloodstream infections.

AB Background
   Gastrointestinal parasites are neglected infections, yet they cause significant burden to animal and human health globally. To date, most studies of gastrointestinal parasites focus on host-parasite systems that involve either a single parasite or a host species. However, when hosts share habitat and resources, they may also cross-transmit generalist gastrointestinal parasites. Here we explore multi-host-parasite interactions in a single ecosystem to understand the infection patterns, especially those linked to livestock-wildlife interfaces and zoonotic risk.
   Methods
   We used both coprological methods (flotation and sedimentation; N = 1,138 fecal samples) and molecular identification techniques (rDNA and mtDNA; N = 18 larvae) to identify gastrointestinal parasites in nine sympatric host species (cattle, sheep, goats, wildebeest, Grant's gazelles, Thomson's gazelles, impala, vervet monkeys and baboons) in the Amboseli ecosystem, Kenya.
   Results
   We found that the host community harbored a diverse community of gastrointestinal helminths, including 22 species and/or morphotypes that were heterogeneously distributed across the hosts. Six zoonotic gastrointestinal helminths were identified: Trichuris spp., Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Enterobius spp. Oesophagostomum bifurcum, Strongyloides stercoralis and Strongyloides fuelleborni. The dominant parasite was Trichuris spp, whose ova occurred in two morphological types. Baboons were co-infected with Strongyloides fuelleborni and S. stercoralis.
   Conclusions
   We found that the interface zone shared by wild ungulates, livestock and non-human primates is rich in diversity of gastrointestinal helminths, of which some are extensively shared across the host species. Closely related host species were most likely to be infected by the same parasite species. Several parasites showed genetic sub-structuring according to either geography or host species. Of significance and contrary to expectation, we found that livestock had a higher parasite richness than wild bovids, which is a health risk for both conservation and livestock production. The zoonotic parasites are of public health risk, especially to pastoralist communities living in areas contiguous to wildlife areas. These results expand information on the epidemiology of these parasites and highlights potential zoonotic risk in East African savanna habitats.

AB Objective
   We analyzed the preference of three psychological intervention formats-individual, group, and online-in a sample of 267 patients with a primary diagnosis of emotional disorder in Spanish public mental health settings.
   Method
   We studied patients' preferences considering sociodemographic characteristics, diagnoses, history of psychological treatments, number of sessions, and satisfaction with past interventions.
   Results
   Most participants (85.4%) preferred psychological treatment in an individual format, 14.2% in group, and 0.4% online. When comparing the people who chose individual and group treatment, no demographic or clinical differences were found. The arguments against group format were the lack of privacy and expression difficulties. Regarding online format, these included being considered impersonal and ineffective.
   Conclusion
   The rejection of group and online psychotherapy formats allows us to define the actions we should carry out in public mental health settings to improve the acceptance of more cost-effective therapy formats.

AB Background
   Diabetes mellitus is a major public health problem which accounts for serious medical and economic consequences. Depression is an important associated condition that upsets the management and complications of diabetes. This study aimed to measure the prevalence of depression among people living with Type 2 Diabetes and to examine the factors linked with it.
   Methods
   This community based, cross-sectional study was conducted among 278 people living with type 2 diabetes in Duhabi-Bhaluwa municipality, Nepal. A face to face interview was conducted using a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire to gain information on socio-demographic characteristics and clinical profile of the participants. Depression was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) scale. Variables were categorical and were thus, compared with Pearson's chi-square tests and binary logistic regression models.
   Results
   The prevalence of depression in this study was 22.7%. Most people indicative of having depression were of older age, females, below secondary level education, with a smaller family size, with low family income, using insulin, without a family history of diabetes and/or having an additional illness. However, multivariate analysis showed that the only significant factors for depression were older age, education below secondary level, homemaker, smaller family size, using insulin and having an additional illness.
   Conclusion
   The prevalence of depression in this study is consistent with that reported by other communities. Factors like older age, lower education level, being a homemaker, living in a small size family, insulin use and additional illness could increase the likelihood of developing Major Depressive disorder among people with type 2 diabetes, hence, psychosocial assessment is necessary along with diabetes management plan in a primary health care setting.

AB BackgroundAdvance care planning (ACP) is the process of ongoing communication among patients, family and health care professionals regarding what plans for future care are preferred in the event that patients become unable to make their own decisions. Clinicians play an important role in ACP as both initiators and decision coaches. However, lack of training for clinicians has frequently been reported as the reason for low involvement in ACP discussions - hence the present review evaluates the effectiveness of ACP training programs for healthcare professionals to guide the development of novel training programs for them in the future.MethodsA literature search for intervention studies was conducted independently by two reviewers in July 2018. Participants included all healthcare professionals working with adult patients suffering from terminal illness. The primary outcomes were the professionals' knowledge of and attitudes towards ACP, and self-perceived competence in ACP conversations. The Effective Public Health Practice Project appraisal tool was used to examine the quality of the studies included.ResultsA total of 4025 articles were identified, and ten eligible articles, covering 1081 participants, were included in the review. However, there is a lack of high quality randomized controlled trials of providing ACP training for nurses working in non-palliative care hospital settings. The overall quality of the intervention studies was moderate. All the studies included used instructional sessions in their interventions, while some contained group discussion, role-play and the use of advanced technology. The training programs increased the knowledge, attitudes towards shared decision-making, perceived communication skills, confidence, comfort and experiences concerned with discussing end-of-life (EOL) issues. Patient advocacy, job satisfaction and perceived level of adequate training for EOL care were improved. The use of decision aids' was rated as acceptable and clinically useful.ConclusionsTraining for healthcare professionals in ACP has positive effects on their knowledge, attitude and skills. The use of decision aids and advanced technology, instructional sessions with role play, training content focused on ACP communication skills and the needs and experience of patient in the ACP process, and a values-based ACP process are all those factors that made the ACP training programs effective.

AB BackgroundHealth systems worldwide rely on health professionals to deliver services and provide framework structures. Considering their opinions about their work environment, the public policies that regulate their work and the deficiencies of the health care system are key aspects of the governance within the system. The aim of this study was to assess the perceptions of Ecuadorian physicians about several aspects of the performance of the health delivery and monitoring systems locally.MethodsA cross-sectional survey was performed in a group of physicians in Ecuador during 2017 using a self-selection sampling strategy. The participants were contacted by telephone, direct email or in person and asked to complete the online survey which contained 47 questions.ResultsA total of 607 full responses were received from physicians, where 68.6% of those had graduated within the last 17years. 46.4% of respondents were medical specialists, 23.1% general practitioners, 10.0% rural health practitioners, 9.5% sub-specialists, 5.9% were formally enrolled in a specialty program and 5.1% were researchers or administrative physicians. Data analysis of the answers showed that approximately 62% of physician respondents in the study found their current workload at the time of the survey was unmanageable, the most common complaints about the Public Health system in the study being the amount of daily paperwork (78.4%), followed by a perceived lack of vision of the health authorities (60.1%) and the resource limitations within the public hospitals (53.5%). Additionally, 71.8% of respondents referred to limitations of the National Essential Medicines chart- especially on the availability of some drugs- and 57.5% of the respondents reported concerns about the quality of medicines available for treatment.ConclusionsThe data provide basic inputs for health authorities regarding the functioning of the health system in Ecuador. Health professionals' concerns can be a valuable resource for monitoring and improving health system performance: however, there is a perceived sense of disconnection between the governance or management and the service delivery arms of the healthcare system in Ecuador. Whilst not representative of the entirety of the population of doctors, the study does give insight into where improvements to the health system might be made.

AB BackgroundSchistosomiasis remains a public health problem in Central Kenya despite concerted control efforts. Access to improved water and sanitation has been emphasized as important control measures. Few studies have assessed the association between access to improved water sources and sanitation facilities with Schistosoma mansoni infection in different environmental settings. This study assessed the association between S. mansoni infection and household access to improved water sources and sanitation facilities in Mwea, Kirinyaga County, Kenya.MethodsA cross sectional study was conducted between the months of August and October 2017. A total of 905 household heads from seven villages were interviewed and their stool samples screened for S. mansoni using the Kato Katz technique. Comparisons of demographic factors by S. mansoni infection were tested for significance using the chi-square test (2) or the Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Variables associated with S. mansoni infection were analyzed using univariable analysis and the strength of the association measured as odds ratio (OR) using mixed effects logistic regression at 95% CI, with values considered significant at p<0.05.ResultsThe overall prevalence of S. mansoni was, 23.1% (95% CI: 20.5-26.0%), with majority of the infections being of light intensity. Rurumi village had the highest prevalence at 33.3%, with Kirogo village having the least prevalence at 7.0%. Majority (84.1%) of the households lacked access to improved water sources but had access to improved sanitation facilities (75%). Households with access to piped water had the lowest S. mansoni infections. However, there was no significant association between S. mansoni infections with either the main source of water in the household (Odds Ratio (OR) =0.782 (95% CI: 0.497-1.229) p=0.285 or sanitation facilities (OR=1.018 (95% CI: 0.705-1.469) p=0.926.ConclusionOur study suggests that S. mansoni is still a public health problem among all age groups in Mwea irrigation scheme, Kirinyaga County, Central Kenya. Majority of the households lacks access to improved water sources but have access to improved sanitation facilities. This study recommends initiatives to ensure adequate provision of improved water sources, and the inclusion of the adult community in preventive chemotherapy programs.

AB BackgroundEvidence of chronic low levels of exposure to heavy metals in Sri Lanka has emerged in a number of studies carried out in the recent past. The source and magnitude of such exposures have to be understood in order to assess the risk of adverse health effects of this exposure and to propose suitable public health interventions.MethodsAn assessment was carried out to quantify chronic exposure to cadmium, lead and arsenic through food in people living in an area in Sri Lanka, where prevalence of Chronic Kidney Disease of unknown origin (CKDu) is highest. First a dietary survey was carried out in the subjects to estimate the type and quantity of typical food items in order to estimate an average consumption. A model diet was formulated using this dietary consumption data; and this was thereafter used for estimation of chronic dietary exposure of selected contaminants. In parallel, the levels of contaminants of interest in the various identified food items: cadmium, lead and arsenic, were determined.ResultsAssuming the major route of intake is food, and based on the quantity and type of food items consumed, a 60kg man is exposed to average doses of 83.7g cadmium, 924.1g lead, and 180.3g arsenic per week. The impact of chronic lead exposure was affirmed by a mean blood lead level of 3.0g/dL, with a maximum level of 8.8g/dL being observed in some cases.ConclusionsChronic low dose exposure of lead from food appears to be a public health concern in the studied population. Cadmium exposure through food appears to be of concern also. However, arsenic exposure through food appears to be within safe limits. As there are numbers of possible adverse health outcomes that can be associated with such estimated exposures of heavy metals, public health interventions are warranted to limit the described harmful exposures. Advocacy on dietary patterns and agronomic practices to lower the contaminants identified are the two broad strategies suggested.

TI Win/win partnerships between Geneva health-related institutions and

SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Caregivers; Partnership; Collaboration; Public heath
AB BackgroundIn the context of an ageing population and an increase in the appearance of chronic diseases, the commitment of caregivers makes it possible for people confronted with disease to remain at home. Over time, they need support to overcome their difficulties. They also show a need for recognition for their participation in the economic maintenance of the health system. To promote this support, so-called win/win partnerships are envisaged. Research is needed to identify the building blocks of an innovative intervention.MethodsA cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out with health institutions in the canton of Geneva to identify the proportion of institutions with a positive opinion on partnership with caregivers. It has also identified potential partnerships with caregivers of people facing dementia and possible compensation in exchange for the provision of their skills. Descriptive statistics are presented according to their frequencies and relative percentages (categorical variables), as well as by their mean, standard deviation and median (continuous variables). Logistic regression models were used to assess the factors associated with a favorable opinion towards win/win partnerships.ResultsThe proportion of executives of health-related institutions with a positive opinion of partnership with caregivers is high: 74.7% (95% CI: 64.8-83.1%). Several types of potential partnerships have been identified between health institutions and caregivers. Areas in which certain activities have been identified as being able to be carried out by caregivers include governance, care, provision of services, accompaniment and support, training and research. Types of compensation for caregivers have also been highlighted.ConclusionThis study shows that some areas activities of health facilities in the canton of Geneva could be the subject of win-win partnerships with caregivers of people with dementia. Positive view of health executives on partnership with caregivers is encouraging. In the future, innovative projects can emerge to meet the needs of each party.

AB BackgroundTo mitigate air pollution-related health risks and target interventions towards the populations bearing the greatest risks, the City Health Outlook (CHO) project aims to establish multi-scale, long-lasting, real-time urban environment and health monitoring networks. A major goal of CHO is to collect data of personal exposure to particulate air pollution through a full profile that consists of a matrix of activities and micro-environments. As the first paper of a series, this paper is targeted at illustrating the characteristics of the participants and examining the effects of different covariates on personal exposure at various air pollution exposure levels.MethodsIn the first campaign, volunteers are recruited to wear portable environmental sensors to record their real-time personal air pollution exposure and routes. After a web-based social media recruitment strategy, 50 eligible subjects joined the first campaign in Beijing from January 8 to January 20, 2018. The mean personal exposures were measured at 19.36, 37.65, and 43.45g/m(3) for particulate matter (PM) with a diameter less than 1, 2.5, and 10m, respectively, albeit with the high spatial-temporal variations.ResultsUnequal distribution of exposures was observed in the subjects with different sociodemographic status, travel behavior, living and health conditions. Quantile regression analysis reveals that subjects who are younger, less educated, exposed to passive smoking, low to middle household income, overweight, without ventilation system at home or office, and do not possess private vehicles, are more susceptible to PM pollution. The differences, however, are generally insignificant at low exposure levels and become evident on bad air quality days.ConclusionsThe heterogeneity in personal exposure found in this the first CHO campaign highlighted the importance of studying the pollution exposure at the individual scale. It is at the critical stage to bridge the knowledge gap of environmental inequality in different populations, which can lead to great health implications.

AB BackgroundA population-based approach to healthcare goes beyond the traditional biomedical model and addresses the importance of cross-sectoral collaboration in promoting health of communities. By establishing partnerships across primary care (PC) and public health (PH) sectors in particular, healthcare organizations can address local health needs of populations and improve health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to map a series of interventions from the empirical literature that facilitate PC-PH collaboration and develop a resource for healthcare organizations to self-evaluate their clinical practices and identify opportunities for collaboration with PH.MethodsA scoping review was designed and studies from relevant peer-reviewed literature and reports between 1990 and 2017 were included if they met the following criteria: empirical study methodology (quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods), based in US, Canada, Western Europe, Australia or New Zealand, describing an intervention involving PC-PH collaboration, and reporting on structures, processes, outcomes or markers of a PC-PH collaboration intervention.ResultsOut of 2962 reviewed articles, 45 studies with interventions leading to collaboration were classified into the following four synergy groups developed by Lasker's Committee on Medicine and Public Health: Coordinating healthcare services (n=13); Applying a population perspective to clinical practice (n=21); Identifying and addressing community health problems (n=19), and Strengthening health promotion and health protection (n=21). Furthermore, select empirical examples of interventions and their key features were highlighted to illustrate various approaches to implementing collaboration interventions in the field.ConclusionsThe findings of our review can be utilized by a range of organizations in healthcare settings across the included countries. Furthermore, we developed a self-evaluation tool that can serve as a resource for clinical practices to identify opportunities for cross-sectoral collaboration and develop a range of interventions to address unmet health needs in communities; however, the generalizability of the findings depends on the evaluations conducted in individual studies in our review.From a health equity perspective, our findings also highlight interventions from the empirical literature that address inequities in care by targeting underserved, high-risk populations groups. Further research is needed to develop outcome measures for successful collaboration and determine which interventions are sustainable in the long term.

AB BackgroundIn Singapore, a densely urbanised Asian society, more than 80% of the population stays in public housing estates and the majority (90%) own their own homes. For the needy who cannot afford home ownership, public rental flats are available. Staying in a public rental flat is associated with higher hospital readmission rates and poorer access to health services. We sought to examine sociodemographic factors associated with hospital admissions and emergency room visits amongst public rental flat residents.MethodsWe surveyed all residents aged 60years in a public rental housing precinct in central Singapore in 2016. Residents self-reported their number of emergency room visits, as well as hospitalisations, in the past 6months. We obtained information on residents' sociodemographic characteristics, medical, functional and social status via standardised questionnaires. We used chi-square to identify associations between emergency room visits/hospitalisations and sociodemographic characteristics, on univariate analysis; and logistic regression for multivariate analysis.ResultsOf 1324 contactable residents, 928 participated in the survey, with a response rate of 70.1%. A total of 928 residents participated in our study, of which 59.5% were male (553/928) and 51.2% (476/928) were70years old. Around 9% (83/928) of residents had visited the emergency room in the last 6months; while 10.5% (100/928) had been admitted to hospital in the past 6months. On multivariable analysis, being religious (aOR=0.43, 95%CI=0.24-0.76) and having seen a primary care practitioner in the last 6months (aOR=0.46, 95%CI=0.27-0.80) were independently associated with lower odds of emergency room visits, whereas loneliness (aOR=1.96, 95%CI=1.13-3.43), poorer coping (aOR=1.72, 95%CI=1.01-3.03) and better adherence (aOR=2.23, 95%CI=1.29-3.83) were independently associated with higher odds of emergency room visits. For hospitalisations, similarly poorer coping (aOR=1.85, 95%CI=1.12-3.07), better adherence (aOR=1.69, 95%CI=1.04-2.75) and poorer functional status (aOR=1.85, 95%CI=1.15-2.98) were all independently associated with higher odds of hospitalisations, whereas those who were religious (aOR=0.62, 95%CI=0.37-0.99) and those who were currently employed (aOR=0.46, 95%CI=0.37-0.99) had lower odds of being hospitalised.ConclusionIn this public rental flat population, functional status, coping and adherence, and having a religion were independently associated with emergency room visits and hospitalisation. Residents who had seen a primary care practitioner in the last 6months had lower odds of visiting the emergency room.

TI Disrespect and abuse during childbirth in Western Ethiopia: Should women
   continue to tolerate?
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID FACILITY-BASED CHILDBIRTH; MISTREATMENT; QUALITY
AB Background
   Healthcare coverage in Ethiopia has improved dramatically in recent decades. However, facility-based delivery remains persistently low, while maternal mortality remains high. This paper presents the prevalence and associated factors of disrespect and abuse (D&A) during childbirth in public health facilities of western Oromia, Ethiopia.
   Method
   A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 612 women from February 2017 to May 2017. Exit interview with the mothers were conducted upon discharge from the maternity ward. We measured D&A during childbirth using seven dimensions. Multivariable logistic regression model was used to assess the association between experience of D&A and client characteristics and institutional factors.
   Result
   Three quarters (74.8%) of women reported experiencing at least one form of D&A during their facility childbirth. The types of D&A experienced by the women were; physical abuse (37.1%), non-dignified care (34.6%), non-consented care (54.1%), non-confidential care (40.4%), neglect (25.2%), detention (2.9%), and discrimination (13.2%). Experiences of D&A were 1.6 times more likely to be reported by women delivering at hospitals than health centers (OR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.01, 2.66). Women without a companion throughout their delivery were almost 10 times more likely than women who had a companion to encounter D&A (OR: 9.94, 95% CI: 5.72, 17.28). On the other hand, women with more than 1,368-birr (USD 57) monthly income were less likely to experience any type of D&A (OR: 0.36, 95% CI:.21,.65).
   Conclusion
   Three in four women reported experiencing at least one form of D&A during labor and delivery. This demonstrates a real disconnect between what the health system intends to achieve and what is practiced and calls for fundamental solutions in terms of both improving quality of facility-based delivery and ensuring women's right to receive health care with dignity.

DT Article
ID IMPAIRMENT; GLAUCOMA
AB This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and causes of childhood blindness in a rural area of Bangladesh. We adopted a cross-sectional quantitative study design for this study, which was performed in three unions (sub-districts) located in Raiganj Upazila of the Sirajganj district in Bangladesh. Using a validated tool, a screening program was conducted at the household level. After initial screening, a team of ophthalmologists confirmed the diagnoses by clinical examinations. The prevalence of childhood blindness was observed to be 6.3 per 10,000 children, whereas the rate of uniocular blindness was 4.8 per 10,000 children. Congenital problems were the major causes of both uniocular and binocular blindness (uniocular blindness: 84% and binocular blindness: 92%). The whole globe was the site responsible for binocular blindness (28.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 13.1, 47.7), whereas the cornea was responsible for uniocular blindness (57.8%, 95% CI: 35.3, 78.1). Childhood blindness is a public health problem in Bangladesh and is highly prevalent, regardless of sex. The major causes of childhood blindness are congenital.

AB Background
   Understanding patterns of socio-economic inequalities in tobacco consumption is key to design targeted public health policies for tobacco control. This study examines socio-economic inequalities in smoking and involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke between 2005 and 2013.
   Methods
   Data were derived from the Argentine National Risk Factors Surveys, conducted in 2005, 2009, and 2013. Two inequality measures were calculated: the age-adjusted prevalence ratio (PR) and the disparity index (DI). Educational level, household income per consumer unit and employment status were used as proxies for socio-economic status (SES). Generalized linear models were used in the analysis.
   Results
   Prevalence of smoking decreased from 29.7% to 25.1% between 2005 and 2013, mainly in women (p<0.001). Despite the overall prevalence reduction, socio-economic inequalities in smoking persisted. For both men and women, the DI was moderately high for smoking (14.47%-33.06%) across the three surveys. In men, the PR indicated a higher smoking prevalence for lower educational levels and lower household income throughout the analyzed period. In women, unlike previous years, the 2013 survey showed disparity related to unemployment. Involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke in 2013 was associated with educational level and household income, with lower involuntary exposure among those with higher SES.
   Conclusions
   While overall smoking rates have decreased in Argentina, socio-economic disparities related to tobacco smoking persist. Comprehensive tobacco control programs targeted to address these inequalities are essential in developing strategies to reduce health disparities in tobacco-related diseases.

AB BackgroundStunting in developing countries continues to be a major public health problem. Measuring head circumference (HC) during clinical anthropometric assessment can help predict stunting. The aim of this study was to assess burden and determine the predictors of low HC (<-2 SD) at birth and during first 2 years of life in a semi- urban settlement of Vellore.MethodsThe study uses baseline data and serial HC measurements from the birth cohort of MAL-ED study, where 228 children from Vellore completed follow-up between March 2010 to February 2014. Analysis of baseline, maternal and paternal characteristics, micro-nutrient status and cognition with HC measurements was performed using STATA version 13.0 software.ResultsThe mean HC (SD) at 1st, 12th and 24th month were 33.37 (1.29) cm, 42.76 (1.23) cm and 44.9 (1.22) cm respectively. A third of the infants (75/228) had HC less than -2 SD at first month of life, and on follow-up, 50% of the cohort had HC-2 SD both at 12th and 24th month. Low HC measurements at all three time-points were observed for 21.6% (46/222) infants. Low HC was significantly associated with stunting in 37.3% (OR=10.8), 57.3% (OR=3.1) and 44.4% (OR=2.6) children at 1st, 12th and 24th month respectively. Bivariate analysis of low HC (<-2 SD) at 12th month showed a statistically significant association with lower socioeconomic status, low paternal and maternal HC and low maternal IQ. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed maternal (AOR=0.759, 95% CI=0.604 to 0.954) and paternal (AOR=0.734, 95% CI=0.581 to 0.930) HC to be significantly associated with HC attained by the infant at the end of 12months.Conclusions One-third of the children in our cohort had low head circumference (HC) at birth, with one-fifth recording low HC at all time-points until 2 years of age. Low HC was significantly associated with stunting. Paternal and maternal HC predicted HC in children. HC measurement, often less used, can be a simple tool that can be additionally used by clinicians as well as parents/caregivers to monitor child growth.

AB BackgroundIron has been shown to promote breast carcinogenesis in animal models through generation of oxidative stress and interaction with estrogen. Heme iron, which is found exclusively in animal-sourced foods, is suggested to have a more detrimental effect. Epidemiological evidence of the association between iron and breast cancer risk remains inconclusive and has not been comprehensively summarized. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated associations between both iron intake and body iron status and breast cancer risk.MethodsFour electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Scopus) were searched up to December 2018 for studies assessing iron intake and/or biomarkers of iron status in relation to breast cancer risk. Using random-effects meta-analyses, pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated comparing the highest vs. lowest category of each iron measure. Dose-response meta-analyses were also performed to investigate linear and nonlinear associations.ResultsA total of 27 studies were included in the review, of which 23 were eligible for meta-analysis of one or more iron intake/status measures. Comparing the highest vs. lowest category, heme iron intake was significantly associated with increased breast cancer risk, with a pooled RR of 1.12 (95% CI: 1.04-1.22), whereas no associations were found for dietary (1.01, 95% CI: 0.89-1.15), supplemental (1.02, 95% CI: 0.91-1.13), or total (0.97, 95% CI: 0.82-1.14) iron intake. Associations of iron status indicators with breast cancer risk were generally in the positive direction; however, a significant pooled RR was found only for serum/plasma levels (highest vs. lowest) of iron (1.22, 95% CI: 1.01-1.47), but not for ferritin (1.13, 95% CI: 0.78-1.62), transferrin saturation (1.16, 95% CI: 0.91-1.47), or total iron-binding capacity (1.10, 95% CI: 0.97-1.25). In addition, a nonlinear dose-response was observed for heme iron intake and serum iron (both P-nonlinearity<0.05).ConclusionsHeme iron intake and serum iron levels may be positively associated with breast cancer risk. Although associations were modest, these findings may have public health implications given the widespread consumption of (heme) iron-rich foods. In light of methodological and research gaps identified, further research is warranted to better elucidate the relationship between iron and breast cancer risk.

AB BackgroundLittle is known about the participation of surgeons in preventative health activities in the non-admitted hospital care setting. The aim of this study was to identify which preventive health activities surgeons practice and to explore their attitudes towards preventive health.MethodsA mixed methods study was conducted using a sequential explanatory design. Quantitative results were obtained from a self-reported clinician survey (n=16) and a Generalized Estimating Equation was used to assess the relationship between dependent (preventive health practice) and independent (confidence and knowledge in preventive health practice, years of practice, and attitudinal factors) variables. Using a building approach to integration, results from the quantitative analyses informed design of the interview guide. Surgeons' beliefs and attitudes were explored using in-depth, semi structured interviews with a purposeful sample of surgeons (n=14). Responses were collected, independently coded and analysed using a qualitative descriptive approach.ResultsIn accordance with a contiguous narrative approach to integration, the quantitative and qualitative findings are reported separately. The clinician survey found that the surgeons carried out preventive health activities at low levels. Preventive health advice was predominantly verbal in nature, and few surgeons provided written material or referred patients to additional services. The GEE analyses indicated that the following factors best predicted the tendency to undertake preventive health activities: years of clinical practice (p=0.041), and the perceived work priority placed on preventive health (p=0.008). Interviews generated four themes that influenced the tendency of surgeons to undertake preventive health activities: perceptions of their role in preventive health, perceived motivation of patients, hospital structure, and facilitating factors. In regards to enabling factors that are likely to increase preventive health practice, surgeons unanimously advocated for referral pathways into specialist behaviour change programs that they could facilitate within their relatively brief consulting time.ConclusionsThe findings suggests that the majority of public hospital surgeons engage in routine preventive health advice at a low level. The high volume of non-admitted surgical consultations undertaken annually, coupled with medium to high self-reported knowledge and confidence in addressing behavioural risk factors, support an increased involvement of surgeons in preventive health practice.

AB BackgroundMethanol poisoning is a serious public health issue in developing countries, but few data are available in the literature on acute kidney injury (AKI) after methanol intoxication.MethodsThis study examined the clinical features, spectrum and outcomes of AKI in patients with methanol intoxication and evaluated the predictors of mortality after methanol intoxication. A total of 50 patients with methanol intoxication were seen at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between 2000 and 2013. Patients were grouped according to the status of renal damage as AKI (n=33) or non-AKI (n=19). Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and mortality data were obtained for analysis.ResultsMost patients were middle-aged (47.814.9years), predominantly male (74.0%), and habitual alcohol consumers (70.0%). Most incidents were oral exposures (96.0%) and unintentional (66.0%). Two (4.0%) patients attempted suicide by intravenous injection of methanol. Five (10.0%) patients suffered methanol intoxication after ingestion of methomyl pesticide that contained methanol as a solvent. Compared to non-AKI patients, the AKI patients were older (50.9 +/- 13.7 versus 41.6 +/- 15.6years, P=0.034), predominantly male (90.9% versus 42.8%, P=0.000), more habitual alcohol users (84.8% versus 41.2%, P=0.001) and had more unintentional exposures (82.8% versus 35.3%, P=0.001). Furthermore, there was a higher incidence of respiratory failure (63.6% versus 29.4%, P=0.022) in the AKI group than in the non-AKI group, respectively. The laboratory studies revealed that the AKI patients suffered from more severe metabolic acidosis than the non-AKI patients. By the end of this study, 13 (39.5%) AKI patients and 1 (5.9%) non-AKI patient had died. The overall in-hospital hospital mortality rate was 28%. In a multivariate binary logistic regression model, it was demonstrated that AKI (odds ratio 19.670, confidence interval 1.026-377.008, P=0.048) and Glasgow coma scale score (odds ratio 1.370, confidence interval 1.079-1.739, P=0.010) were significant factors associated with mortality. The Kaplan-Meier analysis disclosed that AKI patients suffered lower cumulative survival than non-AKI patients (log-rank test, chi-square=5.115, P=0.024).Conclusions AKI was common (66.0%) after methanol intoxication and was predictive of in-hospital hospital mortality. The development of AKI was associated with a 19.670-fold higher risk of in-hospital mortality.

AB BackgroundThe aim of the current study was to explore the factors influencing dental caries among 3-5-year-old children in Sichuan Province and the interrelationship between these factors using structural equation modelling (SEM).MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted among 2746 3-5-year-old children in Sichuan Province. Examination of caries was conducted on all children and a questionnaire was answered by the children's caregiver. SEM alternative models were constructed to interpret the intricate relationships between socio-economic status (SES), caregiver's oral health knowledge, attitudes, children's oral health behaviours and children's dental caries.ResultThe results showed that dental caries were significantly associated with dietary behaviours (=0.11, SE=0.03, P=0.001, BC 95% CI =0.05/0.18) and SES (=-0.17, SE=0.03, P<0.001, BC 95% CI=-0.23/-0.10) directly, While the indirect effect of SES on dmft is in an opposite direction (=0.08, SE=0.02, BC 95% CI=0.04/0.12).ConclusionWe found that unhealthy dietary behaviours increased the prevalence of dental caries. However, oral health knowledge and attitude failed to affect dietary behaviour in this model. This result warns that oral health education should strengthen feeding-related knowledge. Meanwhile, it also reminds that it is easier known than done. Future oral health education should focus on exploring a more effective way for the public to turn knowledge into action.

AB BackgroundObstetrical fistula (OF) is a public health challenge that is among the previously neglected components of maternal health in the developing world. The condition, which in the recent past has increasingly drawn more attention from the public, has a devastating impact on the health and wellbeing of both women and girls worldwide. The most common cause of obstetric fistula in developing countries is prolonged obstructed labor affecting approximately 2 million women and girls across Africa and Asia.The objective of this study was to examine the post-effects of fistula and reintegration strategies of fistula survivors in Uganda.MethodsA descriptive case study design was used to collect data from women aged 15-49years who had experienced OF and been successfully treated/repaired. Data collection was aided by in-depth interview guides designed for collecting qualitative data which was analyzed using thematic and content analysis.ResultsThe study results showed that 45.6% were aged 18-24years, 43% had only primary level education and 55.7% of the women were married. Fistula survivors continue to suffer from shame, rejection, isolation and stigma, trauma and disgrace among other effects even after successful repair/surgery. Some of the reintegration strategies for fistula survivors include; seeking for successful repair, remarriage and relocation from their parent communities to new environments.ConclusionIn addition to capacity building, changing attitudes and strengthening the health system, a comprehensive and holistic fistula care approach is required to facilitate the reintegration process and restoration of women dignity.

We hypothesized that a participatory workplace intervention would increase the level of WSC defined as vertical WSC (i.e. WSC linking together employees and their leaders) and horizontal WSC (i.e. WSC bonding employees together).MethodsWe conducted a secondary data analysis of a cluster randomized controlled trial that was implemented among all employees in 78 municipal Danish pre-schools (44 intervention and 34 control group schools). The study sample consisted of 606 employees, 386 in the intervention and 220 in the control group. The intervention aimed to improve the psychosocial working environment by using a participatory approach and focusing on core job tasks. Vertical and horizontal WSC was measured by five and four items, respectively, at baseline and at 24-months follow-up. We estimated intervention effect by calculating the interaction of change over time by group assignment (intervention versus control group) and included workplace identification number in a repeated statement to take into account that employees were nested within workplaces. We conducted post-hoc analyses to examine whether intervention effect differed by implementation degree.ResultsWSC decreased in both groups. In the main analyses, there was no statistically significant difference between intervention and control group, neither for vertical nor horizontal WSC. However, when we excluded intervention workplaces with a low degree of implementation, we found a statistically significant difference between the intervention and the control group (estimate: 0.25, 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.50, p=0.049), indicating that vertical WSC decreased in the control group and remained stable in the intervention group.ConclusionsThere was not a statistically significant difference between intervention and control group in the main analysis. Post-hoc analyses, however, suggest that the intervention may have prevented a decrease in vertical WSC among employees in workplaces with a high or a medium degree of implementation.A conference abstract with the key results of this study has been previously presented and published, European Journal of Public Health, Volume 28, Issue suppl_4, November 2018, cky260, https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/28/suppl_4/cky260/5187184.Trial registrationISRCTN16271504, retrospectively registered on November 15, 2016.

AB BackgroundMany studies have demonstrated positive effects of physical activity on children's health such as improved cardiorespiratory function and decreased obesity. Physical activity has also been found to have positive effects on academic achievement and cognitive function. However, there are few high quality RCT studies on this topic at present and the findings remain controversial.MethodsThis protocol describes cluster randomized controlled trials assessing the impact of school-based exercise intervention among children in Mongolia. The intervention consists of 3-min sessions of high intensity interval training combined with music implemented two times a week at school during study periods. The participants are children in the fourth grade in public elementary schools in the Sukhbaatar district in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. The participants are cluster randomized by school and allocated either to the intervention or control group. The primary outcome is academic achievement. Secondary outcomes are obesity/overweight, physical fitness function, lifestyle, mental health, and cognitive function.DiscussionThis cluster-RCT is designed and implemented to assess the effectiveness of exercise intervention on academic achievement, cognitive function, and physical and mental health among school-age children in Mongolia. This study will provide evidence to promote physical activities among children in low- and middle- income countries.Trial registrationUMIN: UMIN000031062. Registered on 1st February 2018.

DE Surveillance; Health system; Influenza; ILI; Evaluation; Tunisia
AB BackgroundThis study was initiated to evaluate, for the first time, the performance and quality of the influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance system in Tunisia.MethodsThe evaluation covered the period of 2012-2015 and used different data sources to measure indicators related to data quality and completeness, representativeness, timeliness, simplicity, acceptability, flexibility, stability and utility.ResultsDuring the evaluation period, 485.221 ILI cases were reported among 6.386.621 outpatients at 268 ILI sentinel sites. To conserve resources, cases were only enrolled and tested for influenza during times when the number of patients meeting the ILI case definition exceeded 7% (10% after 2014) of the total number of outpatients for the week. When this benchmark was met, five to 10 patients were enrolled and sampled by nasopharyngeal swabs the following week. In total, The National Influenza Center (NIC) received 2476 samples, of which 683 (27.6%) were positive for influenza. The greatest strength of the system was its representativeness and flexibility. The timeliness of the data and the acceptability of the surveillance system performed moderately well; however, the utility of the data and the stability and simplicity of the surveillance system need improvement. Overall, the performance of the Tunisian influenza surveillance system was evaluated as performing moderately well for situational awareness in the country and for collecting representative influenza virologic samples.ConclusionsThe influenza surveillance system in Tunisia provided pertinent evidence for public health interventions related to influenza situational awareness. To better monitor influenza, we propose that ILI surveillance should be limited to sites that are currently performing well and the quality of data collected should be closely monitored and improved.

AB Background
   Given the growing burden of cardiovascular diseases in sub-Saharan Africa, global donors and governments are exploring strategies for integrating evidence-based cardiovascular diseases prevention into HIV clinics. We assessed the capabilities, motivations and opportunities that exist for HIV clinics to apply evidence-based strategies for hypertension control among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Nigeria.
   Methods
   We used a concurrent Quan-Qual-study approach (a quantitative first step using structured questionnaires followed by a qualitative approach using stakeholder meetings).We invited key stakeholders and representatives of HIV and non-communicable disease organizations in Lagos, Nigeria to 1) assess the capacity of HIV clinics (n = 29) to, and; 2) explore their attitudes and perceptions towards implementing evidence-based strategies for hypertension management in Lagos, Nigeria (n = 19)The quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS whereas responses from the stakeholders meeting were coded and analyzed using thematic approach and an implementation science framework, the COM-B (Capabilities, Opportunities, Motivations and Behavior) model, guided the mapping and interpretation of the data.
   Results
   Out of the 29 HIV clinics that participated in the study, 28 clinics were public, government owned facilities with 394 HIV patients per month with varying capabilities, opportunities and motivations for integrating evidence-based hypertension interventions within their services for PLHIV. Majority of the clinics (n = 26) rated medium-to-low on the psychological capability domains, while most of the clinics (n = 25) rated low on the physical capabilities of integrating evidence-based hypertension interventions within HIV clinics. There was high variability in the ratings for the opportunity domains, with physical opportunities rated high in only eight HIV clinics, two clinics with a medium rating and nineteen clinics with a low rating. Social opportunity domain tended to be rated low in majority of the HIV clinics (n = 21). Lastly, almost all the HIV clinics (n = 23) rated high on the reflective motivation domain although automatic motivations tended to be rated low across the HIV clinics.
   Conclusion
   In this study, we found that with the exception of motivations, the relative capabilities whether physical or psychological and the relative opportunities for integrating evidence based hypertension intervention within HIV clinics in Nigeria were minimal. Thus, there is need to strengthen the HIV clinics in Lagos for the implementation of evidence-based hypertension interventions within HIV clinics to improve patient outcomes and service delivery in Southwest Nigeria.

TI Health seeking behavior among individuals presenting with chronic cough
   at referral hospitals in Uganda; Missed opportunity for early
   tuberculosis diagnosis
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; SERVICE DELAY; CARE; PATIENT
AB Background
   Tuberculosis (TB) is the 9th leading cause of death from a single infectious agent. Patients live in a complex health care system with both formal and informal providers, and it is important that a TB diagnosis is not missed at the first interaction with the health care system. In this study, we highlight the health seeking behavior of patients and missed opportunities for early TB diagnosis for which interventions could be instituted to ensure early TB diagnosis and prompt TB treatment initiation.
   Methods
   This study was nested in a cross-sectional study that assessed the accuracy of different Xpert MTB/Rif implementation strategies in programmatic settings at the referral hospitals in Uganda. We documented the symptom profile of presumptive TB patients and assessed the health seeking behavior of those with chronic cough by calculating proportion of patients that visited each type of health facility and further calculated the odds of being TB positive given the type of health facility initially visited for consultation.
   Results
   A total of 1,863 presumptive TB patients were enrolled of which 979 (54.5%) were male, and 1795 (99.9%) had chronic cough. A total of 1352 (75.4%) had previously sought care for chronic cough, with 805 (59.6%) seeking care from a public health facility followed by private health facility (289; 21.4%). Up to 182 (13.5%) patients visited a drug store for chronic cough. Patients whose first contact was a private health facility were more likely to have a positive GeneXpert test (adjOR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0-1.9; p = 0.047).
   Conclusions
   Chronic cough is a main symptom for many of the presumptive TB patients presenting at referral hospitals, with several patients having to visit the health system more than once before a TB diagnosis is made. This suggests the need for patients to be thoroughly evaluated at first interface with the health care system to ensure prompt diagnosis and treatment initiation. Improved TB diagnosis possibly with the GeneXpert test, at first contact with the health care system has potential to increase TB case finding and break the transmission cycle in the community.

TI Impact of prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines and z-hypnotics on

SO PLOS ONE

AB Many women experience anxiety or sleep disorders during pregnancy and require pharmacological treatment with benzodiazepines (BZDs) or z-hypnotics. Limited information is currently available on how prenatal exposure to these medications affects behavioral problems in children over the long term. Therefore, from a public health perspective, this issue is highly important. The present study aimed to determine whether prenatal exposure to BZDs and z-hypnotics affected externalizing and internalizing behavior problems in children at age 5 years. This study was based on The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study and The Medical Birth Registry of Norway. The final study population included data for 36 401 children, from questionnaires completed by the mothers throughout the 5-year follow up. Children's behaviors were measured at age 5, based on parental responses to The Child Behavior Checklist. Children T-scores of 63 or above were considered to indicate clinically relevant behavior problems. We applied inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and log-binomial regression models to estimate risk ratios (RRs) and bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with censoring weights to account for loss during follow-up. Several sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the main results. The final sample included 273 (0.75%) children that were exposed to BZDs and/or z-hypnotics during pregnancy. The main, IPTW and censoring weighted analyses showed that prenatal exposure to BZD and/or z-hypnotics increased the risks of internalizing behavioral problems (RR: 1.35, 95% CI: 0.73-2.49) and externalizing behavioral problems (RR: 1.51, 95% CI: 0.86-2.64). However, based on sensitivity analyses, we concluded that the risks of displaying externalizing and internalizing problems at 5 years of age did not significantly increase after prenatal exposure to BZDs and/or z-hypnotics. Instead, the sensitivity analyses suggested that residual confounding and selection bias might explain the increased risks observed in the main analyses.

TI Cost outcome analysis of decentralized care for drug-resistant
   tuberculosis in Johannesburg, South Africa
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   Drug resistant-tuberculosis is a growing burden on the South African health care budget. In response the National Department of Health implemented two important strategies in 2011; universal access to drug-sensitivity testing for rifampicin with Xpert MTB/RIF as the first-line diagnostic test for TB; and decentralization of treatment for RR/MDR-TB to improve access and reduce costs of treatment.
   Objective
   Estimate the costs by treatment outcome of decentralized care for rifampicin and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis under routine conditions. The study was set at an outpatient drug resistant-tuberculosis treatment facility at a public academic hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa. During the study period 18-24 month long course treatment was offered for rifampicin-resistant and multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis.
   Methods
   Data are from a prospective observational cohort study. Costs of treatment were estimated from the provider perspective using bottom-up micro-costing. Costs were estimated as patient-level resource use multiplied by the unit cost of the resource. Clinic visits, drugs, laboratory tests, and total days hospitalized were collected from patients' medical records. Staff time was estimated through a time and motion study. A successful treatment outcome was defined as cure or completion of the regimen.
   Results
   We enrolled 124 patients with 52% having a successful outcome. The average total cost/patient for all patients was $3,430 and $4,530 for successfully treated patients. The largest contributors to total cost across all outcomes were drugs (43%) and staff (28%). The average cost to achieve a successful outcome including all patients who started treatment ("production cost") in the cohort is $6,684.
   Conclusions
   Decentralized, outpatient RR/MDR-TB care under South Africa's 2011 strategy costs 74% less per patient than the previous strategy of inpatient care. The treatment cost of RR/MDR-TB is primarily driven by drug and staff costs, which are in turn dependant on treatment length.

TI What would it cost to scale-up private sector engagement efforts for
   tuberculosis care? Evidence from three pilot programs in India
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PUBLIC-PRIVATE; MIX PROJECT; PRACTITIONERS; DISTRICT; HEALTH
AB Background
   Private providers dominate health care in India and provide most tuberculosis (TB) care. Yet efforts to engage private providers were viewed as unsustainably expensive. Three private provider engagement pilots were implemented in Patna, Mumbai and Mehsana in 2014 based on the recommendations in the National Strategic Plan for TB Control, 2012-17. These pilots sought to improve diagnosis and treatment of TB and increase case notifications by offering free drugs and diagnostics for patients who sought care among private providers, and monetary incentives for providers in one of the pilots. As these pilots demonstrated much higher levels of effectiveness than previously documented, we sought to understand program implementation costs and predict costs for their national scale-up.
   Methods and findings
   We developed a common cost structure across these three pilots comprising fixed and variable cost components. We conducted a retrospective, activity-based costing analysis using programmatic data and qualitative interviews with the respective program managers. We estimated the average recurring costs per TB case at different levels of program scale for the three pilots. We used these cost estimates to calculate the budget required for a national scale up of such pilots. The average cost per privately-notified TB case for Patna, Mumbai and Mehsana was estimated to be US$ 95, US$ 110 and US$ 50, respectively, in May 2016 when these pilots were estimated to cover 50%, 36% and 100% of the total private TB patients, respectively. For Patna and Mumbai pilots, the average cost per case at full scale, i.e. 100% coverage of private TB patients, was projected to be US$ 91 and US$ 101, respectively. In comparison, the national TB program's budget for 2015 averages out to $150 per notified TB case. The total annual additional budget for a national scale up of these pilots was estimated to be US$ 267 million.
   Conclusions
   As India seeks to eliminate TB, extensive national engagement of private providers will be required. The cost per privately-notified TB case from these pilots is comparable to that already being spent by the public sector and to the projected cost per privately-notified TB case required to achieve national scale-up of these pilots. With additional funds expected to execute against national TB elimination commitments, the scale-up costs of these operationally viable and effective private provider engagement pilots are likely to be financially viable.

AB Introduction
   A large proportion of children with uncomplicated malaria receive appropriate treatment late, contributing to progression of illness to severe disease. We explored contexts of caregiver delays in seeking appropriate care for children with severe malaria.
   Methods
   This qualitative study was conducted at the Children's Ward of Jinja Hospital, where children with severe malaria were hospitalized. A total of 22in-depth interviews were conducted with caregivers of children hospitalized with severe malaria. Issues explored were formulated based on the Partners for Applied Social Sciences (PASS) model, focusing on facilitators and barriersto caregivers'promptseeking and accessing ofappropriate care. The data were coded deductively using ATLAS. ti (version 7.5). Codes were then grouped into families based on emerging themes.
   Results
   Caregivers' rating of initial symptoms as mild illness lead to delays in response. Use of home initiated interventions with presumably ineffective herbs or medicines was common, leading to further delay. When care was sought outside the home, drug shops were preferred over public health facilities for reasons of convenience. Drug shops often provided sub-optimal care, and thus contributed to delays in access to appropriate care. Public facilities were often a last resort when illness was perceived to be progressing to severe disease. Further delays occurred at health facilities due to inadequate referral systems.
   Conclusion
   Communities living in endemic areas need to be sensitized about the significance of fever, even if mild, as an indicator of malaria. Additionally, amidst ongoing efforts at bringing antimalarial treatment services closer to communities, the value of drug shops as providers ofrationalantimalarialtreatment needs to be reviewed.

TI Fluorescence lateral flow competitive protein binding assay for the

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID NEURAL-TUBE DEFECTS; FOLIC-ACID; OPPORTUNITIES; PREVENTION
AB Folate is a micronutrient required for the production of new cells, making it a key factor in early fetal development and ensuring normal growth and maintenance of health. The increase in consumption of folate due to increased periconceptional supplementation and fortification of grains in many countries has led to a decrease in occurrence of folate deficiency and a class of birth defects called neural tube defects. However, an opportunity remains to further improve folate status of populations in areas with limited access to fortified foods and supplementation. Screening of women of reproductive age and other vulnerable populations for folate status would increase our understanding of the magnitude of the burden of folate deficiency and inform monitoring of public health programs. Current gold standard methods for folate assessment are time-intensive and require cold chain, sophisticated laboratory infrastructure, and highly-trained personnel. Our lateral flow assay is lowcost, easy to use, and allows a user to assess folate insufficiency at the point of care in less than 40 minutes. We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of our assay in 24 human serum samples, including 8 samples with folate concentrations less than 10.0 nmol/L and 14 samples less than 13.4 nmol/L using the Immulite 2000 commercial assay as a reference standard. The sensitivity and specificity were found to be 93% (95% CI: 54.7-100.0) and 91% (95% CI: 80.0-100.0), respectively, when using our test to determine folate insufficiency based on a cutoff of 13.4 nmol/L. Our point-of-care diagnostic test for folate concentrations could inform screening and public health programs in at-risk populations.

TI Differences in the epidemiology of out-of-hospital and in-hospital
   trauma deaths
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article

   MORTALITY; BURDEN; ALCOHOL; TRENDS
AB Background
   Trauma is a leading cause of mortality. Holistic views of trauma systems consider injury as a public health problem that requires efforts in primary, secondary and tertiary prevention. However, the performance of trauma systems is commonly judged on the in-hospital mortality rate. Such a focus misses opportunities to consider all deaths within a population, to understand differences in in-hospital and out-of-hospital trauma deaths and to inform population-level injury prevention efforts. The aim of this study was to provide an epidemiological overview of out-of-hospital and in-hospital trauma deaths in a geographically-defined area over a 10-year period.
   Methods
   We performed a population-based review of out-of-hospital and in-hospital trauma deaths over the period of 01 July 2006 to 30 June 2016 in Victoria, Australia, using data from the National Coronial Information System and the Victorian State Trauma Registry. Temporal trends in population-based incidence rates were evaluated.
   Results
   Over the study period, there were 11,246 trauma deaths, of which 71% were out-of-hospital deaths. Out-of-hospital trauma deaths commonly resulted from intentional self-harm events (50%) and transport events (35%), while in-hospital trauma deaths commonly resulted from low falls (<= 1 metre) (50%). The incidence of overall trauma deaths did not change over the study period (incidence rate ratio 0.998; 95%CI: 0.991, 1.004; P = 0.56).
   Conclusions
   Out-of-hospital deaths accounted for most trauma deaths. Given the notable differences between out-of-hospital and in-hospital trauma deaths, monitoring of all trauma deaths is necessary to inform injury prevention activities and to reduce trauma mortality. The absence of a change in the incidence of both out-of-hospital and in-hospital trauma deaths demonstrates the need for enhanced activities across all aspects of injury prevention.

TI Theoretical integration of user satisfaction and technology acceptance
   of the nursing process information system
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MODEL; HEALTH; QUALITY; SUCCESS
AB Background
   The nursing process system (NPS) is used to establish the nursing process involving assessment, diagnosis, planning, intervention, and evaluation in solving the health problems of patients.
   Objectives
   The factors influencing the use of the NPS by nurses were analyzed based on user satisfaction and technology acceptance within the 3Q (service quality, information quality, and system quality) model.
   Methods
   In this cross-sectional quantitative study, the valid responses of 222 nurses to a questionnaire were obtained; these nurses worked at eight hospitals affiliated with public organizations in Taiwan. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze information quality, system quality, service quality, user satisfaction, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived enjoyment, behavioral attitude, and intention after the nurses had used the NPS system for more than 1 month.
   Results
   Information quality, service quality, and system quality influenced user satisfaction. User satisfaction affected perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived enjoyment and had the highest explanatory power (R-2 = 0.75). Furthermore, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived enjoyment influenced behavioral attitude and intention to use the system. The proposed model explained 53% of the variance in the intention to use the NPS.
   Conclusions
   The relationships between the variables of the 3Q model were successfully used to examine the intention of nurses toward using the NPS. Using the findings of this study, designers and programmers can comprehensively understand the perceptions of nurses and further improve the performance of the NPS.

TI Assessing systemic and non-systemic transmission risk of tick-borne

AB Estimating the tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) infection risk under substantial uncertainties of the vector abundance, environmental condition and human-tick interaction is important for evidence-informed public health intervention strategies. Estimating this risk is computationally challenging since the data we observe, i.e., the human incidence of TBE, is only the final outcome of the tick-host transmission and tick-human contact processes. The challenge also increases since the complex TBE virus (TBEV) transmission cycle involves the non-systemic route of transmission between co-feeding ticks. Here, we describe the hidden Markov transition process, using a novel TBEV transmission-human case reporting cascade model that couples the susceptible-infected compartmental model describing the TBEV transmission dynamics among ticks, animal hosts and humans, with the stochastic observation process of human TBE reporting given infection. By fitting human incidence data in Hungary to the transmission model, we estimate key parameters relevant to the tick-host interaction and tick-human transmission. We then use the parametrized cascade model to assess the transmission potential of TBEV in the enzootic cycle with respect to the climate change, and to evaluate the contribution of non-systemic transmission. We show that the TBEV transmission potential in the enzootic cycle has been increasing along with the increased temperature though the TBE human incidence has dropped since 1990s, emphasizing the importance of persistent public health interventions. By demonstrating that non-systemic transmission pathway is a significant factor in the transmission of TBEV in Hungary, we conclude that the risk of TBE infection will be highly underestimated if the non-systemic transmission route is neglected in the risk assessment.

AB BackgroundThe Republic of Moldova is faced with a high prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) related to lifestyle and health behavioural factors. Within the frame of the decentralisation reform, the primary health care system has been tasked to play an important role in the provision of preventative and curative NCD health services. There is however limited evidence available on the actual coverage and quality of care provided. Our paper aims to provide an updated overview of the coverage and quality of service provision in rural and urban regions of Moldova.MethodsWe designed a facility-based survey to measure aspects of coverage and quality of care of NCD services across 20 districts of the Republic of Moldova. This study presents descriptive data on the structural, procedural and clinical aspects of primary healthcare delivery at health centre and family doctor office level. Adjacent private pharmacies were also assessed for the availability of essential NCD medicine.ResultsOrganised under the WHO Health Systems Framework, our findings highlight that service provision and information were generally the strongest among the six health systems building blocks, with more weaknesses found in the area of the health workforce, medical products, financing, and leadership/governance. Urban facilities generally fared better across all indicators.ConclusionsThe gaps in service provision identified by this study require broad health system improvements to ensure NCD related policies and strategies are embedded in primary health care service provision. This likely calls for stronger coordination and collaboration between the public and private sectors and the different levels of government working towards ensuring universal health coverage in Moldova.

AB BackgroundDengue is becoming a major public health concern in Guangdong (GD) Province of China. The problem was highlighted in 2014 by an unprecedented explosive outbreak, where the number of cases was larger than the total cases in previous 30 years. The present study aimed to clarify the spatial and temporal patterns of this dengue outbreak.MethodsBased on the district/county-level epidemiological, demographic and geographic data, we first used Moran's I statistics and Spatial scan method to uncover spatial autocorrelation and clustering of dengue incidence, and then estimated the spatial distributions of mosquito ovitrap index (MOI) by using inverse distance weighting. We finally employed a multivariate time series model to quantitatively decompose dengue cases into endemic, autoregressive and spatiotemporal components.ResultsThe results indicated that dengue incidence was highly spatial-autocorrelated with the inclination of clustering and nonuniformity. About 12 dengue clusters were discovered around Guangzhou and Foshan with significant differences by district/county, where the most likely cluster with the largest relative risk located in central Guangzhou in October. Three significant high-MOI areas were observed around Shaoguan, Qingyuan, Shanwei and Guangzhou. It was further found the districts in Guagnzhou and Foshan were prone to local autoregressive transmission, and most region in southern and central GD exhibited higher endemic components. Moreover, nearly all of districts/counties (especially the urban area) have cases that were infected in adjacent regions.ConclusionsThe study can help to clarify the heterogeneity and the associations of dengue transmission in space and time, and thus provide useful information for public health authorities to plan dengue control strategies.

AB BackgroundLung function is lower in people with disadvantaged socio-economic position (SEP) and is associated with hazardous health behaviours and exposures. The associations are likely to be interactive, for example, exposure to socially patterned environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in childhood is associated with an increased effect of smoking in adulthood. We hypothesise that disadvantaged childhood SEP increases susceptibility to the effects of hazards in adulthood for lung function. We test whether disadvantaged childhood SEP moderates smoking, physical activity, obesity, occupational exposures, ETS and air pollution's associations with lung function.MethodsData are from the Nurse Health Assessment (NHA) in waves two and three of the United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS). Analysis is restricted to English residents aged at least 20 for women and 25 for men, producing a study population of 16,339. Lung function is measured with forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and standardised to the percentage of expected FEV1 for a healthy non-smoker of equivalent age, gender, height and ethnicity (FEV1%). Using STATA 14, a mixed linear model was fitted with interaction terms between childhood SEP and health behaviours and occupational exposures. Cross level interactions tested whether childhood SEP moderated household ETS and neighbourhood air pollution's associations with FEV1%.ResultsSEP, smoking, physical activity, obesity, occupational exposures and air pollution were associated with lung function. Interaction terms indicated a significantly stronger negative association between disadvantaged childhood SEP and currently smoking (coefficient -6.47 %, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 9.51 %, 3.42 %) as well as with formerly smoking and occupational exposures. Significant interactions were not found with physical activity, obesity, ETS and air pollution.ConclusionThe findings suggest that disadvantaged SEP in childhood may make people's lung function more susceptible to the negative effects of smoking and occupational exposures in adulthood. This is important as those most likely to encounter these exposures are at greater risk to their effects. Policy to alleviate this inequality requires intervention in health behaviours through public health campaigns and in occupational health via health and safety legislation.

AB BackgroundExpansion of provider-initiated testing and counselling (PITC) is one strategy to increase accessibility of HIV testing services. Insufficient human resources was identified as a primary barrier to increasing PITC coverage in Zimbabwe. We evaluated if deployment of supplemental PITC providers at public facilities in Zimbabwe was associated with increased numbers of individuals tested and diagnosed with HIV.MethodsFrom July 2016 to May 2017, International Training and Education Center for Health (I-TECH) deployed 138 PITC providers to supplement existing ministry healthcare workers offering PITC at 249 facilities. These supplemental providers were assigned to facilities on a weekly basis. Each week, I-TECH providers reported the number of HIV tests and positive diagnoses they performed. Using routine reporting systems, we obtained from each facility the number of clients tested and diagnosed with HIV per month. Including data both before and during the intervention period, and utilizing the weekly variability in placement locations of the supplemental PITC providers, we employed generalized estimating equations to assess if the placement of supplemental PITC providers at a facility was associated with a change in facility outputs.ResultsSupplemental PITC providers performed an average of 62 (SD=52) HIV tests per week and diagnosed 4.4 (SD=4.9) individuals with HIV per week. However, using facility reports from the same period, we found that each person-week of PITC provider deployment at a facility was associated with an additional 16.7 (95% CI, 12.2-21.1) individuals tested and an additional 0.9 (95% CI, 0.5-1.2) individuals diagnosed with HIV. We also found that staff placement at clinics was associated with a larger increase in HIV testing than staff placement at polyclinics or hospitals (24.0 vs. 9.8; p<0.001).ConclusionsThis program resulted in increased numbers of individuals tested and diagnosed with HIV. The discrepancy between the average weekly HIV tests conducted by supplemental PITC providers (62) and the increase in facility-level HIV tests associated with one week of PITC provider deployment (16.7) suggests that supplemental PITC providers displaced existing staff who may have been reassigned to fulfil other duties at the facility.

AB BackgroundA hospitalized patient's length of stay (LOS) can have a significant impact on the performance and operating costs of a healthcare facility. Among pediatric patients, traumatic injuries are common causes of emergency room visits and hospitalizations. In Saudi Arabia, little is known about the burden of pediatric traumas on population health and the healthcare facilities. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the associations between traumatic pediatric injury mechanisms and extended LOS in a trauma center.MethodsData was obtained from the trauma registry. From 2001 to 2018, trauma patients between the ages of 0 and 18years old with LOSs of >0days were analyzed. The independent variable was the injury mechanism, which was classified as follows: falls, burns, drowning, motor vehicle collisions, motorcycle collisions, pedestrian, and intentional injuries. The dependent variable was an extended LOS defined as 21days. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the associations between the injury mechanisms and an extended LOS.ResultsA total of 5563 pediatric patients were included in this study. Of those, 774 (14%) had extended LOSs. Those patients with extended LOSs suffered more severe injuries than those with short hospital stays as measured by the Injury Severity Score (mean scores: 15.4 vs. 6.8, p<0.01), the Glasgow Coma Scale score (mean scores: 10.4 vs, 14.0, p<0.01), and the Revised Trauma Score (mean scores: 9.9 vs. 11.0, p<0.01). Approximately one half of the patients with extended LOSs were admitted due to motor vehicle injuries. In addition, those patients were almost five times more likely to have extended LOSs than the patients who suffered fall injuries (odds ratio: 4.8, 95% confidence interval: 3.2-7.1).ConclusionsBased on the study results, motor vehicle injuries were significantly associated with extended hospitalizations. Prevention is instrumental for reducing healthcare utilization; therefore, these findings call for public health professionals and policymakers to plan, design, and implement preventive measures to reduce the traffic injury burden. In addition, increased traffic law enforcement, such as the use of car restraints, is warranted to reduce the preventable injuries and improve the overall population health.

TI A short history of time use research; implications for public health
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH

DT Article
DE Physical activity; Time use; Public health; History
ID PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; SEDENTARY BEHAVIOR; CHILDREN; SLEEP; YOUTH
AB BackgroundThis section defined time use (TU) research, illustrating its relevance for public health. TUR in the health context is the study of health-enhancing and health-compromising behaviours that are assessed across a 24hday. The central measurement is the use of Time Use Diaries, which capture 24-48h, typically asking about behaviour in each 15-min period. TUR is used for understanding correlates of health behaviours, and as a form of population surveillance, assessing behavioural trends over time.Main bodyThis paper is a narrative review examining the history of time use research, and the potential uses of TU data for public health research. The history of TUR started in studies of the labour force and patterns of work in the late 19th and early twentieth century, but has more recently been applied to examining health issues. Initial studies had a more economic purpose but over recent decades, TU data have been used to describe the distribution and correlates of health-enhancing patterns of human time use. These studies require large multi-country population data sets, such as the harmonised Multinational Time Use Study hosted at the University of Oxford. TU data are used in physical activity research, as they provide information across the 24-hday, that can be examined as time spent sleeping, sitting/standing/light activity, and time spent in moderate-vigorous activities. TU data are also used for sleep research, examining eating and dietary patterns, exploring geographic distributions in time use behaviours, examining mental health and subjective wellbeing, and examining these data over time. The key methodological challenge has been the development of harmonised methods, so population TU data sets can be compared within and between-countries and over time.ConclusionsTUR provides new methods for examining public health research questions where a temporal dimension is important. These time use surveys have provided unique data over decades and in many countries that can be compared. They can be used for examining the effects of some large public health interventions or policies within and between countries.

AB BackgroundIn 2014, Alberta, Canada broke new ground in having the first provincial healthcare policy and procedure for advance care planning (ACP), the process of communicating and documenting a person's future healthcare preferences. However, to date public participation and awareness of ACP remains limited. The aim of this initiative was to elicit community group perspectives on how to help people learn about and participate in ACP.MethodsTargeted invitations were sent to over 300 community groups in Alberta (e.g. health/disease, seniors/retirement, social/service, legal, faith-based, funeral planning, financial, and others). Sixty-seven participants from 47 community groups attended a World Cafe. Participants moved between tables at fixed time intervals, and in small groups discussed three separate ACP-related questions. Written comments were captured by participants and facilitators. Each comment was coded according to Michie et al.'s Theoretical Domains Framework, and mapped to the Capability, Opportunity and Motivation behavior change system (COM-B) in order to identify candidate intervention strategies.ResultsOf 800 written comments, 76% mapped to the Opportunity: Physical COM-B component of behavior, reflecting a need for access to ACP resources. The most common intervention functions identified pertained to Education, Environmental Restructuring, Training, and Enablement. We synthesized the intervention functions and qualitative comments into eight recommendations for engaging people in ACP. These pertain to access to informational resources, group education and facilitation, health system processes, use of stories, marketing, integration into life events, inclusion of business partners, and harmonization of terminology.ConclusionsThere was broad support for the role of community groups in promoting ACP. Eight recommendations for engaging the public in ACP were generated and have been shared with stakeholders.

AB BackgroundOver the last 150years, advanced economies have seen the burden of disease shift to non-communicable diseases. The risk factors for these diseases are often co-morbidities associated with unhealthy weight. The prevalence of overweight/obesity among adults in the advanced countries of the English-speaking world is currently more than two-thirds of the adult population. However, while much attention has concentrated on changes in diet that might have provoked this rapid increase in unhealthy weight, changes in patterns of eating have received little attention.MethodsThis article examines a sequence of large-scale, time use surveys in urban Australia stretching from 1974 to 2006. The earliest survey in 1974 (conducted by the Cities Commission) was limited to respondents aged between 18 and 69years, while the later surveys (by the Australian Bureau of Statistics) included all adult (15years of age or over) living private dwellings. Since time use surveys capture every activity in a day, they contain much information about mealtimes and the patterns of eating. This includes duration of eating, number of eating occasions and the timing of eating. Inferential statistics were used to test the statistical significance of these changes and the size of the effects.ResultsThe eating patterns of urban Australian adults have changed significantly over a 32-year period and the magnitude of this change is non-trivial. Total average eating time as main activity has diminished by about a third, as have eating occasions, affecting particularly luncheon and evening meals. However, there is evidence that eating as secondary activity that accompanies another activity is now almost as frequent as eating at mealtimes. Moreover, participants seem not to report it.ConclusionsContemporary urban Australians are spending less time in organized shared meals. These changes have occurred the over same period during which there has been a public health concern about the prevalence of unhealthy weight. Preliminary indications are that societies that emphasize eating as a commensal, shared activity through maintaining definite, generous lunch breaks and prioritizing eating at mealtimes, achieve better public health outcomes. This has implications for a strategy of health promotion, but to be sure of this we need to study countries with these more socially organized eating patterns.

AB BackgroundPositive youth development (PYD) models are effective in improving adolescent sexual health. Adolescent programs including peer educators, parents and the wider community also demonstrate effectiveness in improving sexual health outcomes. An innovative Positive Adolescent Sexual Health (PASH) Conference model has been introduced in Northern NSW, Australia. It is run by the North Coast PASH Consortium, which is based on a health promotion framework. It takes a positive and holistic approach to sexual health education, and incorporates peer educators, parents, community workers and teachers. This study provides an introductory evaluation of the PASH Conference and identifies areas for increased effectiveness. It is intended as an early piece of research to inform future evaluations and to provide introductory information for public health educators.MethodsData collection included semi-structured interviews with 13 key stakeholders of the PASH Conference. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using deductive thematic analysis.ResultsSubjects included 2 teachers, 2 parents, 2 youth conference workers, 2 organisers, 2 presenters and 3 Peer Educators engaging Peers (PEEPs). Stakeholders perceived that young people were engaged to strengthen their sexual health and wellbeing due to many factors. These followed 3 themes: a safe and open learning environment, empowerment of young people and involvement of the support system and broader community. Multiple recommendations were identified across 2 themes: changes to conference format and planning, and enhancing stakeholder engagement.DiscussionThe PASH Conference is a promising new youth development design promoting positive adolescent sexual health, which may provide a feasible model for public health educators to trial. Elements of the conference identified as engaging to youth align well with those in PYD research literature. This study provides an early piece of research to inform the design of future research on the PASH Conference including evaluation of behavioural outcomes. It provides introductory information to inform PASH Conference development to further increase its effectiveness.

AB BackgroundThe total number of people with dementia is increasing worldwide, due to our aging society. Without a disease-modifying drug available, risk reduction strategies are to date the only promising way to reduce dementia incidence in the future. Substantial evidence exists that lifestyle factors contribute to the risk of dementia, such as physical exercise, mental activity and (non-)smoking. Still, most people seem unaware of a relationship between lifestyle and brain health. This paper investigates dementia literacy and knowledge of modifiable risk and protective factors of dementia in a Dutch population-based sample.MethodsAn online-survey was carried out among 590 community-dwelling people between 40 and 75years old in the Province of Limburg, the Netherlands. The total group comprises both of a provincial sample (n=381) and a sample of three specific districts within the province (n=209). Dementia awareness and knowledge about 12 risk and protective factors was assessed with items derived from the British Social Attitudes (BSA) survey, supplemented with custom items developed by the research team.ResultsThe majority of participants (56%) were unaware of a relationship between lifestyle and dementia risk. Most individuals identified low cognitive activity, physical inactivity and unhealthy diet as dementia risk factors. Particular gaps in knowledge existed with regard to major cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and coronary heart disease. Although the level of awareness varied by age and level of education, most people (70%) were eager to learn more about the topic of brain health, and indicated to be interested in using eHealth (54%) to measure or improve brain health.ConclusionsMost people still are unaware of the relation between lifestyle and brain health, indicating the need for public health campaigns. Increasing awareness in the general population about the presence of modifiable dementia risk and protective factors is a crucial first step prior to implementation of preventative measures. Targeting specific subgroups, such as individuals with low socioeconomic status and low health literacy, is essential for the reach and effect of a prevention campaign. Outcome of this study was the rationale for an awareness campaign in The Netherlands, called MijnBreincoach (MyBraincoach).

AB BackgroundThe last few years have seen renewed interest in use-of-time recalls in epidemiological studies, driven by a focus on the 24-hday [including sleep, sitting, and light physical activity (LPA)] rather than just moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). This paper describes four different computerised use-of-time instruments (ACT24, PAR, MARCA and cpar24) and presents population time-use data from a collective sample of 8286 adults from different population studies conducted in Australia/New Zealand, Germany and the United States.MethodsThe instruments were developed independently but showed a number of similarities: they were self-administered through the web or used computer-assisted telephone interviews; all captured energy expenditure using variants of the Ainsworth Compendium; each had been validated against criterion measures; and they used a domain structure whereby activities were aggregated under categories such as Personal Care and Work.ResultsEstimates of physical activity level (average daily rate of energy expenditure in METs) ranged from 1.53 to 1.78 in the four studies, strikingly similar to population estimates derived from doubly labelled water. There was broad agreement in the amount of time spent in sleep (7.2-8.6h), MVPA (1.6-3.1h), personal care (1.6-2.4h), and transportation (1.1-1.8h). There were consistent sex differences, with women spending 28-81% more time on chores, 8-40% more time in LPA, and 3-39% less time in MVPA than men.ConclusionsAlthough there were many similarities between instruments, differences in operationalizing definitions of sedentary behaviour and LPA resulted in substantive differences in the amounts of time reported in sedentary and physically active behaviours. Future research should focus on deriving a core set of basic activities and associated energy expenditure estimates, an agreed classificatory hierarchy for the major behavioural and activity domains, and systems to capture relevant social and environmental contexts.

AB BackgroundReproductive health is a part of a comprehensive definition of complete physical, mental and social well-being. Sex education is an important aspect of public health. Ignorance, due to the lack of sex education leads to risky sexual behaviors.Methods: Our cross-sectional study was aimed at investigating a representative group of Polish women's knowledge about the physiology of the menstrual cycle, contraceptive methods, infertility and cervical cancer prevention. The data were collected by face-to-face interviews and an anonymous electronic questionnaire.ResultsThe study group involved 20,002 respondents. Most of the women were of reproductive age (mean 27.7), parous (60.8%), of higher education (71%) and living in large cities (>500k citizens, 36.8%). 62.2% of the women gave correct answers to at least 5 of 7 questions concerning the physiology of the menstrual cycle. Three factors had a significant influence on the number of correct answers: higher education (p=0.0001), more frequent gynecological appointments (p=0.0001) and living in a larger city (p=0.002).Women of higher education level had more often used some form of contraceptive method previously (87% vs. 78.4%, p=0.001), recommended natural family planning methods to their peers (18.4% vs. 15%, p=0.001) and regularly attended gynecological appointments (85.7% vs. 78.8%, p=0.001) when compared with those women with lower educational levels. The three most effective contraceptive methods identified by respondents were: oral contraceptives (71.1% answers), intrauterine devices (50.2%) and parenteral hormonal contraceptives (30.4%). The effectiveness of natural family planning was more often emphasized by women who had never used any contraceptives before (20.1% vs 6.7%). Most of the participants (80.8%) believed that in-vitro fertilization is an effective infertility treatment and should be reimbursed in Poland. Also, 95.2% of the respondents reported that they had undergone a Papanicolaou test within the past 3years, but only 3% of these women were aware of all the risk factors for cervical cancer mentioned in our survey.ConclusionsIt is very important to improve comprehensive reproductive health education in Poland, especially among women of lower educational levels and living in small centers. In future, educational programs and gynecologists should focus on implementing and improving these aforementioned issues.

AB The largest ever recorded epidemic of the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) broke out in 2004 and affected four continents. Acute symptomatic infections are typically associated with the onset of fever and often debilitating polyarthralgia/polyarthritis. In this study, a systems biology approach was adopted to analyze the blood transcriptomes of adults acutely infected with the CHIKV. Gene signatures that were associated with viral RNA levels and the onset of symptoms were identified. Among these genes, the putative role of the Eukaryotic Initiation Factor (eIF) family genes and apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC3A) in the CHIKV replication process were displayed. We further compared these signatures with signatures induced by the Dengue virus infection and rheumatoid arthritis. Finally, we demonstrated that the CHIKV in vitro infection of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages induced IL-1 beta production in a mechanism that is significantly dependent on the inflammasome NLRP3 activation. The observations provided valuable insights into virus-host interactions during the acute phase and can be instrumental in the investigation of new and effective therapeutic interventions.
   Author summary The Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has infected millions of people worldwide and presents a serious public health issue. Acute symptomatic infections caused by contracting this mosquito-transmitted arbovirus are typically associated with an abrupt onset of fever and often debilitating polyarthralgia/ polyarthritis, as well as prolonged periods of disability in some patients. These dramatic effects call for a careful evaluation of the molecular mechanisms involved in this puzzling infection. By analyzing the blood transcriptome of adults acutely infected with CHIKV, we were able to provide a detailed picture of the early molecular events induced by the infection. Additionally, the systems biology approach revealed genes that can be investigated extensively as probable therapeutic targets for the disease.

TI Bridging the gap between HIV epidemiology and antiretroviral resistance
   evolution: Modelling the spread of resistance in South Africa
SO PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID DRUG-RESISTANCE; THERAPY; MONOTHERAPY; DIAGNOSIS; ADULTS
AB The scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in South Africa substantially reduced AIDS-related deaths and new HIV infections. However, its success is threatened by the emergence of resistance to non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). The MARISA (Modelling Antiretroviral drug Resistance In South Africa) model presented here aims at investigating the time trends and factors driving NNRTI resistance in South Africa. MARISA is a compartmental model that includes the key aspects of the local HIV epidemic: continuum of care, disease progression, and gender. The dynamics of NNRTI resistance emergence and transmission are then added to this framework. Model parameters are informed using data from HIV cohorts participating in the International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) and literature estimates, or fitted to UNAIDS estimates. Using this novel approach of triangulating clinical and resistance data from various sources, MARISA reproduces the time trends of HIV in South Africa in 2005-2016, with a decrease in new infections, undiagnosed individuals, and AIDS-related deaths. MARISA captures the dynamics of the spread of NNRTI resistance: high levels of acquired drug resistance (ADR, in 83% of first-line treatment failures in 2016), and increasing transmitted drug resistance (TDR, in 8.1% of ART initiators in 2016). Simulation of counter-factual scenarios reflecting alternative public health policies shows that increasing treatment coverage would have resulted in fewer new infections and deaths, at the cost of higher TDR (11.6% in 2016 for doubling the treatment rate). Conversely, improving switching to second-line treatment would have led to lower TDR (6.5% in 2016 for doubling the switching rate) and fewer new infections and deaths. Implementing drug resistance testing would have had little impact. The rapid ART scale-up and inadequate switching to second-line treatment were the key drivers of the spread of NNRTI resistance in South Africa. However, even though some interventions could have substantially reduced the level of NNRTI resistance, no policy including NNRTI-based first line regimens could have prevented this spread. Thus, by combining epidemiological data on HIV in South Africa with biological data on resistance evolution, our modelling approach identified key factors driving NNRTI resistance, highlighting the need of alternative first-line regimens.
   Author summary Resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) threatens the long-term success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) roll-out in South Africa. We developed a compartmental model integrating the local HIV epidemiology with biological mechanisms of drug resistance. A first dimension of the model accounts for the continuum of care: infection, diagnosis, first-line treatment with suppression or failure, and second-line treatment. Other dimensions include: disease progression (CD4 counts), gender, and acquisition and transmission of NNRTI resistance. Whenever possible, we informed the parameters using the data available from local cohorts. Other parameters were informed using literature or UNAIDS estimates. The model captured the rise of NNRTI resistance during the period. We assessed the impact of counter-factual scenarios reflecting alternative countrywide policies during the period 2005 to 2016, considering either increasing ART coverage, improving management of treatment failure, broadening ART eligibility, or implementing drug resistance testing before ART initiation. We identified key drivers of the NNRTI resistance epidemic: large-scale ART roll-out and insufficient monitoring of first-line treatment failure. The model also suggested that no policy including NNRTI-based first line regimens could have prevented the spread of NNRTI resistance.

AB Chronic pain is highly prevalent worldwide and represents a significant socioeconomic and public health burden. Several aspects of chronic pain, for example back pain and a severity-related phenotype chronic pain grade', have been shown previously to be complex heritable traits with a polygenic component. Additional pain-related phenotypes capturing aspects of an individual's overall sensitivity to experiencing and reporting chronic pain have also been suggested as a focus for investigation. We made use of a measure of the number of sites of chronic pain in individuals within the UK general population. This measure, termed Multisite Chronic Pain (MCP), is a complex trait and its genetic architecture has not previously been investigated. To address this, we carried out a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of MCP in similar to 380,000 UK Biobank participants. Our findings were consistent with MCP having a significant polygenic component, with a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) heritability of 10.2%. In total 76 independent lead SNPs at 39 risk loci were associated with MCP. Additional gene-level association analyses identified neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, nervous system development, cell-cycle progression and apoptosis genes as enriched for genetic association with MCP. Genetic correlations were observed between MCP and a range of psychiatric, autoimmune and anthropometric traits, including major depressive disorder (MDD), asthma and Body Mass Index (BMI). Furthermore, in Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses a causal effect of MCP on MDD was observed. Additionally, a polygenic risk score (PRS) for MCP was found to significantly predict chronic widespread pain (pain all over the body), indicating the existence of genetic variants contributing to both of these pain phenotypes. Overall, our findings support the proposition that chronic pain involves a strong nervous system component with implications for our understanding of the physiology of chronic pain. These discoveries may also inform the future development of novel treatment approaches.
   Author summary Chronic pain is common worldwide and imposes a significant burden from a public health and socioeconomic perspective. The reasons why some individuals develop chronic pain and others do not are not fully understood. In this study we searched for genetic variants associated with chronic pain in a large general-population cohort. We also assessed how this genetic variation was correlated with a range of other diseases and traits, such as depression and BMI, and we tested for causal relationships between depression and chronic pain. We found that chronic pain was associated with several genes involved in brain function and development and was correlated with mental health and autoimmune traits (including depression, PTSD and asthma). We also found evidence for causal relationships between chronic pain and major depressive disorder. This work provides new insights into the genetics and underlying biology of chronic pain and may help to inform new treatment strategies.

AB Pathogenic Salmonella strains that cause gastroenteritis are able to colonize and replicate within the intestines of multiple host species. In general, these strains have retained an ability to form the rdar morphotype, a resistant biofilm physiology hypothesized to be important for Salmonella transmission. In contrast, Salmonella strains that are host-adapted or even host-restricted like Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, tend to cause systemic infections and have lost the ability to form the rdar morphotype. Here, we investigated the rdar morphotype and CsgD-regulated biofilm formation in two non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) strains that caused invasive disease in Malawian children, S. Typhimurium D23580 and S. Enteritidis D7795, and compared them to a panel of NTS strains associated with gastroenteritis, as well as S. Typhi strains. Sequence comparisons combined with luciferase reporter technology identified key SNPs in the promoter region of csgD that either shut off biofilm formation completely (D7795) or reduced transcription of this key biofilm regulator (D23580). Phylogenetic analysis showed that these SNPs are conserved throughout the African clades of invasive isolates, dating as far back as 80 years ago. S. Typhi isolates were negative for the rdar morphotype due to truncation of eight amino acids from the C-terminus of CsgD. We present new evidence in support of parallel evolution between lineages of nontyphoidal Salmonella associated with invasive disease in Africa and the archetypal host-restricted invasive serovar; S. Typhi. We hypothesize that the African invasive isolates are becoming human-adapted and niche specialized' with less reliance on environmental survival, as compared to gastroenteritis-causing isolates.
   Author summary African clades of nontyphoidal Salmonella cause invasive disease on a daily basis and thousands of deaths each year. Although it is generally accepted that the transmission route for these organisms is fecal-oral, we know very little about their behaviour in the environment between hosts. In this paper, we have identified both a genotype and a phenotype that suggest environmental niche specialization that is distinct from lineages of Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Enteritidis associated with industrialized food supply chains in resource-rich settings. We also compared with strains of Salmonella Typhi, which cause systemic typhoid fever infections exclusively in humans. In each invasive lineage, regulatory or structural gene mutations leading to loss or impairment of biofilm were identified, all associated with curli and cellulose production, the two main structures that comprise the biofilm matrix. This suggests that similar evolutionary pressures are acting on invasive Salmonella isolates. Public health strategies aimed at reducing the burden of invasive Salmonella disease must prevent transmission to vulnerable adults and children via water sanitation and hygiene practices-a process that starts with identification of environmental reservoirs. The results of our study will raise the profile of this neglected aspect of invasive salmonellosis and will challenge researchers and clinicians to search in new places for potential environmental reservoirs of these pathogens.

AB Background The control of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is facilitated by knowledge of factors associated with the treatment failures in endemic countries. The aim of this evaluation was to identify the potential risk determinants which might affect the significance of demographic and clinical characteristics for the patients with anthroponotic CL (ACL) and the outcome of meglumine antimoniate (MA) (Glucantime) treatment.
   Methodology/Principal findings This current was executed as a cohort spanning over a period of 5 years which centered in southeastern part of Iran. Altogether, 2,422 participants were evaluated and 1,391 eligible volunteer patients with ACL caused by Leishmania tropica were included. Overall, 1,116 (80.2%) patients received MA intraleisionally (IL), once a week for 12 weeks along with biweekly cryotherapy, while 275 (19.8%) patients received MA alone (20 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks) (intramuscular, IM). The treatment failure rate in ACL patients was 11% using IL combined with cryotherapy plus IM alone, whilst 9% and 18.5% by IL along with cryotherapy or IM alone, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression model predicted 5 major associated-risk determinants including male (odds ratio (OR) = 1.54, confidence interval (CI) = 1.079-2.22, p = 0.018), lesion on face (OR = 1.574, CI = 1.075-2.303, p = 0.02), multiple lesions (OR = 1.446, CI = 1.008-2.075, p = 0.045), poor treatment adherence (OR = 2.041, CI = 1.204-3.46, p = 0.008) and disease duration > 4 months (OR = 2.739, CI = 1.906-3.936, p <= 0.001).
   Conclusions/Significance The present study is the original and largest cohort of ACL patients who treated with MA. A comprehensive intervention and coordinated action by the health authorities and policy-makers are crucial to make sure that patients strictly follow medical instructions. Early detection and effective therapy < 4 months following the onset of the lesion is critical for successful treatment of the patients. Since a significant number of patients are still refractory to MA, reducing man-vector exposure and development of new effective alternative drugs are essential measures against ACL due to L. tropica.
   Author summary Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a serious neglected tropical disease with social stigma and associated disfiguring with health burden, especially in poor endemic regions of the world. Iran is among the seven high burden CL-infected countries. Limited data are available in regarding to CL treatment and related risk determinants. Parasitologically confirmed ACL patients caused by Leishmania tropica were treated over a 5-year period (2012-2016), with IL meglumine antimoniate (MA) (Glucantime), combined with cryotherapy or with IM MA alone. The objective of this study was to identify the potential risk factors that are associated with response to treatment. The ensuing results with both therapeutic routes identified 5 major risk determinants namely male patients, lesion on face, multiple lesions, poor treatment regimen and disease duration >4 months. The extent to which medical instructions related to patients, therapy and the healthcare system should be seriously monitored. This requires multidisciplinary actions to address specific barriers which directly threaten the treatment outcome. Furthermore, early detection and prompt treatment <4 months following the disease duration together with implementations of public health education and prophylactic measures should receive priority in high risk areas.

AB Background Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis is a cause of both poultry- and egg-associated enterocolitis globally and bloodstream-invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella (iNTS) disease in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA). Distinct, multi-drug resistant genotypes associated with iNTS disease in sSA have recently been described, often requiring treatment with fluoroquinolone antibiotics. In industrialised countries, antimicrobial use in poultry production has led to frequent fluoroquinolone resistance amongst globally prevalent enterocolitis-associated lineages.
   Methodology/Principal findings Twenty seven S. Enteritidis isolates from patients with iNTS disease and two poultry isolates, collected between 2007 and 2015 in the Ashanti region of Ghana, were whole-genome sequenced. These isolates, notable for a high rate of diminished ciprofloxacin susceptibility (DCS), were placed in the phyletic context of 1,067 sequences from the Public Health England (PHE) S. Enteritidis genome database to understand whether DCS was associated with African or globally-circulating clades of S. Enteritidis. Analysis showed four of the major S. Enteritidis clades were represented, two global and two African. All thirteen DCS isolates, containing a single gyrA mutation at codon 87, belonged to a global PT4-like clade responsible for epidemics of poultry-associated enterocolitis. Apart from two DCS isolates, which clustered with PHE isolates associated with travel to Spain and Brazil, the remaining DCS isolates, including one poultry isolate, belonged to two monophyletic clusters in which gyrA 87 mutations appear to have developed within the region.
   Conclusions/Significance Extensive phylogenetic diversity is evident amongst iNTS disease-associated S. Enteritidis in Ghana. Antimicrobial resistance profiles differed by clade, highlighting the challenges of devising empirical sepsis guidelines. The detection of fluoroquinolone resistance in phyletically-related poultry and human isolates is of major concern and surveillance and control measures within the region's burgeoning poultry industry are required to protect a human population at high risk of iNTS disease.
   Author summary Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis is both a prominent global cause of zoonotic gastroenteritis, in association with the industrial production of eggs and poultry, and of bloodstream-invasive infection in sub-Saharan Africa, a clinical syndrome referred to as invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella (iNTS) disease. African epidemic iNTS strains are frequently multi-drug resistant, leaving fluoroquinolone antibiotics as key agents in reducing iNTS-associated morbidity and mortality. We analysed the genomes of S. Enteritidis collected in Ghana from patients with iNTS disease to investigate the emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance in the region. Extensive phylogenetic diversity was present, however, fluoroquinolone resistance was confined to a single clade causing global epidemics of poultry-associated gastroenteritis. This resistance has predominantly emerged locally, rather than being imported. We found that antimicrobial resistance patterns differed by S. Enteritidis clade, highlighting the challenges of devising empirical sepsis treatment guidelines in the absence of diagnostic microbiology facilities to monitor changes in resistance profiles. Furthermore, we detected fluoroquinolone resistance in closely related poultry and human isolates, suggesting a role of antimicrobial use within the growing local poultry industry in driving the emergence of resistance and a need for surveillance measures within this industry to protect a human population at high risk of iNTS disease.

AB Background In 2015, Singapore had the first and only reported foodborne outbreak of invasive disease caused by the group B Streptococcus (GBS; Streptococcus agalactiae). Disease, predominantly septic arthritis and meningitis, was associated with sequence type (ST)283, acquired from eating raw farmed freshwater fish. Although GBS sepsis is well-described in neonates and older adults with co-morbidities, this outbreak affected non-pregnant and younger adults with fewer co-morbidities, suggesting greater virulence. Before 2015 ST283 had only been reported from twenty humans in Hong Kong and two in France, and from one fish in Thailand. We hypothesised that ST283 was causing region-wide infection in Southeast Asia.
   Methodology/Principal findings We performed a literature review, whole genome sequencing on 145 GBS isolates collected from six Southeast Asian countries, and phylogenetic analysis on 7,468 GBS sequences including 227 variants of ST283 from humans and animals. Although almost absent outside Asia, ST283 was found in all invasive Asian collections analysed, from 1995 to 2017. It accounted for 29/38 (76%) human isolates in Lao PDR, 102/139 (73%) in Thailand, 4/13 (31%) in Vietnam, and 167/739 (23%) in Singapore. ST283 and its variants were found in 62/62 (100%) tilapia from 14 outbreak sites in Malaysia and Vietnam, in seven fish species in Singapore markets, and a diseased frog in China.
   Conclusions GBS ST283 is widespread in Southeast Asia, where it accounts for a large proportion of bacteraemic GBS, and causes disease and economic loss in aquaculture. If human ST283 is fishborne, as in the Singapore outbreak, then GBS sepsis in Thailand and Lao PDR is predominantly a foodborne disease. However, whether transmission is from aquaculture to humans, or vice versa, or involves an unidentified reservoir remains unknown. Creation of cross-border collaborations in human and animal health are needed to complete the epidemiological picture.
   Author summary An outbreak due to a bacterium called Streptococccus agalactiae in Singapore in 2015 was caused by a clone called ST283, and was associated with consumption of raw freshwater-fish. It was considered unique as it was the only reported foodborne outbreak of this bacterium. Our new data show that invasive ST283 disease is far from unique. ST283 has been causing disease in humans and farmed fish in SE Asian countries for decades. Reports of ST283 are almost absent outside Asia. We suspect that human ST283 is fishborne in other Asian countries, as it was in Singapore, but we haven't looked at this yet. We don't know where ST283 originally came from; it may have been transmitted from humans to fish, or come from another animal. More studies are needed to determine ST283's geographical extent and burden of disease, as well as its origin, how it is transmitted, and what enables it to be so aggressive. We may then be able to interrupt transmission, to the benefit of fish, farmers, and the general public.

AB Background
   Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) serovars S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis are major etiologic agents of invasive bacterial disease among infants and young children in sub-Saharan Africa, including in Mali. Early studies of iNTS serovars in several countries indicated that S. Typhimurium was more prevalent than S. Enteritidis, including in Mali before 2008. We investigated genomic and associated phenotypic changes associated with an increase in the relative proportion of iNTS caused by S. Enteritidis versus S. Typhimurium in Bamako, Mali, during the period 2002-2012.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   Comparative genomics studies identified homologs of tetracycline resistance and arsenic utilization genes that were associated with the temporal shift of serovars causing iNTS shift, along with several hypothetical proteins. These findings, validated through PCR screening and phenotypic assays, provide initial steps towards characterizing the genomic changes consequent to unknown evolutionary pressures associated with the shift in serovar prevalence.
   Conclusions/Significance
   This work identified a shift to S. Enteritidis from the more classic S. Typhimurium, associated with iNTS in Bamako, Mali, during the period 2002-2012. This type of shift in underlying iNTS pathogens are of great importance to pediatric public health in endemic regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, this work demonstrates the utility of combining epidemiologic data, whole genome sequencing, and functional characterization in the laboratory to identify and characterize genomic changes in the isolates that may be involved with the observed shift in circulating iNTS agents.

TI Asymptomatic immune responders to Leishmania among HIV positive patients
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID VISCERAL LEISHMANIASIS; INFECTION; COINFECTION; DIAGNOSIS; RESPONSES;
   AIDS
AB Concomitant infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the Leishmania parasite is a growing public health problem, the result of the former spreading to areas where the latter is endemic. Leishmania infection is usually asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals, but the proportion of HIV+ individuals in contact with the parasite who remain asymptomatic is not known. The aim of the present work was to examine the use of cytokine release assays in the detection of asymptomatic immune responders to Leishmania among HIV+ patients with no previous leishmaniasis or current symptomatology. Eighty two HIV+ patients (all from Fuenlabrada, Madrid, Spain, where a leishmaniasis outbreak occurred in 2009) were examined for Leishmania infantum infection using molecular and humoral response-based methods. None returned a positive molecular or serological result for the parasite. Thirteen subjects showed a positive lymphoproliferative response to soluble Leishmania antigen (SLA), although the mean CD4+ T lymphocyte counts of these patients was below the normal range. Stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or whole blood with SLA (the lymphoproliferative assay and whole blood assay respectively), led to the production of specific cytokines and chemokines. Thus, despite being immunocompromised, HIV+ patients can maintain a Th1-type cellular response to Leishmania. In addition, cytokine release assays would appear to be useful tools for detecting these individuals via the identification of IFN-gamma in the supernatants of SLA-stimulated PBMC, and of IFN-gamma, MIG and IL-2 in SLA-stimulated whole blood. These biomarkers appear to be 100% reliable for detecting asymptomatic immune responders to Leishmania among HIV+ patients.
   Author summary The proportion of patients with HIV+ who have at some time been infected with the Leishmania parasite, but who remain asymptomatic, is unknown. It is important to be able to identify such patients to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic leishmaniasis in the HIV+ population, and because these persons are at increased risk of developing symptomatic visceral leishmaniasis. In the present work, a population of HIV+ patients showing a cellular immune response to Leishmania infantum was identified. These subjects all showed a clear Th1-type response when their PBMC or blood were stimulated in vitro with soluble Leishmania antigen (SLA). Cytokine release assays and the detection of IFN-gamma, MIG and IL-2 (specific biomarkers for immunity to Leishmania) were found to be useful for detecting this population of HIV+ patients. New studies with larger numbers of patients are needed to confirm the present results.

TI Failure of the dog culling strategy in controlling human visceral

ID CANINE LEISHMANIASIS; MINAS-GERAIS; INSECTICIDE; INFECTION; STATE; AREAS
AB In the present study, we assessed the annual screening coverage (i.e., the percentage of dogs that are screened for anti-Leishmania antibodies annually) in the municipality of Sobral, Ceara state, Brazil. Data on the number of dogs screened during 2008-2017 (except 2010) were obtained from the Centre for Zoonoses Control of Sobral. The annual screening coverage during 2012-2017 was calculated. Data on human visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases during 2008-2017 were compiled from the National Disease Notification System. Correlation analyses were performed to assess the correlation between canine and human data. During 2008-2017, 73,964 dogs (range, 0 to 13,980 dogs/year) were serologically screened and 2,833 (3.8%) were positive. The annual screening coverage during 2012-2017 ranged from 11.1% to 45.7%. There were no significant correlations between the number of dogs culled and the number of human VL cases, canine positivity and human VL incidence, number of dogs culled and human VL incidence, or between canine positivity and number of human VL cases. An inconsistent and relatively low annual screening coverage was found in the study area, with no dog being screened in 2010 due to the lack of serological tests. Our results highlight that many dogs potentially infected with Leishmania infantum have been virtually overlooked by public health workers in the study area, perhaps with a negative, yet underestimated, impact on the control of canine and human VL. Hence, the failure of the dog culling strategy in controlling human VL in Brazil may be due to the low screening coverage and low percentage of culled dogs, rather than the absence of associations between canine and human infections.
   Author summary The euthanasia of Leishmania-seropositive dogs has been recommended for controlling human visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in some countries where this zoonosis is endemic. We assessed the annual screening coverage (i.e., the percentage of dogs living in a given area that are screened for anti-Leishmania antibodies annually) in the municipality of Sobral, Ceara state, one of the main foci of human VL in Brazil. From 2008 to 2017, nearly 74,000 dogs were screened and 3.8% of them were positive for anti-Leishmania antibodies. No statistically significant correlation was found between the number of dogs culled annually and the incidence of human VL. The annual screening coverage ranged from 11.1% to 45.7%. Our results highlight an inconsistent and relatively low annual screening coverage, indicating that dogs potentially infected with L. infantum have been virtually overlooked by public health workers in the study area.

AB As emerging and re-emerging infectious arboviruses like dengue, chikungunya, and Zika threaten new populations worldwide, officials scramble to assess local severity and transmissibility, with little to no epidemiological history to draw upon. Indirect estimates of risk from vector habitat suitability maps are prone to great uncertainty, while direct estimates from epidemiological data are only possible after cases accumulate and, given environmental constraints on arbovirus transmission, cannot be widely generalized beyond the focal region. Combining these complementary methods, we use disease importation and transmission data to improve the accuracy and precision of a priori ecological risk estimates. We demonstrate this approach by estimating the spatiotemporal risks of Zika virus transmission throughout Texas, a high-risk region in the southern United States. Our estimates are, on average, 80% lower than published ecological estimates-with only six of 254 Texas counties deemed capable of sustaining a Zika epidemic-and they are consistent with the number of autochthonous cases detected in 2017. Importantly our method provides a framework for model comparison, as our mechanistic understanding of arbovirus transmission continues to improve. Real-time updating of prior risk estimates as importations and outbreaks arise can thereby provide critical, early insight into local transmission risks as emerging arboviruses expand their global reach.
   Author summary When novel infectious diseases like chikungunya or Zika emerge and threaten global spread, public health officials worldwide must assess the risk for local introductions and outbreaks. These assessments are made in anticipation of local case data, and officials must draw upon historic evidence from similar diseases or locations. Thus, accurate local risk assessments have most often been limited to retrospective analyses and have been unavailable in real-time during an emerging epidemic. Here we present a method that can harness both historic and current data to produce early risk assessments and update projections in real-time. We demonstrate our approach by estimating local transmission risk for Zika throughout the state of Texas. Our findings suggest that the majority of Texas counties face little risk for sustaining a Zika epidemic, and successfully predict the number of locally transmitted cases across the state. Real-time updating of local transmission risk estimates during an emerging epidemic can thus provide actionable, early insight for public health response as emerging arboviruses expand their global reach.

TI "It's just a fever": Gender based barriers to care-seeking for visceral
   leishmaniasis in highly endemic districts of India: A qualitative study
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID CONSEQUENCES; DISEASE; ACCESS; BIHAR; POOR
AB Introduction Diagnosis and treatment for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is considered to be delayed amongst poor, rural women in highly endemic districts of Bihar and Jharkhand. The objective of this study was to assess and understand barriers to VL diagnosis and treatment for women in endemic districts with a high burden of VL.
   Methods The study used a stratified and purposive sample of 33 female patients with VL, 11 health staff, 11 local (unqualified) health providers and 12 groups of community elders drawn from ten districts in Bihar and four in Jharkhand with high burdens of VL. The study was conducted within an exploratory and inductive framework, using semi-structured in-depth interviews and discussions.
   Results Women accessing treatment more quickly tended to move faster from treating their symptoms on their own to seeking care from local providers. Perception among female patients of the illness being not serious (owing to initially non-specific and mild symptoms), lack of money, prioritisation of household chores over their need to seek care and the absence of a male guardian to accompany them in seeking care at facilities worked together to drive these choices. Most patients and their families did not suspect VL as the cause for their non-specific symptoms, but when VL was suspected, treatment shopping ended. Lack of prioritization of women's health issues appears to be a pervasive underlying factor. Public health facilities were not an early treatment choice for the majority, but where it was, the diagnosis of VL was often not considered when presenting with under 2 weeks of symptoms, nor were appropriate follow-up plans instituted.
   Conclusion The insidious presentation of VL and the low prioritisation of women's health need to be jointly addressed through messages that emphasise the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of disease, which is low-cost in time and money when managed in public health facilities. Clear messages that project prioritising women's care-seeking over household work as a smart choice and the need for rallying male support are needed. Additionally, efforts to reduce missed opportunities through early case suspicion and engaging private providers to better counsel women with suspected VL could close critical gaps in the continuum of care.
   Author summary India bears the greatest burden of a fatal parasitic disease called visceral leishmaniasis (VL), popularly known as Kala Azar. The disease is confined mostly to hot spots in Bihar and Jharkhand in the eastern part of the country. Amongst factors hampering efforts to eliminate VL are delays from the onset of symptoms to the time patients are diagnosed and treated, where disease transmission is thought to be greatest and longer delays result in poorer outcomes; this is considered to be a particular problem in poorer women living in rural areas. This study found patterns in careseeking: initial self-medication followed by multiple visits to local (unqualified) providers and visits to private facilities, before ultimately reaching the public health facilities where treatment was freely available. Those who did attend public health facilities early in their illness were not tested for VL nor followed up with a possible diagnosis of VL in mind. Female patients tended to under-estimate the severity of their illness, while social and economic reasons also influenced care-seeking behaviour-particularly the lack of a male relative in the house, and a reluctance to utilise already meagre resources. The conclusions of the study were the need to encourage women with persistent fever to seek care without delay, while ensuring that factors that serve as barriers, such as low prioritisation of women's health by households (and the women themselves) is countered by messages emphasizing the danger of delayed treatment for VL and the low time-cost burden of availing care within the public health sector. Improving awareness of VL amongst informal and formal health providers remains key in this process.

TI Towards harmonisation of entomological surveillance in the Mediterranean

AB Background
   The Mediterranean Basin is historically a hotspot for trade, transport, and migration. As a result, countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea share common public health threats. Among them are vector-borne diseases, and in particular, mosquito-borne viral diseases are prime candidates as (re)emerging diseases and are likely to spread across the area. Improving preparedness and response capacities to these threats at the regional level is therefore a major issue.
   The implementation of entomological surveillance is, in particular, of utmost importance. Guidance in designing entomological surveillance systems is critical, and these systems may pursue different specific objectives depending on the disease.
   The purpose of the proposed review is to draw up guidelines for designing effective and sustainable entomological surveillance systems in order to improve preparedness and response. However, we make it clear that there is no universal surveillance system, so the thinking behind harmonisation is to define evidence-based standards in order to promote best practises, identify the most appropriate surveillance activities, and optimise the use of resources.
   Such guidance is aimed at policymakers and diverse stakeholders and is intended to be used as a framework for the implementation of entomological surveillance programmes. It will also be useful to collaborate and share information with health professionals involved in other areas of disease surveillance. Medical entomologists and vector control professionals will be able to refer to this report to advocate for tailored entomological surveillance strategies.
   The main threats targeted in this review are the vectors of dengue virus, chikungunya virus, Zika virus, West Nile virus, and Rift Valley fever virus. The vectors of all these arboviruses are mosquitoes.
   Methods
   Current knowledge on vector surveillance in the Mediterranean area is reviewed. The analysis was carried out by a collaboration of the medical entomology experts in the region, all of whom belong to the MediLabSecure network, which is currently funded by the European Union and represents an international effort encompassing 19 countries in the Mediterranean and Black Sea region.
   Findings
   Robust surveillance systems are required to address the globalisation of emerging arboviruses. The prevention and management of mosquito-borne viral diseases must be addressed in the prism of a One Health strategy that includes entomological surveillance as an integral part of the policy. Entomological surveillance systems should be designed according to the entomological and epidemiological context and must have well-defined objectives in order to effect a tailored and graduated response. We therefore rely on different scenarios according to different entomological and epidemiological contexts and set out detailed objectives of surveillance. The development of multidisciplinary networks involving both academics and public authorities will provide resources to address these health challenges by promoting good practises in surveillance (identification of surveillance aims, design of surveillance systems, data collection, dissemination of surveillance results, evaluation of surveillance activities) and through the sharing of effective knowledge and information. These networks will also contribute to capacity building and stronger collaborations between sectors at both the local and regional levels. Finally, concrete guidance is offered on the vector of the main arbovirus based on the current situation in the area.

AB The expansion of urban ecosystems and climate change, both outcomes of massive lifestyle changes, contribute to a series of side effects such as environmental deterioration, spread of diseases, increased greenhouse gas emissions and introduction of invasive species. In the case of the Athens metropolitan area, an invasive mosquito species-the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus)-has spread widely in the last decade. This spread is favoured within urban environments and is also affected by changing climatic trends. The Asian tiger mosquito is accompanied by risks of mosquito-borne diseases, greater nuisance levels, and increased expenses incurring for its confrontation. The main aims of this paper are (i) to estimate the various costs associated with the control of this invasive species, as well as its health and nuisance impacts, (ii) to evaluate the level of citizens' well-being from averting these impacts and (iii) to record citizens' and experts' perceptions regarding alternative control measures. Evidence shows that experts tend to place a high value on mosquito control when associated with serious health risks, while citizens are more sensitive and concerned about the environmental impacts of control methods. The synthesis of results produced by the current study could act as a preliminary guide for the estimation of societal welfare from the confrontation of similar problems in the context of a complex ecosystem.
   Author summary This paper is based on several years' collaboration among researchers from various disciplines, key health policy makers and stakeholders in an attempt to evaluate the economic dimensions related to the presence of the Asian Tiger Mosquito (Aedes albopictus) and the challenges of tackling mosquito-borne disease outbreaks in Greece and Southern Europe. Similar studies have been conducted and continue to be published in Europe and the USA examining the socioeconomic benefit from the implementation of relevant control and prevention strategies. These studies conclude that there are significant benefits related both to the reduction of nuisance levels and the reduction of the health risks posed by various mosquito species. In our case, the application of an updated economic analysis on the effectiveness of relevant public control and prevention programs provides essential information for public health decision-making, bearing in mind the significant restructuring of the public sector and the fiscal crisis apparent in the European South.

AB Mass drug administration (MDA) is, and has been, the principal method for the control of the schistosome helminths. Using MDA only is unlikely to eliminate the infection in areas of high transmission and the implementation of other measures such as reduced water contact improved hygiene and sanitation are required. Ideally a vaccine is needed to ensure long term benefits and eliminate the need for repeated drug treatment since infection does not seem to induce lasting protective immunity. Currently, a candidate vaccine is under trial in a baboon animal model, and very encouraging results have been reported. In this paper, we develop an individual-based stochastic model to evaluate the effect of a vaccine with similar properties in humans to those recorded in baboons in achieving the World Health Organization (WHO) goals of morbidity control and elimination as a public health problem in populations living in a variety of transmission settings. MDA and vaccination assuming different durations of protection and coverage levels, alone or in combination, are examined as treatment strategies to reach the WHO goals of the elimination of morbidity and mortality in the coming decade. We find that the efficacy of a vaccine as an adjunct or main control tool will depend critically on a number of factors including the average duration of protection it provides, vaccine efficacy and the baseline prevalence prior to immunization. In low prevalence settings, simulations suggest that the WHO goals can be achieved for all treatment strategies. In moderate prevalence settings, a vaccine that provides 5 years of protection, can achieve both goals within 15 years of treatment. In high prevalence settings, by vaccinating at age 1, 6 and 11 we can achieve the morbidity control with a probability of nearly 0.89 but we cannot achieve elimination as a public health problem goal. A combined vaccination and MDA treatment plan has the greatest chance of achieving the WHO goals in the shorter term.
   Author summary Nearly 258 million people are infected worldwide by schistosome parasites. The World Health Organization (WHO) has set control guidelines to combat the morbidity and mortality induced by infection, defined by reaching <= 5% and <= 1% prevalence of heavy-intensity infections in school-aged children (SAC), respectively. Mass drug administration (MDA) is the major route for morbidity control and elimination. However, MDA does not provide long-term protection against schistosome parasites and frequent drug administration is therefore required to control morbidity. Infection does not induce lasting acquired immunity to reinfection. Drug resistance is another issue with MDA which, if it arises, could possibly make drug treatment ineffective over time as drug-resistant genes in the parasite population increase in frequency. A vaccine is ideally needed to both reduce the possibility of reinfection and to achieve transmission elimination within a feasible time frame. Based on the recent results obtained for a new candidate vaccine in the baboon animal model, we employ an individual-based stochastic model to assess the impact of a vaccine with an efficacy of 100% when applied in endemic regions with different intensities of transmission. Simulations suggest that the probability of achieving morbidity control and elimination as a public health problem depends on the duration of protection provided by vaccination, the age categories of the human host population vaccinated, and the coverage levels achieved. In order to achieve elimination as a public health problem, model simulations suggest that combining vaccination (with 5 years of protection) with MDA (treating 75% of school-aged children, 5-14 years of age) is the best option, particularly in high transmission settings.

AB Background The Alliance for the Global Elimination of Trachoma has set the target for eliminating trachoma as a public health problem by 2020. However, challenges remain, including socio-cultural issues. Districts in Northern Tanzania, predominantly inhabited by the Maasai ethnic group, remain endemic for trachoma. We explored socio-cultural factors that may impact the elimination of trachoma.
   Methods/Findings This study was nested within a larger ethnographic study of trachoma among Maasai in Northern Tanzania. We used stratified random sampling and semi-structured interviews to examine knowledge and understanding. Interviews were conducted and recorded in Maa, by a native Maa speaking trained interviewer. Transcripts were translated into English. A framework method for a content analysis was used. There was awareness of trachoma and basic symptoms. Yet understanding of etiology and prevention was poor. Trachoma was attributed to pollen, dust, and smoke. Water was recognized as beneficial, but seen as treatment and not prevention. Traditional medicines were most often used for treating conjunctival inflammation, with the most common being a rough leaf used to scratch the inside of the eyelid until it bleeds. Knowledge of mass drug administration (MDA) was inconsistent, although many thought it helped the community, but it was perceived as only for children and the sick. Many participants reported not taking azithromycin and some had no recollection of MDA six months earlier. There was little connection between childhood infection, trichiasis and related blindness. Trichiasis was often seen as a problem of old women, and treated locally by epilation.
   Conclusion/Significance Understanding indigenous knowledge may help guide control programs, tailor them to local contexts, address local beliefs and dispel misunderstandings. There is an essential need to understand the social, cultural and political context of the target community to deliver effective programs. Despite limited knowledge, the community recognized trachoma as a public health problem. Results have implications for disease control programs in other marginalized communities.
   Author summary While global efforts to control and ultimately eliminate trachoma have been successful in many contexts, it has proven to be more challenging in many societies. Due to social, political or economic vulnerabilities, the approach to delivering global health programmes to some marginalized communities requires a more social science perspective. The Maasai, semi-nomadic pastoralists predominantly spanning the central border of Tanzania and Kenya, are one such community in which trachoma is endemic despite efforts to deliver interventions. Trachoma control interventions require community understanding of trachoma and behavior change. Furthermore, it is important to consider the community's perspective to account for socio-cultural factors that may guide the design of effective control programmes and increase uptake of the interventions. This paper explores the knowledge and understanding of the nature of trachoma including pathology, progression of disease, risk factors, prevention and treatment among a trachoma endemic Maasai community. These findings can help guide more effective public health approaches to implementation of trachoma and other disease control interventions in Maasai communities.

AB Background African trypanosomosis, primarily transmitted by tsetse flies, remains a serious public health and economic challenge in sub-Saharan Africa. Interventions employing natural repellents from non-preferred hosts of tsetse flies represent a promising management approach. Although zebras have been identified as non-preferred hosts of tsetse flies, the basis for this repellency is poorly understood. We hypothesized that zebra skin odors contribute to their avoidance by tsetse flies.
   Methodology/Principal findings We evaluated the effect of crude zebra skin odors on catches of wild savannah tsetse flies (Glossina pallidipes Austen, 1903) using unbaited Ngu traps compared to the traps baited with two known tsetse fly management chemicals; a repellent blend derived from waterbuck odor, WRC (comprising geranylacetone, guaiacol, pentanoic acid and delta-octalactone), and an attractant comprising cow urine and acetone, in a series of Latin square-designed experiments. Coupled gas chromatography-electroantennographic detection (GC/EAD) and GC-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analyses of zebra skin odors identified seven electrophysiologically-active components; 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, acetophenone, geranylacetone, heptanal, octanal, nonanal and decanal, which were tested in blends and singly for repellency to tsetse flies when combined with Ngu traps baited with cow urine and acetone in field trials. The crude zebra skin odors and a seven-component blend of the EAD-active components, formulated in their natural ratio of occurrence in zebra skin odor, significantly reduced catches of G. pallidipesby 66.7% and 48.9% respectively, and compared favorably with the repellency of WRC (58.1%- 59.2%). Repellency of the seven-component blend was attributed to the presence of the three ketones 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, acetophenone and geranylacetone, which when in a blend caused a 62.7% reduction in trap catch of G. pallidipes.
   Conclusions/Significance Our findings reveal fundamental insights into tsetse fly ecology and the allomonal effect of zebra skin odor, and potential integration of the three-component ketone blend into the management toolkit for tsetse and African trypanosomosis control.
   Author summary The use of repellents from non-preferred hosts represents an innovative approach to control animal African trypanosomosis by limiting contact between tsetse flies and livestock. Although zebras are non-preferred hosts, the possible chemical basis of their avoidance by tsetse flies is unknown. We hypothesized that certain chemical components of zebra skin odor play a role in their avoidance. We tested this hypothesis by screening crude zebra skin odor for repellency, identifying the chemicals detected by tsetse flies (G. pallidipes) in the skin odor matrix of zebra, and establishing the specific chemicals eliciting repellency in field trials. We identified a three-component blend as contributing to the repellency of the crude zebra skin odor. Repellency of the crude zebra skin odor and the three-component repellent blend was comparable to the known tsetse repellent, WRC (waterbuck repellent compounds), derived from waterbuck skin odor. Our study shows that odors play a role in the avoidance behavior of tsetse flies to zebras. The three-component repellent blend identified in zebra skin odor provides a new effective tool in the management of tsetse flies and trypanosomosis.

AB The 2018 outbreak of Nipah virus in Kerala, India, highlights the need for global surveillance of henipaviruses in bats, which are the reservoir hosts for this and other viruses. Nipah virus, an emerging paramyxovirus in the genus Henipavirus, causes severe disease and stuttering chains of transmission in humans and is considered a potential pandemic threat. In May 2018, an outbreak of Nipah virus began in Kerala, > 1800 km from the sites of previous outbreaks in eastern India in 2001 and 2007. Twenty-three people were infected and 21 people died (16 deaths and 18 cases were laboratory confirmed). Initial surveillance focused on insectivorous bats (Megaderma spasma), whereas follow-up surveys within Kerala found evidence of Nipah virus in fruit bats (Pteropus medius). P. medius is the confirmed host in Bangladesh and is now a confirmed host in India. However, other bat species may also serve as reservoir hosts of henipaviruses. To inform surveillance of Nipah virus in bats, we reviewed and analyzed the published records of Nipah virus surveillance globally. We applied a trait-based machine learning approach to a subset of species that occur in Asia, Australia, and Oceana. In addition to seven species in Kerala that were previously identified as Nipah virus seropositive, we identified at least four bat species that, on the basis of trait similarity with known Nipah virus-seropositive species, have a relatively high likelihood of exposure to Nipah or Nipah-like viruses in India. These machine-learning approaches provide the first step in the sequence of studies required to assess the risk of Nipah virus spillover in India. Nipah virus surveillance not only within Kerala but also elsewhere in India would benefit from a research pipeline that included surveys of known and predicted reservoirs for serological evidence of past infection with Nipah virus (or cross reacting henipaviruses). Serosurveys should then be followed by longitudinal spatial and temporal studies to detect shedding and isolate virus from species with evidence of infection. Ecological studies will then be required to understand the dynamics governing prevalence and shedding in bats and the contacts that could pose a risk to public health.
   Author summary Nipah virus is an emerging zoonotic virus that spills over from bats to humans causing severe disease and chains of transmission in humans. In May 2018, in Kerala, India, Nipah virus infected 23 people, killing 21. We reviewed and analyzed published records of Nipah virus surveillance in bats and identified eleven species that occur in India and have had evidence of henipavirus infection or exposure. However, almost all of these bat species were sampled outside of India. Using a trait-based machine learning approach, we identified at least four additional Indian bat species that are likely to have been exposed to Nipah virus or cross-reacting henipaviruses. We suggest surveillance of these species as well as studies on the ecological dynamics of Nipah virus and epidemiology of spillover transmission to humans. This work will help prioritize a research agenda for responding to the recent outbreak of Nipah virus in Kerala, India and elsewhere.

TI Reviewing evidence of the clinical effectiveness of commercially

   multi-centre, multi-antivenom clinical trial
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Review
ID SNAKE BITES; F(AB')(2); TOLERANCE
AB Background Snakebite envenoming kills more than more than 20,000 people in Sub-Saharan Africa every year. Poorly regulated markets have been inundated with low-price, low-quality antivenoms. This review aimed to systematically collect and analyse the clinical data on all antivenom products now available in markets of sub-Saharan Africa.
   Methodology/Principal findings Our market analysis identified 12 polyspecific and 4 monospecific antivenom products in African markets. Our search strategy was first based on a systematic search of publication databases, followed by manual searches and discussions with experts. All types of data, including programmatic data, were eligible. All types of publications were eligible, including grey literature. Cohorts of less than 10 patients were excluded. 26 publications met the inclusion criteria. Many publications had to be excluded because clinical outcomes were not clearly linked to a specific product. Our narrative summaries present product-specific clinical data in terms of safety and effectiveness against the different species and envenoming syndromes. Three products (EchiTabPlus, EchiTabG, SAIMR-Echis-monovalent) were found to have been tested in robust clinical studies and found effective against envenoming caused by the West African carpet viper (Echis ocellatus). Four products (Inoserp-Panafricain, Fav-Afrique, SAIMR-Polyvalent, Antivipmyn-Africa) were found to have been evaluated only in observational single-arm studies, with varying results. For nine other products, there are either no data in the public domain, or only negative data suggesting a lack of effectiveness.
   Conclusions/Significance Clinical data vary among the different antivenom products currently in African markets. Some products are available commercially although they have been found to lack effectiveness. The World Health Organization should strengthen its capacity to assess antivenom products, support antivenom manufacturers, and assist African countries and international aid organizations in selecting appropriate quality antivenoms.
   Author summary Snakebite envenomation represents one of the most neglected tropical medical conditions worldwide. Despite high levels of morbidity and mortality associated with snakebite, its neglected nature has compromised the availability and evaluation of antivenom treatment. This review was initiated by Medecins Sans Frontieres' / Doctors Without Borders (MSF) Access Campaign, as the existing antivenom access crisis in sub-Saharan Africa was deepening. This study sought to review the clinical data pertaining to each antivenom product currently available for use in sub-Saharan Africa. 16 different antivenoms were identified. A total of 26 studies met the inclusion criteria. Given the heterogeneity of study methodology and quality, data for individual antivenoms are presented in the form of a narrative analysis. Only two studies reported clinical data collected from randomized controlled trials. Consistent monitoring of the side effects of antivenom treatment was lacking. The absence of good quality data for the majority of antivenoms in sub-Saharan Africa is a major concern. Further robust data collection is required, while urgent investments are needed at the global level to ensure a sustained production of safe and effective antivenom treatment, and its affordable access across sub-Saharan Africa.

AB Background Trypanosoma cruzi, the protozoan causative of Chagas disease, is classified into six main Discrete Typing Units (DTUs): TcI-TcVI. This parasite has around 10(5) copies of the minicircle hypervariable region (mHVR) in their kinetoplastic DNA (kDNA). The genetic diversity of the mHVR is virtually unknown. However, cross-hybridization assays using mHVRs showed hybridization only between isolates belonging to the same genetic group. Nowadays there is no methodologic approach with a good sensibility, specificity and reproducibility for direct typing on biological samples. Due to its high copy number and apparently high diversity, mHVR becomes a good target for typing.
   Methodology/Principal findings Around 22 million reads, obtained by amplicon sequencing of the mHVR, were analyzed for nine strains belonging to six T. cruzi DTUs. The number and diversity of mHVR clusters was variable among DTUs and even within a DTU. However, strains of the same DTU shared more mHVR clusters than strains of different DTUs and clustered together. In addition, hybrid DTUs (TcV and TcVI) shared similar percentages (1.9-3.4%) of mHVR clusters with their parentals (TcII and TcIII). Conversely, just 0.2% of clusters were shared between TcII and TcIII suggesting biparental inheritance of the kDNA in hybrids. Sequencing at low depth (20,000-40,000 reads) also revealed 95% of the mHVR clusters for each of the analyzed strains. Finally, the method revealed good correlation in cluster identity and abundance between different replications of the experiment (r = 0.999).
   Conclusions/Significance Our work sheds light on the sequence diversity of mHVRs at intra and inter-DTU level. The mHVR amplicon sequencing workflow described here is a reproducible technique, that allows multiplexed analysis of hundreds of strains and results promissory for direct typing on biological samples in a future. In addition, such approach may help to gain knowledge on the mechanisms of the minicircle evolution and phylogenetic relationships among strains.
   Author summary Chagas disease is an important public health problem in Latin America showing a wide diversity of clinical manifestations and epidemiological patterns. It is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. This parasite is genetically diverse and classified into six main lineages. However, the relationship between intra-specific genetic diversity and clinical or epidemiological features is not clear, mainly because low sensitivity for direct typing on biological samples. For this reason, genetic markers with high copy number are required to achieve sensitivity. Here, we deep sequenced and analyzed a DNA region present in the large mitochondria of the parasite (named as mHVR, 10(5) copies per parasite) from strains belonging to the six main lineages in order to analyze mHVR diversity and to evaluate its usefulness for typing. Despite the high sequence diversity, strains of the same lineage shared more sequences than strains of different lineages. Curiously, hybrid lineages shared mHVR sequences with both parents suggesting that mHVR (and DNA minicircles from the mitochondria) are inherited from both parentals. The mHVR amplicon sequencing workflow proposed here is reproducible and, potentially, it would be useful for typing hundreds of biological samples at time. It also provides a valuable approach to perform evolutionary and functional studies.

TI Seasonal and geographic variation in insecticide resistance in Aedes
   aegypti in southern Ecuador
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES

DT Article
ID DENGUE; MECHANISMS; IMPACT; ZIKA
AB Insecticide resistance (IR) can undermine efforts to control vectors of public health importance. Aedes aegypti is the main vector of resurging diseases in the Americas such as yellow fever and dengue, and recently emerging chikungunya and Zika fever, which have caused unprecedented epidemics in the region. Vector control remains the primary intervention to prevent outbreaks of Aedes-transmitted diseases. In many high-risk regions, like southern Ecuador, we have limited information on IR. In this study, Ae. aegypti IR was measured across four cities in southern Ecuador using phenotypic assays and genetic screening for alleles associated with pyrethroid IR. Bottle bioassays showed significant inter-seasonal variation in resistance to deltamethrin, a pyrethroid commonly used by the Ministry of Health, and alpha-cypermethrin, as well as between-city differences in deltamethrin resistance. There was also a significant difference in phenotypic response to the organophosphate, Malathion, between two cities during the second sampling season. Frequencies of the resistant V1016I genotype ranged from 0.13 to 0.68. Frequencies of the resistant F1534C genotype ranged from 0.63 to 1.0, with sampled populations in Machala and Huaquillas at fixation for the resistant genotype in all sampled seasons. In Machala and Portovelo, there were statistically significant inter-seasonal variation in genotype frequencies for V1016I. Resistance levels were highest in Machala, a city with hyperendemic dengue transmission and historically intense insecticide use. Despite evidence that resistance alleles conferred phenotypic resistance to pyrethroids, there was not a precise correspondence between these indicators. For the F1534C gene, 17.6% of homozygous mutant mosquitoes and 70.8% of heterozygotes were susceptible, while for the V1016I gene, 45.6% homozygous mutants and 55.6% of heterozygotes were susceptible. This study shows spatiotemporal variability in IR in Ae. aegypti populations in southern coastal Ecuador, and provides an initial examination of IR in this region, helping to guide vector control efforts for Ae. aegypti.
   Author summary Mosquito control is the primary method of managing the spread of many diseases transmitted by the yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti). Throughout much of Latin America the transmission of diseases like dengue fever and Zika fever pose a serious risk to public health. The rise of insecticide resistance (IR) is a major threat to established vector control programs, which may fail if commonly used insecticides are rendered ineffective. Public health authorities in southern coastal Ecuador, a high-risk region for diseases vectored by Ae. aegypti, previously had limited information on the status of IR in local populations of mosquitoes. Here, we present the first assessment of IR in adult Ae. aegypti to insecticides (deltamethrin, Malathion, and alpha-cypermethrin) routinely used in public health vector control in four cities along Ecuador's southern coast. Observed patterns of IR differed between cities and seasons of mosquito sampling, suggesting that IR status may fluctuate in space and time. The highest overall resistance was detected in Machala, a city with hyperendemic dengue transmission and a long history of intense insecticide use. Monitoring for IR is an integral component of vector control services, where alternative management strategies are deployed when IR is detected.

TI Prevalence of trachoma within refugee camps serving South Sudanese
   refugees in White Nile State, Sudan: Results from population-based
   surveys
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID EPIDEMIOLOGY; AZITHROMYCIN
AB Background The world is witnessing mass displacement of populations which could impact global efforts to eliminate neglected tropical diseases such as trachoma. On the African continent, South Sudan has experienced high levels of population displacement. Population based baseline trachoma surveys were conducted among refugee camps in two Sudanese localities hosting South Sudanese refugee populations to determine whether the SAFE strategy was warranted.
   Methodology/Principal findings Cross-sectional, multi-stage, cluster-random surveys were conducted within refugee camps in each of two Sudanese localities, Al Salam and Al Jabalain. For survey sampling, multiple camps within each locality were combined to form the sampling frame for that locality. Household water, sanitation and hygiene indicators were assessed, and trachoma signs were graded by trained and certified graders. The prevalence of trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF) in children aged one to nine years was 15.7% (95%CI: 12.1-20.2) in Al Salam and 10.6% (95%CI: 7.9-14.0) in Al Jabalain. The prevalence of trachomatous trichiasis (TT) in those 15 years above was 2.9% (95%CI: 1.8-4.8) in Al Salam and 5.0% (95%CI: 3.8-6.6) in Al Jabalain. The presence of water and sanitation was high in both survey units.
   Conclusion/ Significance Sudan has made progress in reducing the prevalence of trachoma within the country; however, the presence of over one million refugees from a neighboring trachoma hyper-endemic country could impact this progress. These surveys were the first step in addressing this important issue. The results demonstrate that at least three years of mass drug administration with azithromycin and tetracycline is needed in addition to the provision of TT surgical services. Additionally, it highlights that non-endemic or formerly endemic localities may have to adopt new strategies to provide services for refugee populations originating from hyper-endemic regions to ensure elimination of trachoma as a public health problem for all populations.
   Author summary Ministries of health in multiple countries have made progress in reducing the prevalence of trachoma, the leading cause of infectious blindness. With the increase in displaced populations throughout the world, the work of these national programs could be put at risk as formerly endemic or non-endemic districts now host large numbers of refugees from trachoma endemic regions. To properly respond, national programs must first assess the extent of the disease. We conducted baseline surveys in South Sudanese refugee camps located in two Sudanese localities to determine the prevalence of trachoma. These surveys showed that conducting prevalence surveys in refugee camp settings was possible. Trachoma was found to be present within the refugee camp population and programmatic interventions are required. The global community cannot expect to eliminate trachoma in the near future if displaced populations within countries and across country borders are not addressed.

AB HTLV-1/2 are transmitted sexually, by whole cell blood products and from mother-to-child (MTC), mainly through breastfeeding. HTLV-1/2 prevalence in pregnant women is high in Rio de Janeiro, however there were no local studies addressing the rate of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO) and MTC transmission. The aim was to study sociodemographic characteristics which may be associated to HTLV-1/2 infection and describe pregnancy outcomes and MTC transmission in HTLV-1/2-positive women. The cross-sectional study screened 1,628 pregnant women in of Rio de Janeiro (2012-2014) and found 12 asymptomatic carrier mothers (prevalence = 0.74%). Pregnancy outcome information was retrieved from medical records. Sociodemographic characteristics were similar between the positive and negative groups except for maternal age, which was higher in carrier mothers. The incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes was similar in infected and non-infected patients (p = 0.33), however there was a high rate of premature rupture of membranes (PROM) amid infected mothers (3/12). Multilevel logistic regression found that for each additional year of age, the chance of being HTLV-1/2-positive increased 11% and that having another sexually transmitted infection (STI) increased 9 times the chance of being infected. Carrier mothers had more antenatal visits (OR = 5.26). Among the children of HTLV-1/2-positive mothers there was one fetal death, one infant death and one loss of follow-up. After two years of follow-up there was one case of MTC transmission (1/9). The mother reported breastfeeding for one month only. Knowledge about factors associated to HTLV-1/2 infection, its impact on pregnancy outcomes and the MTC transmission rate is important to guide public health policies on antenatal screening and management.
   Author summary HTLV-1/2 are retroviruses transmitted by sex, blood products and from mother to child (MTC), mainly through breastfeeding. There is currently no vaccine, treatment or cure. Although it's mostly asymptomatic it can cause disabling and even lethal diseases in carriers. The prevalence of HTLV-1/2 in pregnant women at the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro is high (0.74%). Our aim was to study the sociodemographic characteristics which may be associated to HTLV-1/2 infection and describe pregnancy outcomes and MTC transmission in the infected population. Apart from being slightly older, there were no differences in the carrier mothers' sociodemographic profile. Pregnant women with sexually transmitted infections had a 9-fold chance of being HTLV-1/2 positive. Although adverse pregnancy outcomes were not increased, infected mothers had a high rate of ruptured membranes. Among the children of HTLV-1/2-positive mothers there was one fetal death, one infant death and one loss of follow-up. There was one case of MTC transmission (1/9), after one month of breastfeeding. Knowledge about factors associated to HTLV-1/2 infection, its impact on pregnancy, and the MTC transmission rate is important to guide further research and public health policies.

   PARASITES; DISEASE; BURDEN
AB Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) are a major cause of morbidity in tropical developing countries with a global infection prevalence of more than one billion people and disease burden of around 3.4 million disability adjusted life years. Infection prevalence directly correlates to inadequate sanitation, impoverished conditions and limited access to public health systems. Underestimation of infection prevalence using traditional microscopy-based diagnostic techniques is common, specifically in populations with access to benzimidazole mass treatment programs and a predominance of low intensity infections. In this study, we developed a multiplexed-tandem qPCR (MT-PCR) tool to identify and quantify STH eggs in stool samples. We have assessed this assay by measuring infection prevalence and intensity in field samples of two cohorts of participants from Timor-Leste and Cambodia, which were collected as part of earlier epidemiological studies. MT-PCR diagnostic parameters were compared to a previously published multiplexed qPCR for STH detection. The MT-PCR assay agreed strongly with qPCR data and showed a diagnostic specificity of 99.60-100.00% (sensitivity of 83.33-100.00%) compared to qPCR and kappa agreement exceeding 0.85 in all tests. In addition, the MT-PCR has the added advantage of distinguishing Ancylostoma spp. species, namely Ancylostoma duodenale and Ancylostoma ceylanicum. This semi-automated platform uses a standardized, manufactured reagent kit, shows excellent run-to-run consistency/repeatability and supports high-throughput detection and quantitation at a moderate cost.
   Author summary Soil-transmitted helminthiases are among the most prevalent and damaging neglected tropical diseases and have a significant global health impact. Accurate identification and quantitation of STH infection is a cornerstone of effective control. Direct observation and counting of eggs in faeces is the current gold-standard method for diagnosis of infection. This approach is time consuming and has poor sensitivity. As ongoing oral benzimidazole therapy across many endemic regions leads to a reduction in STH prevalence and intensity, these sensitivity limitations become an increasingly relevant issue, particularly with respect to monitoring treatment efficacy, identifying reductions in parasite transmission, and accurately quantifying infection burden in discrete populations in middle-income countries. PCR-based detection has long been proposed as an alternative approach to STH diagnosis and many protocols, including quantitative PCR-based methods, have been developed. However, these methods are largely bespoke and use non-standardized reagents that can greatly impact on the transferability and relative consistency of their performance. In the current study, we evaluate an automated, commercially-produced molecular diagnostic tool for validation of the major soil-transmitted helminths, including Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, Necator americanus, Ancylostoma duodenale and Ancylostoma ceylanicum, and evaluate its performance in comparison to an established multiplexed qPCR using faecal samples from endemic settings.

AB Sustainable dengue intervention requires the participation of communities. Therefore, understanding the health beliefs, knowledge and perceptions of dengue among the local people can help to design locally appropriate strategies for effective interventions. A combination of qualitative semi-structured in-depth interviews (SDIs) and quantitative household questionnaire surveys (HHSs) was used to investigate the beliefs, knowledge and perceptions of dengue among the Shan people in Eastern Shan Special Region IV (ESSR4), Myanmar. The SDI was administered to 18 key informants, and the HHS was administered to 259 respondents. Only 14.7% (95% CI: 10.6-19.6%) of the HHS respondents could confirm that mosquitoes transmit dengue; 14.3% (95% CI: 10.3-19.1%) knew that piebald or Aedes mosquitoes transmit dengue; and 24.3% (95% CI: 19.2-30.0%) believed that dengue-transmitting mosquitoes mainly lived in small ponds. Merely ten (0.4%) of the 259 respondents of the HHS thought that dengue-transmitting mosquitoes bite in the day time. The people in the villages where there were outbreaks of dengue had more knowledge about dengue. This study demonstrates that the health beliefs of the Shan people were closely associated with their lifestyles, social and natural environments. To stay healthy, the Shan people clean their houses and surroundings regularly. However, their knowledge about dengue was not adequate for effective dengue control because it was mostly learned from previous dengue experiences and in a context that lacks systematic health education. Thus, in this setting, with a weak public health structure, more international support should be provided to promote the knowledge of the Shan people about dengue and to increase their sensitive awareness to dengue, which might be beneficial for social mobilization and community participation during future dengue prevention.
   Author summary The burden of dengue has been increasing over the last five decades, and dengue fever (DF) has become one of the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne diseases. DF has become another disease that threatens public health after malaria has become successfully controlled along the China-Myanmar border. However, it is currently not easy to contain epidemics of the dengue virus. As part of an integrated vector management approach, a community-based method is effective in the prevention of DF by tailoring the approach in a local context. Consequently, mixed methods comprising qualitative semi-structured in-depth interviews (SDIs) and quantitative household questionnaire surveys (HHSs) were used to study the health beliefs, knowledge and perceptions about dengue among the Shan people in Eastern Shan Special Region IV, Myanmar. This study found that the Shan people believed that their health was closely associated with their lifestyle and the social and physical environment in which they lived. Their beliefs originated from their primary social activities and cultural heritage. Most of their knowledge about DF was learned from previous outbreaks and interventions for the disease. The Shan people had a relatively higher level of knowledge about adult mosquito control, which they learned from previous malaria control programs, but they lacked knowledge on DF symptoms, transmission, vectors and Aedes larval breeding sites. Their knowledge about the methods of adult mosquito control could not effectively control DF. More sound health education is urgently needed to increase the local people's knowledge of dengue and to rouse community awareness and participation in cleaning vector breeding sites. In the context of a lack of the necessary technical and financial resources, these interventions might rely more on international aid and help from neighboring countries, such as China.

TI Genetic characteristics of pathogenic Leptospira in wild small animals

AB Background Leptospirosis is one of the most important neglected tropical bacterial diseases worldwide. However, there is limited information on the genetic diversity and host selectivity of pathogenic Leptospira in wild small mammal populations.
   Methodology/Principal findings Jiangxi Province, located in southern China, is a region highly endemic for leptospirosis. In this study, among a total of 3,531 trapped rodents dominated by Apodemus agrarius (59.7%), 330 Leptospira strains were successfully isolated from six different sites in Jiangxi between 2002 and 2015. Adding 71 local strains from humans, various kinds of livestock and wild animals in Jiangxi, a total of 401 epidemic strains were characterized using 16S rRNA gene senquencing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Among them, the most prevalent serogroup was Icterohaemorrhagiae (61.10%), followed by Javanica (19.20%) and Australis (9.73%); the remaining five serogroups, Canicola, Autumnalis, Grippotyphosa, Hebdomadis and Pomona, accounted for 9.97%. Species identification revealed that 325 were L. interrogans and 76 were L. borgpetersenii. Moreover, L. interrogans was the only pathogenic species in Fuliang and Shanggao and was predominant in Shangrao (95.0%); L. borgpetersenii was the most common in the remaining three sites. Twenty-one sequence types (STs) were identified. Similarly, ST1 and serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae were most prevalent in Shangrao (86.0% and 86.4%) and Fuliang (90.4% and 90.4%), ST143 and serogroup Javanica in Shangyou (88.5% and 90.4%) and Longnan (73.1% and 73.1%), and ST105 and serogroup Australis in Shanggao (46.3% and 56.1%). Serogroup Icterohaemorhagiae primarily linked to A. agrarius (86.9%), serogroup Canicola to dogs (83.3%). There were significant differences in the distribution of leptospiral species/serogroups/STs prevalence across host species/collected locations among the 394 animal-associated strains (Fisher's exact test, p<0.001).
   Conclusions/Significance Our study demonstrated high genetic diversity of pathogenic Leptospira strains from wild small animals in Jiangxi from 2002 to 2015. A. agrarius was the most abundantly trapped animal reservoir, and serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae and ST1 were the most dominant in Jiangxi. Significant geographic variation and host diversity in the distribution of dominant species, STs and serogroups were observed. Moreover, rat-to-human transmission might play a crucial role in the circulation of Leptospirosis in Jiangxi. Details of the serological and molecular characteristics circulating in this region will be essential in implementing prevention and intervention measures to reduce the risk of disease transmission in China. However, phylogenetic analysis of more Leptospira isolates should explore the impact of ecological change on leptospirosis transmission dynamics and investigate how such new knowledge might better impact environmental monitoring for disease control and prevention at a public health level.
   Author summary Leptospirosis, caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp, is one of the most widespread zoonoses. In recent years, human leptospirosis with occasionally fatal infections has been frequently reported in Jiangxi Province, a highly endemic region located in the south of China. However, there is a lack of information on circulating Leptospira strains in this province. To identify the etiological characteristics, 401 Leptospira from Jiangxi were characterized using serological and molecular typing methods. Serological typing revealed that 61.10% of the isolates belonged to serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae. Two species, L. interrogans and L. borgpetersenii, were identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A. agrarius may be the main carrier of leptospirosis in this endemic region. Furthermore, the diversity of leptospiral isolates was demonstrated using MLST analysis. ST1, as the most prevalent ST of pathogenic leptospires, was widely dispersed in China. Significant geographic variation and host diversity in the distribution of dominant species, serogroups and STs were found in Jiangxi. This study is the first to demonstrate the distribution of Leptospira in domestic and wildlife animals in Jiangxi. This retrospective study represents the longest and largest field epidemiological investigation on the etiological characteristics and genetic diversity of pathogenic Leptospira among large wild animal reservoirs and human populations in Jiangxi. A better understanding of the circulating etiological agents and epidemiology of leptospirosis will provide a good starting point for efforts to control and prevent this disease.

AB Infections with human herpesviruses are ubiquitous and a public health concern worldwide. Current treatments reduce the severity of some symptoms associated to herpetic infections but neither remove the viral reservoir from the infected host nor protect from the recurrent symptom outbreaks that characterise herpetic infections. The difficulty in therapeutically tackling these viral systems stems in part from their remarkably large proteomes and the complex networks of physical and functional associations that they tailor. This study presents our efforts to unravel the complexity of the interactome of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1), the prototypical herpesvirus species. Inspired by our previous work, we present an improved and more integrative computational pipeline for the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network reconstruction in HSV1, together with a newly developed consensus clustering framework, which allowed us to extend the analysis beyond binary physical interactions and revealed a system-level layout of higher-order functional associations in the virion proteome. Additionally, the analysis provided new functional annotation for the currently undercharacterised protein pUS10. In-depth bioinformatics sequence analysis unravelled structural features in pUS10 reminiscent of those observed in some capsid-associated proteins in tailed bacteriophages, with which herpesviruses are believed to share a common ancestry. Using immunoaffinity purification (IP)-mass spectrometry (MS), we obtained additional support for our bioinformatically predicted interaction between pUS10 and the inner tegument protein pUL37, which binds cytosolic capsids, contributing to initial tegumentation and eventually virion maturation. In summary, this study unveils new, to our knowledge, insights at both the system and molecular levels that can help us better understand the complexity behind herpesvirus infections.

AB Background
   Measures of the contribution of influenza to Streptococcus pneumoniae infections, both in the seasonal and pandemic setting, are needed to predict the burden of secondary bacterial infections in future pandemics to inform stockpiling. The magnitude of the interaction between these two pathogens has been difficult to quantify because both infections are mainly clinically diagnosed based on signs and symptoms; a combined viral-bacterial testing is rarely performed in routine clinical practice; and surveillance data suffer from confounding problems common to all ecological studies. We proposed a novel multivariate model for age-stratified disease incidence, incorporating contact patterns and estimating disease transmission within and across groups.
   Methods and findings
   We used surveillance data from England over the years 2009 to 2017. Influenza infections were identified through the virological testing of samples taken from patients diagnosed with influenza-like illness (ILI) within the sentinel scheme run by the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP). Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) cases were routinely reported to Public Health England (PHE) by all the microbiology laboratories included in the national surveillance system. IPD counts at week t, conditional on the previous time point t-1, were assumed to be negative binomially distributed. Influenza counts were linearly included in the model for the mean IPD counts along with an endemic component describing some seasonal background and an autoregressive component mimicking pneumococcal transmission. Using age-specific counts, Akaike information criterion (AIC)-based model selection suggested that the best fit was obtained when the endemic component was expressed as a function of observed temperature and rainfall. Pneumococcal transmission within the same age group was estimated to explain 33.0% (confidence interval [CI] 24.9%-39.9%) of new cases in the elderly, whereas 50.7% (CI 38.8%-63.2%) of incidence in adults aged 15-44 years was attributed to transmission from another age group. The contribution of influenza on IPD during the 2009 pandemic also appeared to vary greatly across subgroups, being highest in school-age children and adults (18.3%, CI 9.4%-28.2%, and 6.07%, CI 2.83%-9.76%, respectively). Other viral infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus, also seemed to have an impact on IPD: RSV contributed 1.87% (CI 0.89%-3.08%) to pneumococcal infections in the 65+ group, whereas 2.14% (CI 0.87%-3.57%) of cases in the group of 45- to 64-year-olds were attributed to rhinovirus. The validity of this modelling strategy relies on the assumption that viral surveillance adequately represents the true incidence of influenza in the population, whereas the small numbers of IPD cases observed in the younger age groups led to significant uncertainty around some parameter estimates.
   Conclusions
   Our estimates suggested that a pandemic wave of influenza A/H1N1 with comparable severity to the 2009 pandemic could have a modest impact on school-age children and adults in terms of IPD and a small to negligible impact on infants and the elderly. The seasonal impact of other viruses such as RSV and rhinovirus was instead more important in the older population groups.

AB Background
   Data are lacking from physical activity (PA) trials with long-term follow-up of both objectively measured PA levels and robust health outcomes. Two primary care 12-week pedometer-based walking interventions in adults and older adults (PACE-UP and PACE-Lift) found sustained objectively measured PA increases at 3 and 4 years, respectively. We aimed to evaluate trial intervention effects on long-term health outcomes relevant to walking interventions, using routine primary care data.
   Methods and findings
   Randomisation was from October 2012 to November 2013 for PACE-UP participants from seven general (family) practices and October 2011 to October 2012 for PACE-Lift participants from three practices. We downloaded primary care data, masked to intervention or control status, for 1,001 PACE-UP participants aged 45-75 years, 36% (361) male, and 296 PACE-Lift participants, aged 60-75 years, 46% (138) male, who gave written informed consent, for 4-year periods following randomisation. The following new events were counted for all participants, including those with preexisting diseases (apart from diabetes, for which existing cases were excluded): nonfatal cardiovascular, total cardiovascular (including fatal), incident diabetes, depression, fractures, and falls. Intervention effects on time to first event post-randomisation were modelled using Cox regression for all outcomes, except for falls, which used negative binomial regression to allow for multiple events, adjusting for age, sex, and study. Absolute risk reductions (ARRs) and numbers needed to treat (NNTs) were estimated. Data were downloaded for 1,297 (98%) of 1,321 trial participants. Event rates were low (<20 per group) for outcomes, apart from fractures and falls. Cox hazard ratios for time to first event post-randomisation for interventions versus controls were nonfatal cardiovascular 0.24 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07-0.77, p = 0.02), total cardiovascular 0.34 (95% CI 0.12-0.91, p = 0.03), diabetes 0.75 (95% CI 0.42-1.36, p = 0.34), depression 0.98 (95% CI 0.46-2.07, p = 0.96), and fractures 0.56 (95% CI 0.35-0.90, p = 0.02). Negative binomial incident rate ratio for falls was 1.07 (95% CI 0.78-1.46, p = 0.67). ARR and NNT for cardiovascular events were nonfatal 1.7% (95% CI 0.5%-2.1%), NNT = 59 (95% CI 48-194); total 1.6% (95% CI 0.2%-2.2%), NNT = 61 (95% CI 46-472); and for fractures 3.6% (95% CI 0.8%-5.4%), NNT = 28 (95% CI 19-125). Main limitations were that event rates were low and only events recorded in primary care records were counted; however, any underrecording would not have differed by intervention status and so should not have led to bias.
   Conclusions
   Routine primary care data used to assess long-term trial outcomes demonstrated significantly fewer new cardiovascular events and fractures in intervention participants at 4 years. No statistically significant differences between intervention and control groups were demonstrated for other events. Short-term primary care pedometer-based walking interventions can produce long-term health benefits and should be more widely used to help address the public health inactivity challenge.

TI The association between maternal body mass index and child obesity: A
   systematic review and meta-analysis

AB Background
   There is a global obesity crisis, particularly among women and disadvantaged populations. Early-life intervention to prevent childhood obesity is a priority for public health, global health, and clinical practice. Understanding the association between childhood obesity and maternal pre-pregnancy weight status would inform policy and practice by allowing one to estimate the potential for offspring health gain through channelling resources into intervention. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the dose-response association between maternal body mass index (BMI) and childhood obesity in the offspring.
   Methods and findings
   Searches in MEDLINE, Child Development & Adolescent Studies, CINAHL, Embase, and PsycInfo were carried out in August 2017 and updated in March 2019. Supplementary searches included hand-searching reference lists, performing citation searching, and contacting authors. Two researchers carried out independent screening, data extraction, and quality assessment. Observational studies published in English and reporting associations between continuous and/or categorical maternal and child BMI or z-score were included. Categorical outcomes were child obesity (>= 95th percentile, primary outcome), overweight/obesity (>= 85th percentile), and overweight (85th to 95th percentile). Linear and nonlinear dose-response meta-analyses were conducted using random effects models. Studies that could not be included in meta-analyses were summarised narratively. Seventy-nine of 41,301 studies identified met the inclusion criteria (n = 59 cohorts). Meta-analyses of child obesity included 20 studies (n = 88,872); child overweight/obesity, 22 studies (n = 181,800); and overweight, 10 studies (n = 53,238). Associations were nonlinear and there were significantly increased odds of child obesity with maternal obesity (odds ratio [OR] 3.64, 95% CI 2.68-4.95) and maternal overweight (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.62-2.19). Significantly increased odds were observed for child overweight/obesity (OR 2.69, 95% CI 2.10-3.46) and for child overweight (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.25, 2.59) with maternal obesity. A limitation of this research is that the included studies did not always report the data in a format that enabled inclusion in this complex meta-analysis.
   Conclusions
   This research has identified a 264% increase in the odds of child obesity when mothers have obesity before conception. This study provides substantial evidence for the need to develop interventions that commence prior to conception, to support women of childbearing age with weight management in order to halt intergenerational obesity.

TI Government policy interventions to reduce human antimicrobial use: A
   systematic review and evidence map

ID ANTIBIOTIC-PRESCRIBING PRACTICES; RESPIRATORY-TRACT INFECTIONS;
   PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE; RATIONAL USE; PUBLIC HOSPITALS; NATIONAL PROGRAM;
   IMPACT; RESISTANCE; STEWARDSHIP; CONSUMPTION
AB Background
   Growing political attention to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) offers a rare opportunity for achieving meaningful action. Many governments have developed national AMR action plans, but most have not yet implemented policy interventions to reduce antimicrobial overuse. A systematic evidence map can support governments in making evidence-informed decisions about implementing programs to reduce AMR, by identifying, describing, and assessing the full range of evaluated government policy options to reduce antimicrobial use in humans.
   Methods and findings
   Seven databases were searched from inception to January 28, 2019, (MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PAIS Index, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and PubMed). We identified studies that (1) clearly described a government policy intervention aimed at reducing human antimicrobial use, and (2) applied a quantitative design to measure the impact. We found 69 unique evaluations of government policy interventions carried out across 4 of the 6 WHO regions. These evaluations included randomized controlled trials (n = 4), non-randomized controlled trials (n = 3), controlled before-and-after designs (n = 7), interrupted time series designs (n = 25), uncontrolled before-and-after designs (n = 18), descriptive designs (n = 10), and cohort designs (n = 2). From these we identified 17 unique policy options for governments to reduce the human use of antimicrobials. Many studies evaluated public awareness campaigns (n = 17) and antimicrobial guidelines (n = 13); however, others offered different policy options such as professional regulation, restricted reimbursement, pay for performance, and prescription requirements. Identifying these policies can inform the development of future policies and evaluations in different contexts and health systems. Limitations of our study include the possible omission of unpublished initiatives, and that policies not evaluated with respect to antimicrobial use have not been captured in this review.
   Conclusions
   To our knowledge this is the first study to provide policy makers with synthesized evidence on specific government policy interventions addressing AMR. In the future, governments should ensure that AMR policy interventions are evaluated using rigorous study designs and that study results are published.

TI Mediating roles of preterm birth and restricted fetal growth in the
   relationship between maternal education and infant mortality: A Danish
   population-based cohort study

DT Article

AB Background
   Socioeconomic disparities in infant mortality have persisted for decades in high-income countries and may have become stronger in some populations. Therefore, new understandings of the mechanisms that underlie socioeconomic differences in infant deaths are essential for creating and implementing health initiatives to reduce these deaths. We aimed to explore whether and the extent to which preterm birth (PTB) and small for gestational age (SGA) at birth mediate the association between maternal education and infant mortality.
   Methods and findings
   We developed a population-based cohort study to include all 1,994,618 live singletons born in Denmark in 1981-2015. Infants were followed from birth until death, emigration, or the day before the first birthday, whichever came first. Maternal education at childbirth was categorized as low, medium, or high. An inverse probability weighting of marginal structural models was used to estimate the controlled direct effect (CDE) of maternal education on offspring infant mortality, further split into neonatal (0-27 days) and postneonatal (28-364 days) deaths, and portion eliminated (PE) by eliminating mediation by PTB and SGA. The proportion eliminated by eliminating mediation by PTB and SGA was reported if the mortality rate ratios (MRRs) of CDE and PE were in the same direction. The MRRs between maternal education and infant mortality were 1.63 (95% CI 1.48-1.80, P < 0.001) and 1.19 (95% CI 1.08-1.31, P < 0.001) for low and medium versus high education, respectively. The estimated proportions of these total associations eliminated by reducing PTB and SGA together were 55% (MRRPE = 1.27, 95% CI 1.15-1.40, P < 0.001) for low and 60% (MRRPE = 1.11, 95% CI 1.01-1.22, P = 0.037) for medium versus high education. The proportions eliminated by eliminating PTB and SGA separately were, respectively, 46% and 11% for low education (versus high education) and 48% and 13% for medium education (versus high education). PTB and SGA together contributed more to the association of maternal educational disparities with neonatal mortality (proportion eliminated: 75%-81%) than with postneonatal mortality (proportion eliminated: 21%-23%). Limitations of the study include the untestable assumption of no unmeasured confounders for the causal mediation analysis, and the limited generalizability of the findings to other countries with varying disparities in access and quality of perinatal healthcare.
   Conclusions
   PTB and SGA may play substantial roles in the relationship between low maternal education and infant mortality, especially for neonatal mortality. The mediating role of PTB appeared to be much stronger than that of SGA. Public health strategies aimed at reducing neonatal mortality in high-income countries may need to address socially related prenatal risk factors of PTB and impaired fetal growth. The substantial association of maternal education with postneonatal mortality not accounted for by PTB or SGA could reflect unaddressed educational disparities in infant care or other factors.

TI Using Item Response Theory to evaluate the psychometric characteristics
   of questions in a Brazilian programme and the performance of dental
   teams in primary care
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ORAL-HEALTH; QUALITY
AB Objectives
   First, to assess the psychometric properties of key questions included in a public sector evaluation of primary dental care in Brazil; and second, to evaluate the performance of dental teams in relation to these items.
   Methods
   Secondary analysis of a national primary care dataset monitoring quality and access to dental care. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews with representatives of dental teams participating in the 'National Programme for Improving Access and Quality of Primary Care'. Twenty-three mandatory questions about the dentists' reported delivery of dental procedures were included in the analysis. Item Response Theory (IRT) modelling was applied to measure the psychometric properties of the instrument-level of difficulty and discrimination parameter of each item-and then to estimate dental team performance scores based on these parameters. Based on IRT, possible scores ranged from -4 to + 4.
   Results
   Three of the 23 mandatory items were removed due to poor internal consistency, resulting in a scale of 20 items for assessing dental team performance. The results showed variation in procedures delivered by the dental teams; whilst more than a half of the procedures were executed by at least 80% of the dental teams, those relating to dentures (partial/total) and frenectomy (lingual/labial) were performed by less than 30%. Amongst the 20 items included in the model, those related to partial/total dentures and oral cancer follow-up presented higher levels of difficulty and were less frequently provided. The items relating to the treatment of deciduous teeth and access to the dental pulp of permanent teeth had the highest discrimination parameters and, consequently, greater weight in the performance's score estimation; therefore, dental teams that did not perform these items had the lowest performance scores. In the present study, dental team performance scores ranged from -3.66 to +1.87 with a mean/median of -0.06/+0.01.
   Conclusion
   The findings suggest that whilst the items within the instrument demonstrated some potential to discriminate between poor and very poor teams, they were ineffective in discriminating between poor and good teams. Whilst Brazilian dental teams perform many mandatory procedures, variation in the nature of their delivery of care requires further investigation to enhance service provision to the population.

AB Following the March 2011 accident at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, many residents of Fukushima have faced anxieties about the health impacts of radiation exposure. Considering that source of information may influence resident anxiety, this study aimed to elucidate the correlation between the two. In addition, a health literacy query was included to examine a possible relationship between anxiety and health literacy skills. A mail survey was conducted in August 2016 among 2000 residents of Fukushima Prefecture aged 20 to 79 years. Survey items included questions about current health anxieties caused by radiation, trusted sources of information about radiation, and media used to obtain information on radiation. The survey valid response rate was 43.4%. Results of multiple linear regression analysis revealed that anxiety was significantly higher for the groups indicating "trust in citizen groups" and "use of internet sites." Anxiety was significantly lower for the groups indicating "trust in government ministries," "trust in local government," and "use of local broadcast television." Also anxiety was significantly lower for groups with higher health literacy. It was found that the significant relationship to anxiety varies depending on the sources of trust and media used. There is a possibility that this was caused by the difference between the contents of each information and media reports. In preparation for any future nuclear accident, government may consider action to improve the media literacy of residents. In addition, improving health literacy of both the recipient and the sender of information can improve access to information and thereby safeguard the health and well-being of the public.

AB BackgroundTyphoid fever remains a major public health problem in Zimbabwe with recurrent outbreaks reported since 2009. To provide guidance on appropriate treatment choice in order to minimise the morbidity and mortality of typhoid fever and prevent large scale outbreaks, we investigated the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, prevalence of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S. Typhi) H58 haplotype and molecular subtypes of S. Typhi from outbreak strains isolated from 2009 to 2017 in Zimbabwe and compared these to isolates from neighbouring African countries.MethodsAntimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on all isolates using the disk diffusion, and E-Test, and results were interpreted using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines (2017). S. Typhi H58 haplotype screening was performed on 161 (58.3%) isolates. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed on 91 selected isolates across timelines using antibiotic susceptibility results and geographical distribution (2009 to 2016).ResultsBetween 2009 and 2017, 16,398 suspected cases and 550 confirmed cases of typhoid fever were notified in Zimbabwe. A total of 276 (44.6%) of the culture-confirmed S. Typhi isolates were analysed and 243 isolates (88.0%) were resistant to two or more first line drugs (ciprofloxacin, ampicillin and chloramphenicol) for typhoid. The most common resistance was to ampicillin-chloramphenicol (172 isolates; 62.3%). Increasing ciprofloxacin resistance was observed from 2012 to 2017 (4.2 to 22.0%). Out of 161 screened isolates, 150 (93.2%) were haplotype H58. Twelve PFGE patterns were observed among the 91 isolates analysed, suggesting some diversity exists among strains circulating in Zimbabwe. PFGE analysis of 2013, 2014 and 2016 isolates revealed a common strain with an indistinguishable PFGE pattern (100% similarity) and indistinguishable from PFGE patterns previously identified in strains isolated from South Africa, Zambia and Tanzania.ConclusionsResistance to first line antimicrobials used for typhoid fever is emerging in Zimbabwe and the multidrug resistant S. Typhi H58 haplotype is widespread. A predominant PFGE clone circulating in Zimbabwe, South Africa, Zambia and Tanzania, argues for cross-border cooperation in the control of this disease.

AB BackgroundAs the global burden of chronic disease grows, and infectious disease threats loom large, the need for medical graduates with expertise in public health medicine (PHM) is growing. A recurrent challenge is integrating this broad knowledge into crowded medical curricula and making PHM relevant. This study describes the process of integrating public health content into an Australian graduate entry medical course.MethodsA redesign of the PHM curriculum at Deakin University School of Medicine was conducted in 2014 to make the curriculum practice-based and solution-oriented. Central to the redesign was the development of a curriculum map.ResultsPublic health is now taught from a practice-based framework adapted from the World Health Organization emphasizing skills aligned with the Australasian Faculty of Public Health Medicine domains that prepare students for specialisation. Learning outcomes are structured to build depth and application in student knowledge. Mapping the curriculum provided the ability to measure alignment of learning outcomes with course, university and accrediting body outcomes. Regular feedback from students indicates engagement has improved along with perceived relevance to future careers.ConclusionsDoctors with public health skills are increasingly sought after in Australia, particularly in rural areas. Deakin graduates are well placed to meet this demand.

AB Background: This study compares an algorithm to detect acute gastroenteritis (AG) episodes from drug dispensing data to the validated data reported in a primary care surveillance system in France.
   Methods: We used drug dispensing data collected in a drugstore database and data collected by primary care physicians involved in a French surveillance network, from season 2014/15 to 2016/17. We used an adapted version of an AG discrimination algorithm to identify AG episodes from the drugstore database. We used Pearson's correlation coefficient to evaluate the agreement between weekly AG signals obtained from the two data sources during winter months, in the overall population, by specific age-groups and by regions.
   Results: Correlations between AG signals for all ages were 0.84 [95%CI 0.69; 0.92] for season 2014/15, 0.87 [95%CI 0.75; 0.93] for season 2015/16 and 0.94 [95%CI 0.88; 0.97] for season 2016/17. The association between AG signals estimated from two data sources varied significantly across age groups in season 2016/17 (p-value < 0.01), and across regions in all three seasons studied (p-value < 0.01).
   Conclusions: There is a strong agreement between the dynamic of AG activity estimated from drug dispensing data and from validated primary care surveillance data collected during winter months in the overall population but the agreement is poorer in several age groups and in several regions. Once automated, the reuse of drug dispensing data, already collected for reimbursement purposes, could be a cost-efficient method to monitor AG activity at the national level.

AB Background: Tobacco remains a leading cause of preventable death in the U.S., responsible for more than 440,000 deaths each year. Approximately 10% of these deaths are attributable to exposure of non-smokers to secondhand smoke (SHS). Residents living in public multi-unit housing (MUH) are at excess risk for SHS exposure compared to the general population. On November 30, 2016, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) passed a rule requiring all public housing agencies to implement smoke-free housing (SFH) policies in their housing developments by July 30, 2018.
   Methods: As part of a larger natural experiment study, we designed a protocol to evaluate indoor SHS levels before and after policy implementation through collection of repeat indoor air samples in non-smoking apartments and common areas of select high-rise NYCHA buildings subject to the HUD SFH rule, and also from socio-demographically matched private-sector high-rise control buildings not subject to the rule. A baseline telephone survey was conducted in all selected buildings to facilitate rapid recruitment into the longitudinal study and assess smoking prevalence, behaviors, and attitudes regarding the SFH policy prior to implementation. Data collection began in early 2018 and will continue through 2021.
   Discussion: The baseline survey was completed by 559 NYCHA residents and 471 comparison building residents (response rates, 35, and 32%, respectively). Smoking prevalence was comparable between study arms (15.7% among NYCHA residents and 15.2% among comparison residents). The majority of residents reported supporting a building-wide smoke-free policy (63.0 and 59.9%, respectively). We enrolled 157 NYCHA and 118 comparison non-smoking households into the longitudinal air monitoring study and performed air monitoring in common areas. Follow up surveys and air monitoring in participant households occur every 6 months for 2.5 years. Capitalizing on the opportunity of this federal policy rollout, the large and diverse public housing population in NYC, and robust municipal data sources, this study offers a unique opportunity to evaluate the policy's direct impacts on SHS exposure. Methods in this protocol can inform similar SFH policy evaluations elsewhere.

TI Naloxone urban legends and the opioid crisis: what is the role of public
   health?
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Naloxone; Opioids; Urban legends
ID HARM REDUCTION; USERS
AB As the overdose crisis in North America continues to deepen, public health leaders find themselves responding to sensational media stories, many of which carry forms and themes that mark them as urban legends.
   This article analyzes one set of media accounts - stories of misuse of naloxone, an opioid overdose antidote distributed to people who use drugs - through the lens of social science scholarship on urban legends. We suggest that these stories have met a public need to feel a sense of safety in uncertain times, but function to reinforce societal views of people who use drugs as undeserving of support and resources.
   Our field has a duty to speak out in favour of evidence-based programs that support the health of people who use drugs, but the optimal communication strategies are not always clear. Drawing attention to the functions and consequences of urban legends can help frame public health communication in a way that responds to needs without reinforcing prejudices, with application beyond naloxone to the other urban legends that continue to emerge in response to this crisis.

ID SWEETENED BEVERAGE TAX; FOOD; TOBACCO; CHILDREN; ALCOHOL; PRICE;
   RESTRICTION; CONSUMPTION; EXPOSURE; TAXATION
AB Background: Public health policy is inevitably associated with either a strong presence or lack of public support. We investigated factors associated with both the public support of and opposition to health taxes and the media regulation regarding advertising harmful products in Korea.
   Methods: We interviewed 1200 respondents that were recruited using an equal-probability sampling method in accordance with the 2016 Korean census. Our investigation examined the extent of support and opposition towards health taxes and the media regulation of advertising that targets the consumption of tobacco, alcohol, and unhealthy foods according to socioeconomic characteristics, health habits, body mass index (BMI), and exposure to the advertising of harmful products. The study was conducted using a univariate and stepwise multivariate regression analysis.
   Results: The majority (71.8%) of the respondents were supportive of imposing health taxes in general. Despite a high prevalence of tobacco and alcohol consumption among the respondents, they strongly supported media regulation of tobacco (72.3%), alcohol (63.7%), and eating broadcasts (51.9%) food advertising (44.0%). Those that were non-smokers, earned a high-income, were married, or had a child were likely to support at least one kind of regulation regarding alcohol and smoking related advertising. An exposure to excessive advertising of unhealthy products was associated with increase of respondents supporting the media regulation. Those who regarded the media as being influential seemed to be more supportive of health taxes or media regulation.
   Conclusion: Our results indicated strong public support among the respondents for health taxes and the media regulation regarding the advertising of unhealthy products. Based on our data, we are optimistic that countries whose population show a high rate of tobacco, alcohol or unhealthy food consumption may launch public policy in addressing these factors.

   INSECTICIDE; EFFICACY
AB Background: Thermal fogging of Insecticides is a vector control strategy used by the Medellin Secretary of Health to combat dengue. This method is employed during outbreaks to curb populations of potentially infectious adult mosquitoes and interrupt transmission cycles. While this strategy has been used in Medellin since 2007, in some years it has not reduced dengue cases as expected. Difficulties in the implementation of fumigation strategies, such as lack of opportunity for treatment and public perception may be factors that limit its utility. The objective of this study was to identify barriers that hinder the implementation of thermal fogging, as well as attitudes and beliefs that prevent its acceptance.
   Methods: We used a cross-sectional observational study of mixed methods carried out in neighborhoods prioritized for fumigation treatment in Medellin, Colombia. First, we assessed the timeliness of treatment by determining the latency period between reported dengue cases and the implementation of fumigation in response to those cases. Next, we administered structured questionnaires to residents in the area of fumigation treatments (n = 4455 homes) to quantify acceptance and rejection, as well as factors associated with rejection.
   Results: The median time between notification and treatment was 25 days (IQR 20.0-36.5). Fumigators were only able to treat 53.7% of total households scheduled for treatment; 9.6% rejected treatment, and treatment teams were unable to fumigate the remaining 36.7% of homes due to absent residents, no adults being present, and other reasons. The most frequent causes for rejection were residents being busy at the time of treatment (33.1%) and no interest in the treatment (24.5%). Other reasons for rejection include the perceptions that fumigation does not control pests other than mosquitoes (4.3%), that no mosquitoes were present in the home (3.3%), and that fumigation affects human health (3.1%).
   Conclusions: The high percentage of houses where it was not possible to perform fumigation limits control of the vector. Future strategies should consider more flexible treatment schedules and incorporate informational messages to educate residents about the safety and importance of treatment.

AB Detection of clusters of Legionnaires' disease, a leading waterborne cause of pneumonia, is challenging. Clusters vary in size and scope, are associated with a diverse range of aerosol producing devices, including exposures such as whirlpool spas and hotel water systems typically associated with travel, and can occur without an easily identified exposure source. Recently, jurisdictions have begun to use SaTScan spatio-temporal analysis software prospectively as part of routine cluster surveillance. We used data collected by the Active Bacterial Core surveillance platform to assess the ability of SaTScan to detect Legionnaires' disease clusters. We found that SaTScan analysis using traditional surveillance data and geocoded residential addresses was unable to detect many common Legionnaires' disease cluster types, such as those associated with travel or a prolonged time between cases. Additionally, signals from an analysis designed to simulate a real-time search for clusters did not align with clusters identified by traditional surveillance methods or a retrospective SaTScan analysis. A geospatial analysis platform better tailored to the unique characteristics of Legionnaires' disease epidemiology would improve cluster detection and decrease time to public health action.

AB Background
   Dynamic HIV transmission models can provide evidence-based guidance on optimal combination implementation strategies to treat and prevent HIV/AIDS. However, these models can be extremely data intensive, and the availability of good-quality data characterizing regional microepidemics varies substantially within and across countries. We aim to provide a comprehensive and transparent description of an evidence synthesis process and reporting framework employed to populate and calibrate a dynamic, compartmental HIV transmission model for six US cities.
   Methods
   We executed a mixed-method evidence synthesis strategy to populate model parameters in six categories: (i) initial HIV-negative and HIV-infected populations; (ii) parameters used to calculate the probability of HIV transmission; (iii) screening, diagnosis, treatment and HIV disease progression; (iv) HIV prevention programs; (v) the costs of medical care; and (vi) health utility weights for each stage of HIV disease progression. We identified parameters that required city-specific data and stratification by gender, risk group and race/ethnicity a priori and sought out databases for primary analysis to augment our evidence synthesis. We ranked the quality of each parameter using context- and domain-specific criteria and verified sources and assumptions with our scientific advisory committee.
   Findings
   To inform the 1,667 parameters needed to populate our model, we synthesized evidence from 59 peer-reviewed publications and 24 public health and surveillance reports and executed primary analyses using 11 data sets. Of these 1,667 parameters, 1,517 (91%) were city-specific and 150 (9%) were common for all cities. Notably, 1,074 (64%), 201 (12%) and 312 (19%) parameters corresponded to categories (i), (ii) and (iii), respectively. Parameters ranked as best-to moderate-quality evidence comprised 39% of the common parameters and ranged from 56%-60% across cities for the city-specific parameters. We identified variation in parameter values across cities as well as within cities across risk and race/ethnic groups.
   Conclusions
   Better integration of modelling in decision making can be achieved by systematically reporting on the evidence synthesis process that is used to populate models, and by explicitly assessing the quality of data entered into the model. The effective communication of this process can help prioritize data collection of the most informative components of local HIV prevention and care services in order to reduce decision uncertainty and strengthen model conclusions.

AB For many years, tuberculosis (TB) has been a major public health problem worldwide. Advances for treatment and eradication have been very limited. Silymarin (Sm) is a natural product with antioxidant and hepatoprotective activities that has been proposed as a complementary medicine to reduce the liver injury produced by the conventional anti-TB chemotherapy. Sm also has immunoregulatory and microbicide properties. In this study, we determined the effect of Sm on the growth control of mycobacteria. In vitro studies showed that Sm and Silibinin (the principal active compound of Sm) have microbicidal activity against drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant (MDR) mycobacteria, induce the production of protective cytokines from infected macrophages, and improve the growth control of mycobacteria (p <= 0.0001). Studies in vivo using a model of progressive pulmonary TB in BALB/c mice infected with drug-sensitive or MDR mycobacteria have shown that Sm induces significant expression of Th-1 cytokines such as IFN-gamma and IL-12 as well as TNF alpha, which produce significant therapeutic activity when administered alone and apparently have a synergistic effect with chemotherapy. These results suggest that Sm has a bactericidal effect and can contribute to the control and establishment of a T(H)1 protective immune response against mycobacterial infection. Thus, it seems that this flavonoid has a promising potential as adjuvant therapy in the treatment of TB.

AB BackgroundStaphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococci (BHS) diseases disproportionately affect populations in middle/low-income countries. To assess if this disparity is reflected in colonization by these organisms, we compared their colonization frequency among children from different socioeconomic status (SES) communities in a city with high income inequality.MethodsBetween May-August 2014, we collected nasal and throat swabs to investigate S. aureus and BHS colonization among children who attended private and public pediatric clinics. Patients were classified as high SES, middle/low SES, and slum residents. We investigated the antimicrobial resistance profile, the SCCmec types and the presence of PVL genes among methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). We also examined the antimicrobial resistance profile and serogroups of BHS.ResultsOf 598 children, 221 (37%) were colonized with S. aureus, of which 49 (22%) were MRSA. MRSA colonization was higher in middle/low SES (n=18; 14%) compared with high SES (n=17; 6%) and slum (n=14; 8%) residents (p=0.01). All MRSA strains were susceptible to clindamycin, nitrofurantoin, and rifampin. The highest non-susceptibility frequency (42.9%) was observed to erythromycin. SCCmec type V was only found in isolates from high SES children; types I and II were found only in middle/low SES children. Ten (20%) MRSA isolates carried PVL genes. Twenty-four (4%) children were BHS carriers. All BHS (n=8) found in high SES children and six (67%) isolates from slum patients belonged to group A. All group B streptococci were from middle/low SES children, corresponding to five (71%) of the seven BHS isolated in this group. BHS isolates were susceptible to all drugs tested.ConclusionsChildren from different SES communities had distinct bacterial colonization profiles, including MRSA carriage. Public health officials/researchers should consider SES when assessing disease transmission and control measures.

AB BackgroundShigella spp., facultative anaerobic bacilli of the family Enterobacteriaceae, are one of the most common causes of diarrheal diseases in human worldwide which have become a significant public health burden. So, we aimed to analyze the antimicrobial phenotypes and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones in Shigella isolates from patients with diarrhea in Shanxi Province.ResultsDuring 2006-2016, we isolated a total of 474 Shigella strains (including 337S. flexneri and 137S. sonnei). The isolates showed high rates of resistance to traditional antimicrobials, and 26, 18.1 and 3.0% of them exhibited resistance to cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and co-resistance to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, respectively. Notably, 91.1% of these isolates, including 22 isolates that showed an ACTSuT profile, exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR). The resistance rates to cephalosporins in S. sonnei isolates were higher than those in S. flexneri. Conversely, the resistance rates to fluoroquinolones were considerably higher in S. flexneri isolates. Among the 123 cephalosporins-resistant isolates, the most common extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene was bla(TEM-1), followed by bla(CTX-M), bla(OXA-1), and bla(SHV-12). Six subtypes of bla(CTX-M) were identified, bla(CTX-M-14) (n=36) and bla(CTX-M-55) (n=26) were found to be dominant. Of all the 86 isolates with resistance to fluoroquinolones and having at least one mutation (Ser83Leu, His211Tyr, or Asp87Gly) in the the quinolone resistance-determining regions of gyrA, 79 also had mutation of parC (Ser80Ile), whereas 7 contained plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes including qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, and aac(60)-Ib-cr. Furthermore, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis (PFGE) showed a considerable genetic diversity in S. flexneri isolates. However, the S. sonnei isolates had a high genetic similarity.ConclusionsCoexistence of diverse resistance genes causing the emergence and transmission of MDR might render the treatment of shigellosis difficult. Therefore, continuous surveillance might be needed to understand the actual disease burden and provide guidance for shigellosis.

AB BackgroundFollowing implementation in 2009-2010 to the oral health component for the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a full-mouth periodontal examination was continued during 2011-2014. Additionally, a comprehensive dental caries assessment was re-introduced in 2011 after a 6-year absence from NHANES. This report provides oral health content information and results of dental examiner reliability statistics for key intraoral assessments conducted by dentists during 2011-2014.MethodsDuring the 2011-2014 NHANES 17,463 persons age 1 and older representing the US civilian, non-institutionalized population received an oral health examination. From this group, 387 individuals underwent a repeat examination conducted by the survey reference examiner. A combination of examiner training and calibration, electronic data capture, and ongoing performance evaluation with statistical monitoring was used to ensure conformance with NHANES protocols and data comparability to prior data collection periods.ResultsDuring 2011-2014, the Kappa statistics for the tooth count assessment ranged from 0.96 to 1.00, for untreated dental caries Kappa scores were 0.93 to 1.00. The overall Kappa statistics for identifying combined moderate-severe periodontitis using the CDC/AAP case definition was 0.66 and 0.69 with percent agreement of 83 to 85% during 2011-2014. When evaluating inter-examiner agreement using information collected from 3 periodontal sites for comparability to the NHANES 2003-04 periodontal examination protocols, Kappa scores for combined moderate-severe periodontitis was 0.65 and 0.80 during 2011-2014. For total mean attachment loss and pocket depth across all 6 periodontal sites, the inter-class coefficients (ICCs) ranged from 0.80-0.90 and 0.79-0.86 respectively. Site-specific mean attachment loss ICCs were generally higher for the 4 interproximal measurements compared to the 2 mid-site probing measurements and this observation was similar in 2009-2010.ConclusionDuring 2011-2014, results overall indicate a high level of data quality and substantial examiner reliability for tooth count and dentition; reliability for periodontal disease, across various assessments, was at least moderate. When comparing the 2011-2014 examiner performance to findings from 2003 to 2004, comparable concordance between the examiners and the reference examiner exists.

AB BackgroundInfectious diseases spread through inherently spatial processes. Road and air traffic data have been used to model these processes at national and global scales. At metropolitan scales, however, mobility patterns are fundamentally different and less directly observable. Estimating the spatial distribution of infection has public health utility, but few studies have investigated this at an urban scale. In this study we address the question of whether the use of urban-scale mobility data can improve the prediction of spatial patterns of influenza infection. We compare the use of different sources of urban-scale mobility data, and investigate the impact of other factors relevant to modelling mobility, including mixing within and between regions, and the influence of hub and spoke commuting patterns.MethodsWe used journey-to-work (JTW) data from the Australian 2011 Census, and GPS journey data from the Sygic GPS Navigation & Maps mobile app, to characterise population mixing patterns in a spatially-explicit SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) meta-population model.ResultsUsing the JTW data to train the model leads to an increase in the proportion of infections that arise in central Melbourne, which is indicative of the city's spoke-and-hub road and public transport networks, and of the commuting patterns reflected in these data. Using the GPS data increased the infections in central Melbourne to a lesser extent than the JTW data, and produced a greater heterogeneity in the middle and outer regions. Despite the limitations of both mobility data sets, the model reproduced some of the characteristics observed in the spatial distribution of reported influenza cases.ConclusionsUrban mobility data sets can be used to support models that capture spatial heterogeneity in the transmission of infectious diseases at a metropolitan scale. These data should be adjusted to account for relevant urban features, such as highly-connected hubs where the resident population is likely to experience a much lower force of infection that the transient population. In contrast to national and international scales, the relationship between mobility and infection at an urban level is much less apparent, and requires a richer characterisation of population mobility and contact.

AB BackgroundTuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease in Ethiopia, killing more than 30 thousand people every year. This study aimed to determine whether the rates of poor TB treatment outcome varied geographically across Ethiopia at district and zone levels and whether such variability was associated with socioeconomic, behavioural, health care access, or climatic conditions.MethodsA geospatial analysis was conducted using national TB data reported to the health management information system (HMIS), for the period 2015-2017. The prevalence of poor TB treatment outcomes was calculated by dividing the sum of treatment failure, death and loss to follow-up by the total number of TB patients. Binomial logistic regression models were computed and a spatial analysis was performed using a Bayesian framework. Estimates of parameters were generated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. Geographic clustering was assessed using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic, and global and local Moran's I statistics.ResultsA total of 223,244TB patients were reported from 722 districts in Ethiopia during the study period. Of these, 63,556 (28.5%) were cured, 139,633 (62.4%) completed treatment, 6716 (3.0%) died, 1459 (0.7%) had treatment failure, and 12,200 (5.5%) were lost to follow-up. The overall prevalence of a poor TB treatment outcome was 9.0% (range, 1-58%). Hot-spots and clustering of poor TB treatment outcomes were detected in districts near the international borders in Afar, Gambelia, and Somali regions and cold spots were detected in Oromia and Amhara regions. Spatial clustering of poor TB treatment outcomes was positively associated with the proportion of the population with low wealth index (OR: 1.01; 95%CI: 1.0, 1.01), the proportion of the population with poor knowledge about TB (OR: 1.02; 95%CI: 1.01, 1.03), and higher annual mean temperature per degree Celsius (OR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.21).ConclusionsThis study showed significant spatial variation in poor TB treatment outcomes in Ethiopia that was related to underlying socioeconomic status, knowledge about TB, and climatic conditions. Clinical and public health interventions should be targeted in hot spot areas to reduce poor TB treatment outcomes and to achieve the national End-TB Strategy targets.

AB BackgroundThis paper outlines the methodology, study population and response rate of a third large Dutch population-based cross-sectional serosurvey carried-out in 2016/2017, primarily aiming to obtain insight into age-specific seroprevalence of vaccine-preventable diseases to evaluate the National Immunization Programme (NIP). In addition, Caribbean Netherlands (CN) was included, which enables additional research into tropical pathogens.MethodsA two-stage cluster sampling technique was used to draw a sample of Dutch residents (0-89years) (NS), including an oversampling of non-Western migrants, persons living in low vaccination coverage (LVC) areas, and an extra sample of persons born in Suriname, Aruba and the former Dutch Antilles (SAN). A separate sample was drawn for each Caribbean island. At the consultation hours, questionnaires, blood samples, oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs, faeces, - and only in the Netherlands (NL) saliva and a diary about contact patterns - were obtained from participants. Vaccination- and medical history was retrieved, and in CN anthropometric measurements were taken.ResultsIn total, blood samples and questionnaires were collected from 9415 persons: 5745 (14.4%) in the NS (including the non-Western migrants), 1354 (19.8%) in LVC areas, 501 (6.9%) SAN, and 1815 (23.4%) in CN.ConclusionsThis study will give insight into protection of the population against infectious diseases included in the NIP. Research based on this large biobank will contribute to public health (policy) in NL and CN, e.g., regarding outbreak management and emerging pathogens. Further, we will be able to extend our knowledge on infectious diseases and its changing dynamics by linking serological data to results from additional materials collected, environmental- and pharmacological data.

ID DIPTERA-SIMULIIDAE; ONCHOCERCIASIS; REGION
AB BackgroundOnchocerciasis is caused by a nematode worm Onchocerca volvulus, which is transmitted in Sudan by black fly vectors of the Simulium damnosum sensu lato species complex. In Sudan, the disease is found in four foci where fast flowing rivers provide suitable breeding sites for the Simulium vector flies. The construction of dams and irrigation schemes for agricultural purposes has affected black fly breeding and distribution, such as in Merowe Dam in Abu-Hamed focus, where the perennially flowing water downstream of the Dam created new vector breeding sites, thereby, changing the pattern of disease transmission and creating public health problems. Based on this situation, this study was carried out to measure the effect of the Upper Atbara and Setit Dam complex on the distribution of Simulium damnosum s.l. breeding sites and on disease elimination in the Galabat sub-focus in eastern Sudan.MethodsAquatic stages of Simulium were collected between October and November 2009, prior to the construction of the dam complex, and again in 2013 and 2015 while the dam complex construction was ongoing.ResultsA total of 40 breeding sites were identified at the beginning of the study. After the construction of the dam complex in 2015, seventeen previously mapped breeding sites were inaccessible as they had been flooded by the dam complex's lake when reach its maximum size. Three species were obtained from different locations: S. damnosum s.l., S. griseicolle, and S. adersi.ConclusionsThis study has shown a link between the construction of the dam complex and a reduction in the breeding sites of black fly vectors. This reduction has limited the Galabat sub-focus to a small area at the upper Atbara River which become the end of the focus. To sustain the success achieved in onchocerciasis control in the Galabat sub-focus, disease control and its vector control should be strengthened in the area cross-boarding Sudan and Ethiopia.

AB BackgroundChronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are being developed and implemented in order to improve clinical practice related to the detection and treatment of CKD. The objective of our study was to evaluate the quality of CPGs regarding the CKD and to examine whether there are factors which influence their quality.MethodsA systematic search was conducted to identify all CPGs regarding the early diagnosis and treatment of CKD. The CPGs quality were evaluated by three reviewers using the AGREE II instrument to decide if the guidelines are recommended for their use in clinical practice.ResultsIn total, 13 CPGs were identified: five from America, six from Europe, one from Asia, and one from Oceania. Five CPGs were recommended for their use in clinical practice; since all their domains achieved the medium or high category. Furthermore, six CPGs were recommended with modifications, as the stakeholders' involvement, applicability, and editorial independence domains were evaluated as low category. These domains, as well as the rigor of the development domain, reached the very low category in those CPGs that were not recommended for its use in clinical practice. In all CPGs, the domains with the lowest average were the stakeholder involvement and the applicability. When comparing the domains of the CPGs according to the origin, type of developer group, the checklist used during the development and the publication period, a significantly higher average in the domain stakeholder involvement was found in the CPGs from Asia and Oceania compared to the ones in Latin America. Additionally, a significantly higher average in the applicability domain was found in the CPGs developed by CPGs developer organizations compared to those developed by medical societies.ConclusionsIn total, 85% of the CPGs regarding CKD were recommended or recommended with modifications. The stakeholder involvement and applicability domains are assessed in the low category, which might affect the CPGs implementation. In order to save resources in low- and middle-income countries, an adaptation of the recommended CPGs should be considered.

ID STROKE SYMPTOMS; HEALTH; AWARENESS; ASSOCIATION; ILLNESS
AB BackgroundEarly identification of stroke symptoms and rapid access to the emergency services increases an individual's chance of receiving thrombolytic therapy and reduces the likelihood of infirmity. The UK's national stroke campaign Act FAST' was developed to increase public awareness of stroke symptoms and highlighted the importance of rapid response by contacting emergency services. No study to date has assessed if and how people who experienced or witnessed stroke in line with the campaigns' symptoms of the FAST acronym (i.e., facial weakness, arm weakness, slurred speech, and time) may use this FAST in their response.MethodsSemi-structured interviews with 13 stroke patients and witnesses were conducted. Interviews were theory-guided based on the Common Sense Self-Regulation Model, to understand the appraisal process of the onset of stroke symptoms and how this impacted on participants' ability to apply their knowledge of the FAST campaign.ResultsThe majority of patients (n=8/13) failed to correctly identify stroke and reported no impact of the campaign on their stroke recognition and response. Inability to identify stroke, perceiving symptoms to lack severity and lack of control contributed to a delay in seeking medical attention.ConclusionStroke witnesses and patients predominantly fail to identify stroke which suggest a lack of FAST application when it matters. Inaccurate risk perceptions and lack of physical control both play central roles in influencing the formation of illness representation not associated with an appropriate emergency response.

ID CHILDHOOD OBESITY PREVENTION; READINESS MODEL
AB BackgroundGhana has reached an advanced stage of nutrition transition, contributing to an increase in nutrition-related non-communicable diseases, particularly amongst urban women. Community involvement is an important factor in the success of efforts to promote healthy eating. The readiness of populations to accept a range of interventions needs to be understood before appropriate interventions can be implemented. Therefore, this study assessed how ready urban communities are to improve diets of women of reproductive age in Ghana.MethodsUsing the Community Readiness Model (CRM), in-depth interviews were conducted with 24 key informants from various sectors in low income communities across two cities in Ghana: Accra and Ho. The CRM consists of 36 open questions addressing five readiness dimensions (community knowledge of efforts, leadership, community climate, knowledge of the issue and resources). Interviews were scored using the CRM protocol with a maximum of 9 points per dimension (from 1=no awareness to 9=high level of community ownership). Thematic analysis was undertaken to gain insights of community factors that could affect the implementation of interventions to improve diets.ResultsThe mean community readiness scores indicated that both communities were in the vague awareness stage (3.350.54 (Accra) and 3.94 +/- 0.41 (Ho)). CRM scores across the five dimensions ranged from 2.65-4.38/9, ranging from denial/resistance to pre-planning. In both communities, the mean readiness score for knowledge of the issue' was the highest of all dimensions (4.10 +/- 1.61 (Accra); 4.38 +/- 1.81 (Ho)), but was still only at the pre-planning phase. The lowest scores were found for community knowledge of efforts (denial/resistance; 2.65 +/- 2.49 (Accra)) and resources (vague awareness; 3.35 +/- 1.03 (Ho)). The lack of knowledge of the consequences of unhealthy diets, misconceptions of the issue partly from low education, as well as challenges faced from a lack of resources to initiate/sustain programmes explained the low readiness.Conclusions p id=Par4 Despite recognising that unhealthy diets are a public health issue in these urban Ghanaian communities, it is not seen as a priority. The low community readiness ratings highlight the need to increase awareness of the issue prior to intervening to improve diets.

ID FOOD CHOICES
AB BackgroundEating out is now common and food served out of the home is often of low nutritional quality. Kilocalorie (kcal) labelling of food and drink products sold in restaurant chains in the US is now mandatory, although in store kcal labelling practices among major UK restaurant and takeaway chains have not been examined.MethodsDuring August 2018, we contacted, visited the website and/or retail outlets of major eating out and takeaway food chains in the UK, including full-service and fast-food restaurants, cafes and coffee shops, some of which had previously made a voluntary pledge to provide kcal labelling. We examined the proportion of chains providing kcal information to customers at point of choice in store and the extent to which kcal information provision adhered to labelling recommendations. We also examined the proportion of chains that did not have point of choice kcal labelling but were able to provide kcal information on request. The study protocol was pre-registered on the Open Science Framework.ResultsOf the 104 eligible chains, only a small minority (18 chains, 17%) provided in store kcal labelling. Of those that did, provision of kcal information tended not to adhere to recommended labelling practices. Of the 16 eligible chains that had previously committed to a voluntary public health pledge to provide point of choice kcal labelling, labelling did not meet recommendations and 4 (25%) did not provide kcal labelling. Of the 86 chains that did not provide kcal labelling in store, kcal information was available on request from 43 (50%) chains.ConclusionsIt is rare for eating out and takeaway chains in the UK to provide point of choice kcal labelling and when labelling is provided it does not adhere to recommended labelling practices. Chains that previously volunteered to provide kcal labelling as part of an industry and public health partnership do so inadequately. Voluntary policies have not resulted in adequate kcal labelling in the UK eating out of home sector.

AB BackgroundHandwashing prevalence in schools in Kenya is low due to lack of access to water and soap and lack of drive for handwashing. Soapy water made from detergent powder is an inexpensive alternative to bar soap and disgust and social norms change can be powerful drivers of handwashing, but their effectiveness has not been assessed in school setting. In Kenyan public schools, we evaluated an equipment-behavior change intervention's effect on handwashing outcomes. We also monitored functionality of the Povu Poa prototypes to identify design improvements necessary for continued high usage in institutional settings.MethodsThe intervention included the Povu Poa, a new type of handwashing station that dispensed foaming soap and rinse water, combined with school-wide behavior change promotion based on disgust and social norms. In this stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial, we randomly selected 30 schools and divided them into 3 groups of 10. Following baseline data collection, we delivered the intervention sequentially (Group 1: 3-5weeks after baseline; Group 2: 6-8weeks; Group 3: 19-24weeks). We observed outcomes [1] availability of handwashing materials at handwashing places, and; 2) observed handwashing behavior after toilet use among schoolchildren) at baseline and in three follow-up rounds. We compared the outcomes between schools that had received the intervention and schools that had not yet received the intervention.ResultsWater and soap/soapy water were available at 2% of school visits before intervention, and at 42% of school visits after intervention.. Before intervention, we observed handwashing with water after 11% of 461 toilet use events; no one was observed to wash hands with soap/soapy water. After intervention, we observed handwashing after 62% of 383 toilet use events (PR=5.96, 95% CI=3.02, 11.76) and handwashing with soap/soapy water after 26% of events (PR incalculable). Foaming soap dispenser caps were cracked in 31% of all observations, but were typically still functional.ConclusionsOur combined equipment-behavior intervention increased availability of handwashing materials and improved the compliance with handwashing after using the toilet, but handwashing with soap was still rare. Equipment durability must be improved for deployment in schools at scale.American Economic Association's Registry for Randomized Controlled Trials; Trial Registry Number (TRN): AEARCTR-0000662; Date of Registry: April 14, 2015.

AB Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a negative-sense RNA virus belonging to the Phenuiviridae family that infects both domestic livestock and humans. The NIAID has designated RVFV as a Category A priority emerging pathogen due to the devastating public health outcomes associated with epidemic outbreaks. However, there is no licensed treatment or vaccine approved for human use. Therefore it is of great interest to understand RVFV pathogenesis in infected hosts in order to facilitate creation of targeted therapies and treatment options. Here we provide insight into the host-pathogen interface in human HEK293 cells during RVFV MP-12 strain infection using high-throughput mRNA sequencing technology. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis of differentially expressed genes showed robust innate immune and cytokine-mediated inflammatory pathway activation as well as alterations in pathways associated with fatty acid metabolism and extracellular matrix receptor signaling. We also analyzed the promoter regions of DEGs for patterns in transcription factor binding sites, and found several that are known to act synergistically to impact apoptosis, immunity, metabolism, and cell growth and differentiation. Lastly, we noted dramatic changes in host alternative splicing patterns in genes associated with mRNA decay and surveillance, RNA transport, and DNA repair. This study has improved our understanding of RVFV pathogenesis and has provided novel insight into pathways and signaling modules important for RVFV diagnostics and therapeutic development.

AB Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) belongs to a larger group of primate T-cell lymphotropic viruses (PTLVs) within the family Retroviridae. It is estimated that 10 to 20 million people worldwide may be infected with HTLV-1. Although most of them are asymptomatic, around 5% of infected individuals may develop either HTLV-1 Associated Myelopathy/Tropical Spastic Paraparesis (HAM/TSP) or Adult T-cell Leukaemia/Lymphoma (ATLL). Public Health authorities in many countries have implemented routine blood-donor tests for HTLV-specific antibodies; but this is not the case for Germany since the reported prevalence is very low (7/100,000). With the aim to evaluate retrospectively the presence of HTLV-1 among oncology patients in this country, samples stored at the Universitatsklinikum Freiburg, were analyzed. For this purpose, two different nested-PCR (n-PCR) protocols have been modified and set up for HTLV-1 detection. One positive case was detected by n-PCR among 406 samples (0,25%) in a period of 5 years (2008-2012) corresponding to a T-Cell Lymphoma. Despite the low prevalence, this virus is circulating in Germany, probably due to the increasing numbers of immigrants in these last years. Physicians should consider HTLV-1 infection and suspect it taking in account the ethnic and relation to endemic regions regardless the patient's residence.

AB BackgroundCyberbullying is a growing public health concern threatening the well-being of adolescents in both developed and developing countries. In Taiwan, qualitative research exploring the experiences and perceptions of cyberbullying among Taiwanese young people is lacking.MethodsWe conducted in-depth interviews with a convenience sample of high school students (aged 16 to 18) from five schools in Taipei, Taiwan, without prior knowledge of their cyberbullying experiences. In total, 48 participants were interviewed.ResultsWe found that the experience of cyberbullying is common, frequently occurs anonymously and publicly on unofficial school Facebook pages created by students themselves, and manifests in multiple ways, such as name-calling, uploading photos, and/or excluding victims from online groups of friends. Exclusion, which may be a type of cyberbullying unique to the Asian context, causes a sense of isolation, helplessness, or hopelessness, even producing mental health effects in the victims because people place the utmost importance on interpersonal harmony due to the Confucian values in collectivistic Asian societies. In addition, our study revealed reasons for cyberbullying that also potentially reflect the collectivistic values of Asian societies. These reasons included fun, discrimination, jealousy, revenge, and punishment of peers who broke school or social rules/norms, for example, by cheating others or being promiscuous.ConclusionsOur findings reveal the pressing need for the Taiwanese school system to develop cyberbullying prevention programmes considering the nature and sociocultural characteristics of cyberbullying.

ID NETWORK
AB BackgroundVaccination has been one of the most successful public health interventions to date, and the U.S. FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) currently contains more than 500,000 reports for post-vaccination adverse events that occur after the administration of vaccines licensed in the United States. The VAERS dataset is huge, contains very large dimension nominal variables, and is complex due to multiple listing of vaccines and adverse symptoms in a single report. So far there has not been any statistical analysis conducted in attempting to identify the cross-board patterns on how all reported adverse symptoms are related to the vaccines.MethodsFor studies of the relationship between vaccines and reported adverse events, we consider a partial VAERS dataset which includes all reports filed over a period of 24 years between 1990-2013. We propose a neighboring method to process this dataset for dealing with the complications caused by multiple listing of vaccines and adverse symptoms in a single report. Then, the combined approaches based on our neighboring method and novel utilization of data visualization techniques are employed to analyze the large dimension dataset for characterization of the cross-board patterns of the relations between all reported vaccines and events.ResultsThe results of our analysis indicate that those events or symptoms with overall high occurrence frequencies are positively correlated, and those most frequently occurred adverse symptoms are mostly uncorrelated or negatively correlated under different bacteria vaccines, but they are in many cases positively correlated under different virus vaccines, especially under flu vaccines. No particular patterns are shown under live vs. inactive vaccines.ConclusionsThis article identifies certain cross-board patterns of the relationship between the vaccines and the reported adverse events or symptoms. This helps for better understanding the VAERS data, and provides a useful starting point for the development of statistical models and procedures to further analyze the VAERS data.

AB The estimated dietary intake (EDI) of essential elements selenium (Se), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn) and copper (Cu) has not been previously investigated for Najran city, Saudi Arabia. This type of information can be valuable for protecting public health. The aim of this study was to estimate the EDI of these elements. A food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was completed by the study participants (n = 80) to obtain dietary intake of selected staple foods (rice, wheat, meat and chicken). The concentrations of Se, Zn, Mn and Cu in these staple foods were determined using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The ranges of concentrations (mg/kg, wet weight) were as follows: Se (0.07-0.24), Zn (3.91-20.89), Mn (0.63-14.69) and Cu (0.69-2.41). The calculated ranges of EDIs (mg/kg bw/day) for the essential elements were as follows: Se 9.55 x 10(-5) -5.75 x 10(-4), Zn 1.33 x 10(-2)-5.83 x 10(-2), Mn 1.49 x 10(-3)-3.31 x 10(-2), Cu 1.65 x 10(-3)-5.42 x 10(-3). The highest EDI for Cu and Mn came from wheat. In the case of Se and Zn, the foods that contributed the highest EDI were chicken and meat, respectively. The lowest EDIs were found for Se in wheat, Zn in rice and both Mn and Cu in chicken. The percentages (%) of provisional maximum tolerable daily intake (PMTDI) for Se, Zn, Mn and Cu were 13%, 11%, 14% and 3.4%, respectively when contributions from all the four classes of foods were combined. The percentage of the recommended daily allowance (RDA) derived from these foods were 80%, 20%, 17% and 5.6% for Se, Zn, Mn and Cu were, respectively. This raises the possibility of Cu deficiency in the Najran population. However, a total diet study and human biomonitoring study is needed in the future to fully assess if people in Najran city are at risk of deficiency or excessive exposure to trace elements.

AB Fresh produce outbreaks due to Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) continue to occur in the United States (US). Manure-amended soils can pose a public health risk when used for growing raw agricultural commodities. Knowing the prevalence and concentration of STEC in untreated biological soil amendments of animal origin (BSAAO) is important to help guide the most appropriate pre-harvest interval(s) following application to limit risks from these soil amendments. Bovine manure samples were collected from 12 farms in Florida, including samples from piles, lagoons, barns, and screened solids. Two methods were used to detect stx1/2 and rfbE genes in samples. A prevalence rate of 9% for stx1 and/or stx2 and 19% for rfbE was observed from the 518 bovine manure samples evaluated. A most probable number (MPN) assay was performed on stx+ samples when applicable. The geometric mean for stx+ samples (n = 20) was 3.37 MPN g(-1) (0.53 log MPN g(-1)) with a maximum value of 6,800 MPN g(-1) (3.83 log MPN g(-1)). This research was part of a larger nationwide geographical study on the prevalence and concentration of STEC in bovine manure to help guide regulations on feasible pre-harvest intervals for the application of untreated BSAAO.

AB The study of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in the United States has identified a growing prevalence of the disorder across the country, a high economic burden for necessary treatment, and important gaps in insurance for individuals with autism. Confronting these facts, states have moved quickly in recent years to introduce mandates that insurers provide coverage for autism care. This study analyzes these autism insurance mandates and demonstrates that while states have moved swiftly to introduce them, the generosity of the benefits they mandate insurers provide varies dramatically across states. Furthermore, our research finds that controlling for policy need, interest group activity, economic circumstances, the insurance environment, and other factors, the passage of these mandates and differences in their generosity are driven by the ideology of state residents and politicians-with more generous benefits in states with more liberal citizens and increased Democratic control of state government. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for the study of health policy, politics, and autism in America.

AB In many countries, such as the US, Germany, France, and the Netherlands, governments are dealing with a great shortage of organ donors. Even though people generally show positive attitudes towards organ donation, they often do not actually register as organ donors themselves. This study's objective was to explore prevailing viewpoints among the Dutch population on deceased organ donation and the relation between aspects of the viewpoints potentially influencing the decision to register as an organ donor. Although substantive research about attitudes on organ donation has been conducted, this is the first study investigating people's viewpoints focusing on the relation between beliefs, tastes, preferences, motives, goals and other constituents underlying people's viewpoints on organ donation, such as the role of the media and public policies. This Q-methodology study revealed four viewpoints: "not donating your organs is a waste", "it does not go with my religion", "my family should decide"; and "it's a good deed, but I'm doubtful". These viewpoints convey information on potential reasons for the gap between people's favourable attitudes towards organ donation and the low number of actual registrations, and opportunities for policy makers to address certain target groups more adequately.

AB BackgroundThe onus of providing affordable access to specialist services in rural India primarily lies with publicly funded rural hospitals, also known as community health centres (CHCs). However, no studies have attempted to measure the change in the shortage and distributional inequalities of specialists in the publicly funded rural hospitals of Uttar Pradesh (India). This study attempts to fill that gap.MethodsThe study uses data from the three latest rounds of the District-Level Household Survey, covering a period of 10 years spanning from 2002 to 2012. Shortages were measured against the Indian Public Health Standards for CHCs, and inequalities were measured using Gini and Theil indices, with the latter decomposed to reveal the source of the inequalities. Negative binomial regression was applied to examine the association between facility characteristics and the availability of specialists in CHCs.ResultsThe current shortage of specialists stands at 80.7% of the total requirement. Currently, 62.1% of CHCs are functioning without a specialist. The distribution of specialists across CHCs has become progressively uneven over the study period, as shown by the rise in the Gini index (from 0.41 in 2002-2004 to 0.74 in 2012-2013). Decomposition analysis reveals that the contribution of within-district inequalities to overall inequality remains high (85.4% of total inequality). About 50% of within-district inequality is contributed by only 20 districts, most of which belong to eastern and central Uttar Pradesh. The analysis of factors affecting the distribution of the current specialist workforce revealed that the number of available specialists at a CHC is positively associated with the availability of residences for doctors and regular electricity supply, and negatively associated with CHC location and the distance of the CHC from the district headquarters.ConclusionThe findings suggest that Uttar Pradesh not only needs to recruit more specialists, but it also requires proper implementation of deployment and retention policies to ensure equitable access to specialist care for rural populations. Ensuring the availability of quality accommodations and basic amenities at all CHCs, as well as adequate transport and rural allowance, could help increase the chances of specialists staying in rural and far-off CHCs.

ID ACCEPTANCE
AB BackgroundIn Iowa from 2014 to 2017, there were 2 separate public dental benefit programs for Medicaid-enrolled adults: one for the Medicaid expansion population called the Dental Wellness Plan (DWP), and one for the traditional, non-expansion adult Medicaid population. The programs differed with respect to reimbursement, administration, and benefit structure. This study explored differences in patterns and predictors of dentist participation in the two programs.MethodsAuthors sent a survey to all private practice dentists in Iowa (n=1301) 2years after DWP implementation. Descriptive, bivariate, and logistic regression analyses were used to examine patterns and predictors of dentist participation in Medicaid and DWP.ResultsOverall rates of dentists' acceptance of new Medicaid and DWP patients were 45 and 43%, respectively. However, Medicaid participants were much more likely than DWP participants to place limits on patient acceptance. Adjusting for other factors, practice busyness was the only significant predictor of DWP participation, and practice location was the only significant predictor of Medicaid participation. Dentists who were not busy enough were more than twice as likely to participate in DWP compared to others, and dentists in rural areas were almost twice as likely to participate in Medicaid compared to dentists in urban areas.ConclusionsDentist participation in Medicaid is an ongoing concern for states aiming to ensure access to dental care for low-income populations. We found distinct participation patterns and predictors between a traditional Medicaid dental program and the DWP, suggesting different motivations for participation between the two programs.

AB BackgroundDental caries in the expanding elderly, predominantly-dentate population is an emerging public health concern. Elderly individuals with heavily restored dentitions represent a clinical challenge and significant financial burden for healthcare systems, especially when their physical and cognitive abilities are in decline. Prescription of higher concentration fluoride toothpaste to prevent caries in older populations is expanding in the UK, significantly increasing costs for the National Health Services (NHS) but the effectiveness and cost benefit of this intervention are uncertain. The Reflect trial will evaluate the effectiveness and cost benefit of General Dental Practitioner (GDP) prescribing of 5000ppm fluoride toothpaste and usual care compared to usual care alone in individuals 50years and over with high-risk of caries.Methods/designA pragmatic, open-label, randomised controlled trial involving adults aged 50years and above attending NHS dental practices identified by their dentist as having high risk of dental caries. Participants will be randomised to prescription of 5000ppm fluoride toothpaste (frequency, amount and duration decided by GDP) and usual care only. 1200 participants will be recruited from approximately 60 dental practices in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland and followed up for 3years. The primary outcome will be the proportion of participants receiving any dental treatment due to caries. Secondary outcomes will include coronal and root caries increments measured by independent, blinded examiners, patient reported quality of life measures, and economic outcomes; NHS and patient perspective costs, willingness to pay, net benefit (analysed over the trial follow-up period and modelled lifetime horizon). A parallel qualitative study will investigate GDPs' practises of and beliefs about prescribing the toothpaste and patients' beliefs and experiences of the toothpaste and perceived impacts on their oral health-related behaviours.DiscussionThe Reflect trial will provide valuable information to patients, policy makers and clinicians on the costs and benefits of an expensive, but evidence-deficient caries prevention intervention delivered to older adults in general dental practice.Trial registrationISRCTN: 2017-002402-13 registered 02/06/2017, first participant recruited 03/05/2018.Ethics Reference No: 17/NE/0329/233335.Funding Body: Health Technology Assessment funding stream of National Institute for Health Research.Funder number: HTA project 16/23/01.Trial Sponsor: Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford Road, Manchester, M13 9WL.The Trial was prospectively registered.

AB BackgroundNon-supine infant sleep position is an important modifiable risk factor for sudden unexpected death in infancy. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of supine sleep position and associated factors among 3-month-old infants from a birth cohort in the city of Pelotas, southern Brazil.MethodsThe present study evaluated longitudinal data from the 2015 Pelotas Birth Cohort. Study outcome was supine infant sleep position, defined as the appropriate position, among 3-month-old children. Demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral, and health characteristics collected at birth and at the 3-month follow-up were investigated as possible associated factors. The prevalence of each associated factor was investigated, and crude and hierarchical adjusted analyses were performed using Poisson regression.ResultsAmong the 4108 infants assessed in this study, 2274 (55.4%) slept in supine position at 3months and only 66 (1.6%) in prone position. Maternal white skin color, higher family income and maternal schooling, advanced maternal age, maternal cohabiting with a partner, receiving counseling from health care professionals and non-bed-sharing were associated with higher prevalence of infants sleeping in supine position at 3months. All these variables remained associated in our hierarchical adjusted analyses except maternal cohabitation with a partner. Participants with white mothers were more likely to sleep in supine position (PR: 1.23; 95%CI: 0.75-0.89) compared to participants with black mothers. Those belonging to the richest quintile were more likely to sleep in supine position (PR: 1.49; 95%CI: 1.35-1.65) compared to those who belong to the poorest. Mothers aged 31-36years were more likely to choose supine sleep position (PR: 1.65; 95%CI: 1.42-1.92) compared to mothers younger than 19years.ConclusionsThe findings of the present study showed the influence of maternal age, socioeconomic status, and counseling on infant sleep habits as predictors of choice of infant sleep position in a Brazilian population. It is recommended to implement informative campaigns and public policies to at-risk population and to improve recommendations from health care professionals.

AB BackgroundNeedlestick and sharp injuries (NSIs) are an important element of public health and should be closely monitored. On the other hand there are no precise Polish data on a number of the occupational NSIs. The aim of the study was to assess the failure to report injuries and then to estimate the actual number of NSIs among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Poland based on the collected data.MethodsAnalysis of injury registers on the basis of 252 hospitals in Poland. Conducting 487 surveys among doctors, nurses and paramedics. Calculation of rates of injuries per 1000 workers per year (with 95% confidence intervals (CI)). The level of statistical significance was set at p0.05.ResultsIn the study period, 9775 NSIs were registered in the hospitals. Majority of the NSIs were recorded among nurses (72.6%,p<0.01). The needle was the tool responsible for the greatest number of the NSIs in all professional groups (79.5%, p<0.01). The average annual NSIs rates based on hospital registers were: 16.0/1000 doctors, 20.5/1000 nurses, 16.8/1000 paramedics. Every second NSIs was not reported (45.2%). We estimated that there are probably 13,567 NSIs every year among hospital care workers in Poland.ConclusionsNSIs are a significant health problem for HCWs and should be subject to epidemiological surveillance. The purpose of the training of medical personnel should be to increase the number of injuries reported. The implementation of the epidemiological surveillance system will allow for the unification of the obtained data, which would be more comparable on the national scale as well as between different countries.

AB BackgroundUp to 80% of the adult homeless population use tobacco, and smoking cessation programs could offer an important opportunity to address preventable mortality and morbidity for this population. This population faces serious challenges to smoking cessation, including the impact of the social environment.MethodsForty participants (11 female; 29 male) from an ongoing smoking cessation randomized clinical trial conducted at 2 urban homeless shelters in the Upper Midwest were invited to take part in semi-structured interviews in 2016-2017. An interviewer used a semi-structured interview guide asking participants to describe their experience of how the social environment impacted their attempt to quit smoking.ResultsParticipants described feeling pressure to smoke and drink in and around shelters, and that this pressure had led some to start smoking or resume smoking, along with making it very challenging to quit. Participants described being motivated to quit, and seeing smoking cessation as positively impacting the time and focus they felt they had for finding housing. However many felt more interested in reducing their smoking, rather than quitting.ConclusionsAddressing smoking cessation for people experiencing homelessness is both an important public health opportunity, and a challenge. There is a need to consider cessation in the context of the social and environmental factors impacting smokers who are experiencing homelessness. In particular, there is a need to address the collective value placed on smoking in social interactions. Despite these challenges, there are high levels of motivation and interest in addressing smoking.Trial registrationNCT01932996. Date of registration 30th August 2013. Prospectively registered.

AB Providing the dairy industry with an effective and safe disinfectant is considered a key step in improving the farm hygiene and biosecurity. Salmonella infection via foodborne transmission remains a major public health threat. The main objective of this study was therefore to characterize and compare the decontamination power of NaOCl, aqueous-O-3, and PAA against cattle manure based-Salmonella heavily contaminated various surfaces (plastic, nylon, rubber, and wood) using Bayesian analysis. In a crossover design, 14 strips of each material were randomly assigned between 3 groups, treatment (n = 6), positive-control (contaminated with feces-Salmonella mixture, but not exposed to disinfectants, n = 6), and negative control (laboratory blank, inoculated only with sterile water, n = 2). The strips were soaked in cattle manure inoculated with 10(7)-10(8) of Salmonella Typhimurium-Choleraesuis (aSTC) and exposed to 50 mL of 200 ppm NaOCl, 9 ppm aqueous-O-3, or 400 ppm PAA for 4 minutes. Bayesian methods were used for analysis. On plastic and nylon surfaces, NaOCl, aqueous-O-3, or PAA reduce aSTC population to a safe level (>5.0-log(10)) within 4 minutes. On rubber surface, PAA and aqueous-O3 can produce a reduction in aSTC population 50% and 30% higher than NaOCl with posterior probabilities of 97% and 90%, respectively. However, PAA can produce reduction factor on wood surface 40% higher than aqueous-O-3 and NaOCl with posterior probabilities of 97% and 73%, respectively. We conclude that smooth surfaces were most effectively decontaminated. Peracetic acid of 400 ppm can provide an effective means for controlling Salmonella population heavily contaminated various surfaces in dairy operations. However, the safe residues and strong reactivity makes aqueous-O3 and PAA attractive alternative disinfectants for improving farm hygiene and biosecurity.

AB BackgroundThe Joint External Evaluation Process (JEE), developed in response to the 2014 Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), is a voluntary, independent process conducted by a team of external evaluators to assess a country's public health preparedness capabilities under the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR) revision. Feedback from the JEE process is intended to aid in the development of national action plans by elucidating weaknesses in current preparedness and response capabilities.MethodsTo identify gaps in sector participation and the development of national action plans in response to public health emergencies, all English-language JEE reports available on March 31, 2018 (N=47) were systematically reviewed to determine sectoral backgrounds of key host country participants.ResultsOverall, strong representation was seen in the health, agriculture, domestic security, and environment sectors, whereas the energy/nuclear and defense sectors were largely under-represented.ConclusionsWhile strong participation by more traditional sectors such as health and agriculture is common in the JEE development process, involvement by the defense and energy/nuclear sectors in the JEE process could be increased, potentially improving preparedness and response to widespread public health emergencies.

   PEOPLE; IGT
AB Background: Each year around 5-10% of people with non-diabetic hyperglycaemia will develop type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetes prevention is a national and global public health concern. Diabetes Prevention Programmes, which seek to identify at-risk individuals and support entry to health improvement initiatives, recognise that enhanced identification and referral of at-risk individuals is required within primary care and beyond, through community-focused prevention approaches. We report an evaluation of a demonstrator site for the NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme in the UK, which piloted an enhanced Primary Care referral programme (sampling from patients identified as at-risk from general practice databases) and a Community identification programme (sampling from the general population through opportunistic identification in community locations) in an effort to maximise participation in prevention services.
   Methods: We used mixed-methods evaluation to assess the impact of the two referral routes on participation in the Diabetes Prevention Programmes in line with the RE-AIM Framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance). Individual level patient data was descriptively analysed to assess identifications and eligible referrals made in each route. Semi-structured interviews conducted with referral staff and key stakeholders were analysed using thematic analysis and informed by Normalisation Process Theory.
   Results: The nurse facilitated primary care referral route provided 88% of all referrals to the telephone DPP, compared to the community referral route which provided 5%, and the proportion joining the programme was higher among primary care referrals (45%) than community referrals (22%), and retention rates were higher (73% compared to 50%). The nurse-facilitated route integrated more easily into existing clinical processes. The community programme was impeded by a lack of collaborative inter-agency working which obscured the intended focus on high-risk populations despite conversion rates (numbers identified at risk who entered prevention programmes) being highest in areas of high deprivation.
   Conclusions: The study demonstrates the interaction of components, with effective Adoption and Implementation necessary to support Reach. The NPT analysis demonstrated the importance of consensus around not only the need for such programmes but agreement on how they can be delivered. Future programmes should support inter-agency communication and collaboration, and focus identification efforts on areas of high-risk.

AB Background: Health management information systems (HMIS) are instrumental in addressing health delivery problems and strengthening health sectors by generating credible evidence about the health status of clients. There is paucity of studies which have explored possibilities for integrating family planning data from the public and private health sectors in Uganda's national HMIS. This study sought to investigate the facilitators, best practices and barriers of integrating family planning data into the district and national HMIS in Uganda.
   Methods: We conducted a qualitative study in Kampala, Jinja, and Hoima Districts of Uganda, based on 16 key informant interviews and a multi-stakeholder dialogue workshop with 11 participants. Deductive and inductive thematic methods were used to analyze the data.
   Results: The technical facilitators of integrating family planning data from public and private facilities in the national and district HMIS were user-friendly software; web-based and integrated reporting; and availability of resources, including computers. Organizational facilitators included prioritizing family planning data; training staff; supportive supervision; and quarterly performance review meetings. Key behavioral facilitators were motivation and competence of staff. Collaborative networks with implementing partners were also found to be essential for improving performance and sustainability. Significant technical barriers included limited supply of computers in lower level health facilities, complex forms, double and therefore tedious entry of data, and web-reporting challenges. Organizational barriers included limited human resources; high levels of staff attrition in private facilities; inadequate training in data collection and use; poor culture of information use; and frequent stock outs of paper-based forms. Behavioral barriers were low use of family planning data for planning purposes by district and health facility staff.
   Conclusion: Family planning data collection and reporting are integrated in Uganda's district and national HMIS. Best practices included integrated reporting and performance review, among others. Limited priority and attention is given to family planning data collection at the facility and national levels. Data are not used by the health facilities that collect them. We recommend reviewing and tailoring data collection forms and ensuring their availability at health facilities. All staff involved in data reporting should be trained and regularly supervised.

AB Background: Rotavirus gastroenteritis is a major public health problem in Nepal. This study was conducted to obtain information associated with Rotavirus gastroenteritis and to perform genotyping of Rotavirus A.
   Methods; Hospital based cross sectional study was conducted from January to December 2017 among children less than 5years of age attending Kanti Children's Hospital and Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital. Rotavirus A antigen detection was performed by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) using ProSpecT Rotavirus Microplate Assay. Rotavirus A positive strains were further confirmed by genotyping using Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).
   Results: A total of 1074 stool samples were collected, of them 770 were hospitalized, and 304 were non-hospitalized cases. Rotavirus A infection was found in 28% of children with infection rate higher in hospitalized (34%) than in non-hospitalized (14%) children. Rotavirus A detection was higher in male (31%) than in female (24%), but this was statistically not significant (p > 0.05). Rotavirus A positivity was higher in children of age group 0-23months, this result was statistically not significant (p > 0.05) with higher frequency found in the months of November, December, January, February and March (p < 0.05). On the basis of molecular analysis of Rotavirus A genotyping, G12P[6] (46.39%) was found to be the predominant followed by G1P[8] (35.05%), G3P[8] (7.21%) and G1P[6] (5.15%) while 4.12% was mixed infection and 1.03% was partially typed (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Rotavirus A infection occurred throughout the year, but the infection was significantly higher during the month of March. The higher frequency of rotavirus infection was observed among children of age group 0-23months; however this was not found to be statistically significant. In this study, G12P[6] is predominant genotype observed. The results of genotyping are essential for the introduction of Rotavirus vaccine in Nepal.

AB Background: There has been an exponential increase in the offering of short-term international field experiences in recent years in response to student demands for global health opportunities. Pre-departure preparation is an essential component to equip trainees with the adequate safety, wellness, and cultural competence needed to engage in a meaningful and mutually beneficial elective. This review seeks to quantify the plethora of pre-departure preparation training available to public health, clinical, and undergraduate trainees across the continuum of education for short-term experiences in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs).
   Methods: We performed a systematic review of Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Ovid Global Health in February, 2018. A three-concept search was employed and included "global or international health"; "education or preparation of personnel/students"; and "field programs or travel." The study teamed used PRISMA reporting guidelines to conduct title and full-text reviews and conduct data extraction and analysis.
   Results: The search returned 2506 unique articles. Of these, 55 met inclusion criteria and were included in the final review. Ninety one percent (91%) of articles focused on pre-departure trainings for medical students and residents. Nine thematic domains for short-term international field experiences emerged; culture, safety, and project-specific knowledge were the most frequently covered domains while mentorship, professionalism, and emotional wellness and culture shock were least common. Approximately half (53.3%) of studies specifically evaluated the pre-departure component of the international experience using a survey or evaluation form. Recommendations emerged from these evaluations including early engagement with international partners, inclusion of self-reflection exercises and site-specific content, and utilization of interactive approaches in learning. Some institutions face barriers to conducting pre-departure preparation such as lack of dedicated faculty, finances, and institutional support.
   Conclusions: Interest in pre-departure training for international experiences is growing but few programs conduct and publish evaluations of these trainings. Pre-departure trainings should be developed in partnership with receiving institutions and faculty and incorporate critical self-reflection throughout the experience. In addition to the experience itself, institutions need to evaluate these curricula to better understand how they influence trainees' capacity to effectively engage in LMIC settings.

AB BackgroundVitamin D deficiency (VDD) is a common problem in reproductive-aged women and has become a major public health problem worldwide. The effect of VDD in pregnancy has been associated with several adverse pregnancy outcomes. This study aims to assess the serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in the first trimester and its associated factors (socio-demographics, pregnancy profiles, dietary intake, and maternal anthropometry measurements) for the determination of vitamin D deficiency status in early pregnancy.MethodsA cross-sectional study of 239 pregnant mothers in West Sumatra, Indonesia was conducted. We measured lifestyle, socio-demographics and pregnancy profile through a structured questionnaire and interview process. A semi quantitative-food frequency questionnaire (SQ-FFQ) was used to analyse the dietary intake of the pregnant women. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were measured at <13weeks gestation using ELISA and logistic regression models were employed to identify the predictors of low vitamin D status.ResultsThe prevalence of first-trimester maternal VDD and sufficiency were 82.8 and 17.2% respectively. The median 25(OH)D was 13.15ng/mL (3.00-49.29ng/mL). The significant independent predictors were no working status (OR: 0.029;0.001-0.708) (p=0.030); nulliparous parity status (OR: 7.634;1.550-37.608) (p=0.012); length of outdoor activity status of less than an hour (OR: 9.659;1.883-49.550) (p=0.007); and no consumption of supplements before pregnancy (OR: 4.49;1.081-18.563) (p=0.039).ConclusionsThe prevalence of VDD is common in early pregnancy among Minangkabau women. Recommendations and policies to detect and prevent such insufficiency during pregnancy should be developed by considering the associated factors.

AB BackgroundLeishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by a protozoan of the Leishmania genus, and is considered a neglected tropical disease. It still remains a main public health concern at global level and in Arab world mainly in low-income countries. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the Arab world's growing contribution to global leishmaniasis research.MethodsThis study describes a bibliometric review of all leishmaniasis research publications published between January 1998 and December 2017 indexed on the Scopus database.ResultsThe total number of publications published at global level was 17,570 papers, which achieves an average annual productivity of 878.50 papers publications. Brazil was responsible for the greatest output with the total number of publications of 3865 followed by the Unites States (n=2729), India (n=2119), the United Kingdom (n=1363), and Spain (n=1274). By limiting the analysis to the publications that have been published by Arab world, the research productivity was 993 papers, which represents 5.65% of total research output at global level in research regarding leishmaniasis. Tunisia was responsible for the greatest output from Arab world with the total number of publications of 297 followed by Sudan (n=192), Saudi Arabia (n=131), Morocco (n=119) and Egypt (n=67). Since 1998, the growth of publications on leishmaniasis fluctuates, overall showing a rising trend in both global and Arab world. There is a highly significant correlation between publication productivity related to leishmaniasis at global level and the Arab world (r=0.936; p-value<0.001). Leishmaniasis treatment, intracellular mechanism of infection, and lifecycle of leishmania are the major current hot topics for the research in this subject at global level and the Arab world.ConclusionsThe current study presents a novel review of the current Arab leishmaniasis-related research, and how these results are related to worldwide output. In comparison to the global research output, the Arab world produced less leishmaniasis research. The data presented in the current study by this innovative approach may serve relevant researchers to direct the global leishmaniasis research to Arab counties in which leishmaniasis is endemic.

AB BackgroundArea-level measures of socioeconomic deprivation are important for understanding and describing health inequalities. The aim of this study was the development and validation of a small-area index of socioeconomic deprivation for Cypriot communities and the investigation of its association with the spatial distribution of all-cause premature adult mortality.MethodsSix area-level socioeconomic indicators were used from the 2011 national population census (low educational attainment, unemployment, not owner occupied household, single-person household, divorced or widowed and single-parent households). After normalization and standardization of the geographically smoothed indicators, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to construct indicator weights. The association between deprivation indices and the spatial distribution of all-cause premature adult mortality was estimated in Poisson log-linear spatial models.ResultsPCA resulted in two principal components explaining the 65.7% of the total variance. The first principal component included four indicators (low educational attainment, single-person households, divorced or widowed and single-parent households, the latter however with a negative loading) and it thought more likely to capture rural-related aspects of deprivation. The second principal component included the other two indicators (unemployment and not owner occupied households) and it is more likely to capture urban-related aspects of material deprivation. Restricting the analysis in the metropolitan areas of the island resulted in a different set of indicators for the urban-specific deprivation index. All developed indices were linearly associated with all-cause premature adult mortality. The all-cause premature adult mortality increased by 17% per 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in rural-related socioeconomic deprivation (95% CrI: 8-27%) and 8% per 1 SD increase in urban-related aspects of material deprivation (95% CrI: 3-15%) in the nationwide analysis and 9% per 1 SD increase in urban-specific socioeconomic deprivation (95% CrI: 4-15%) across metropolitan areas.ConclusionsThe results of this study demonstrate that a set of small-area indices of socioeconomic deprivation across Cypriot communities have good construct and predictive validity. However, the study indicates that different aspects of socioeconomic deprivation may be important in rural and urban areas in Cyprus. The developed socioeconomic deprivation indices could offer a valid new tool for Cypriot public health research and policy in terms of identifying areas in greatest need, guiding resource allocation and developing area-targeted public health programmes and policies.

AB BackgroundThe Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy implemented by the World Health Organization (WHO) in Africa has produced a large amount of data on participating countries, and in particular on the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). These data are increasingly considered as unevaluable and, therefore, as requiring a rigorous process of validation before they can be used for research or public health purposes. The aim of this study was to propose a method to assess the level of adequacy of IDSR morbidity data in reflecting actual morbidity.MethodsA systematic search of English- and French-language articles was performed in Scopus, Medline, Science Direct, Springer Link, Cochrane, Cairn, Persee, and Erudit databases. Other types of documents were identified through manual searches. Selected articles focused on the determinants of the discrepancies (differences) between reported morbidity and actual morbidity. An adequacy score was constructed using some of the identified determinants. This score was applied to the 15 weekly reported diseases monitored by IDSR surveillance in the DRC. A classification was established using the Jenks method and a sensitivity analysis was performed. Twenty-three classes of determinants were identified in 35 IDSR technical guides and reports of outbreak investigations and in 71 out of 2254 researched articles. For each of the 15 weekly reported diseases, the SIA was composed of 12 items grouped in 6 dimensions.ResultsThe SIA classified the 15 weekly reported diseases into 3 categories or types: high score or good adequacy (value >=14), moderate score or fair adequacy (value >=8 and<14), and low score or low or non-adequacy (value <8). Regardless of the criteria used in the sensitivity analysis, there was no notable variation in SIA values or categories for any of the 15 weekly reported diseases.ConclusionIn a context of sparse health information in low- and middle-income countries, this study developed a score to help classify IDSR morbidity data as usable, usable after adjustment, or unusable. This score can serve to prioritize, optimize, and interpret data analyses for epidemiological research or public health purposes.

AB BackgroundThere has been growing global concern about air pollution due to its great risk to public health. In Japan, although industrial- and traffic-related air pollution has been decreasing, concerns about particulate matter air pollution has been growing in recent years. In this study, we examined the effects of air pollution on symptoms and the health status of healthy subjects in Japan.MethodsParticipants (n=2887) who visited healthcare centers in Kumamoto or Niigata prefectures in February from 2010 to 2015 were asked to fill out a questionnaire, which was a self-completed booklet containing questions on the characteristics of participants, their respiratory symptoms, and questionnaires on their health status in February, May, and July. Generalized estimating equation analyses were performed to predict the factors associated with the symptoms and health status using two-week averages of air quality parameters obtained from 49 monitoring stations as independent variables.ResultsOnly allergy was associated with air quality in both areas. Prevalence of the other respiratory symptoms were correlated with air quality only in Kumamoto. The health statuses including the physical fitness', daily activities', and social activities' domains were related only to time spent outdoors. The overall health' was associated with time spent outdoors and concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and suspended particulate matters (SPM) in Kumamoto, and with temperatures and SPM in Niigata. The pain' score was correlated with temperature and carbon monoxide concentration only in Kumamoto. In Kumamoto, the quality of life (QoL)' was worse in those who spent shorter hours outdoors, were exposed to lower humidity, higher concentrations of oxidants, SPM, and PM2.5, and who experienced more Asian sand dust (ASD) events. In Niigata, a worsened QoL' was associated with time spent outdoors, temperature, and SPM.ConclusionsThe associations between air quality and the health status was found mainly in the comprehensive domain of the health status such as overall health' and QoL'. The effect of short-term exposure to larger particles, such as SPM, on health status was observed when compared to smaller particles such as PM2.5 and gaseous pollutants.

ID MALNUTRITION
AB BackgroundStunting is an indicator of the devastating result of malnutrition in early childhood. The effects of childhood stunting are irreparable physical and cognitive harm. It is an issue of the great public health importance throughout Sub-Saharan African countries including Ethiopia. Therefore, identification of the risk factors of child stunting from recent data is very important for timely intervention.MethodsThe 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey data were used for this study. A generalized linear mixed model which is an extension of the general linear model was employed to identify socioeconomic, demographic, environmental and health related risk factors for stunted under-five children.ResultsThe result shows that the age and sex of the child, preceding birth interval, mother's body mass index, household wealth index, mother's education level, breastfeeding period, type of toilet facility, use of internet and source of drinking water were the major determinants of stunting of under-five children in Ethiopia.ConclusionThe study indicated that children from undernourished mothers, who are not breastfeeding, from poor households, households that have no toilet facilities, who are male, older age (between 12 to 59months), who have illiterate mother and short birth spacing were associated with stunting problems. Therefore, family planning education and policy is required for the country to improve on under-five age stunting problems.

DE Veterinary public health; Present status; Constraints; Future plans;
   Bangladesh
AB Background: Veterinary Public Health (VPH) is a major part of public health in which human health and well-being are the central tasks. In recent years the VPH is gaining increasing importance because immense changes have occurred in animal production processes and agricultural structures. The aim of this paper is to describe the current VPH activities in Bangladesh, its major constraints and future activities plan to ensure safe food production as well as protect the environment and public health.
   Main text: VPH concerns all areas of food production and safety, zoonosis control, environmental protection and animal welfare. In Bangladesh, the VPH unit was established in 1984 by the Directorate of Livestock Services (DLS) for zoonosis control and production of wholesome food of animal origin. Zoonoses are the core domain of VPH. Bangladesh is facing the emergence of zoonotic diseases including anthrax, tuberculosis, brucellosis, salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, E. coli infections, avian influenza, rabies, nipah and dengue virus infections.. Multi-drug resistance bacteria are emerging due to indiscriminate uses of antibiotics in livestock and poultry industries. Lack of proper slaughter houses, antemortem and postmortem inspections of carcasses by qualified veterinarians contributes greatly to unwholesome meat production. The VPH unit has a significant role to play to ensure better public health. However, there are many constraints that affect the VPH services. Absence of VPH services at all administrative level, inadequate budget, lack of qualified personnel, poor lab facilities, absence of legal framework, and the lack of coordination with health department are the major constraints.
   Conclusions: The spectrum of VPH issues in Bangladesh is very large. Therefore it is important to carefully set priorities in order to ensure effective and efficient VPH services. Establishment of VPH units at all levels, effective surveillance for zoonotic diseases, institution of legal framework to define role of VPH services, creation of public health awareness, collaborative works with health departments, improving laboratory facilities and training programs for the veterinarian are keys to ensure better VPH services in Bangladesh.

AB We thank Daly-Smith et al. for taking the time to read the results of our pilot research study, describing it as an important and welcome contribution. Nonetheless, the authors argue six points against our conclusion. We contend that we addressed three of these points in our original discussion and disagree with their remaining points. Overall, their Commentary adds little to the topic of research into the Daily Mile that we had not already raised in our discussion. Additionally, they attribute statements to us that we did not make and ignore the raising of key issues in our original article. Given this, we stand by our original peer-reviewed conclusion that introducing the Daily Mile to the primary school day appears to be an effective intervention for increasing levels of moderate to vigorous physical activity, reducing sedentary time, increasing physical fitness and improving body composition, and that these findings have relevance for teachers, policy-makers, public health practitioners and health researchers.

AB Background: School neighborhood food environment is recognized as an important contributor to childhood obesity; however, large-scale and longitudinal studies remain limited. This study aimed to examine this association and its variation across gender and urbanicity at multiple geographic scales.
   Methods: We used the US nationally representative Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten cohort data and included 7530 kindergarteners followed up from 1998 to 2007. The Census, road network, and Dun and Bradstreet commercial datasets were used to construct time-varying measurements of 11 types of food outlet within 800-m straight-line and road-network buffer zones of schools and school ZIP codes, including supermarket, convenience store, full-service restaurant, fast-food restaurant, retail bakery, dairy product store, health/dietetic food store, candy store, fruit/vegetable market, meat/fish market, and beverage store. Two-level mixed-effect and cluster-robust logistic regression models were performed to examine the association.
   Results: A higher body mass index (BMI) in 2007 was observed among children experiencing an increase of convenience stores in school neighborhoods during 1998-2007 (beta=0.39, p<0.05), especially among girls (beta=0.50) and urban schoolchildren (beta=0.41), as well as among children with a decrease of dairy product stores (beta=0.39, p<0.05), especially among boys (beta=1.86) and urban schoolchildren (beta=0.92). The higher obesity risk was associated with the increase of fast-food restaurants in urban schoolchildren (OR=1.27 [95% CI=1.02-1.59]) and of convenience stores in girls (OR=1.41 [95% CI=1.09-1.82]) and non-urban schoolchildren (OR=1.60 [95% CI=1.10-2.33]). The increase of full-service restaurants was related to lower obesity risk in boys (OR=0.74 [95% CI=0.57-0.95]). The decrease of dairy product stores was associated with the higher obesity risk (OR=1.68 [95% CI=1.07-2.65]), especially boys (OR=2.92 [95% CI=1.58-5.40]) and urban schoolchildren (OR=1.67 [95% CI=1.07-2.61]). The schoolchildren exposed to the decrease of meat/fish markets showed the lower obesity risk (OR=0.57 [95% CI=0.35-0.91]), especially urban schoolchildren (OR=0.53 [95% CI=0.32-0.87]). Results from analyses within 800-m straight-line buffer zones of schools were more consistent with our theory-based hypotheses than those from analyses within 800-m road-network buffer zones of schools and school ZIP codes.
   Conclusions: National data in the USA suggest that long-term exposure to the food environment around schools could affect childhood obesity risk; this association varied across gender and urbanicity. This study has important public health implications for future school-based dietary intervention design and urban planning.

SO BMC PHARMACOLOGY & TOXICOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Acute toxicology; Immunoassay; Dichlorvos; Chlorpyrifos; Cypermethrin
AB Background: Experimental pharmacology deals with effects of various test substances studied on different animal species which is aimed at finding out safe therapeutic agent suitable for public health as well as mechanism and site of action of a test substance. It is the basic step in the discovery of new drugs or studying the pharmacological actions of already developed one using both preclinical and clinical study designs in a stepwise phase of investigations. However, the investigations in the first phase of experimental pharmacology are usually concluded with assumption hypothesis without any adequate validation of the scientific evidence. Single dose acute toxicology had been conducted on Balb c mice with three different level of doses prepared from each of three different test chemicals (Dichlorvos, Chlorpyrifos and Cypermethrin) with known median lethal dose (LD50) to define the fundamental principles, cause of toxicity and investigation timeframe in the first phase of experimental pharmacology.
   Methods: The methods used for data collection were: procurement of test chemicals, investigation of single dose acute toxicity on Balb c mice and quantitative immunoglobulins test. Data was thematically compiled for validation of the findings from each of the sources.
   Results: The result showed that the dose had never limited the toxic property of tested chemicals but the magnitude of adverse effect and length of time at which adverse effect was manifested on treated Balb c mice. The toxicity of tested chemicals was however limited by the toxic reaction rate of a dose in the biological process of exposed Balb c mice. The toxic effect of tested chemicals became magnified within a short period of time when large amount administered orally. It also remained after a long period of time when small amount administered in the same route.
   Conclusion: Adequate investigation time for acute toxicity study was therefore essential for comprehensive analysis of pharmacological property of tested chemicals at different level of doses.

AB Human mobility in urban environments is a central part of urbanization and has determined the layout of how cities are projected, built and renovated. One of the most problematic issues of urbanization is how to properly dispose of used tires, considering the worldwide annual production of approximately 1.4 billion units every year. Despite the efforts to properly dispose of used tires, they still represent a major problem for public health, notably serving as potential breeding sites for vector mosquitoes. Miami-Dade County, Florida has been suffering from arbovirus outbreaks for decades, including dengue, West Nile and yellow fever viruses. The objective of this study was to survey tire shops inserted in the urban matrix across Miami-Dade County for the presence of vector mosquitoes. This study used a cross-sectional design to survey the production of vector mosquitoes at 12 tires shops. Mosquitoes were found in all but one of the tires shops surveyed. We collected a total of 1,110 mosquitoes comprising 528 adults and 582 immatures. Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus were abundantly found in both their immature and adult forms, constituting 99.99% of the mosquito samples collected. Aedes aegypti was the most abundant species recorded displaying the highest values in the Shannon and Simpson indices. The findings of this study demonstrate that vector mosquitoes, primarily Ae. aegypti, are being produced in tires shops in Miami indicating these habitats are highly favorable breeding environments for the production of vector mosquitoes and emphasizing the need to address how the abundance and presence of mosquitoes may vary seasonally in these environments.

AB BackgroundHepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major public health burden in China although it has steadily declined over the last two decades. A valid updated prevalence of HBV infection in China relies on a large sample size. Hence this study aimed to estimate HBV seroprevalence using a large inpatient population in Northeast China.MethodsWe consecutively enrolled 218,627 inpatients aged 1-70years admitted to the First Hospital of Jilin University from January 2010 through December 2014. HBV serological markers were detected by chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA).ResultsAmong the 218,627 collected samples, 16,254 (7.43%) were positive for HBsAg and 41.64% of patients were negative for all the HBV markers. The highest HBsAg prevalence was 10.05% in the 41-50year age group and the lowest were 0.47% in the 1-10 and 2.35% in the 11-20year age groups, respectively. HBsAg positivity was higher in males compared to females (8.94% vs. 5.80%). An HBsAg positivity of nearly 14% was found in middle-aged males, and positivity was 6.2% in females of childbearing age. One-third of this population only had a single HBsAb marker, which was also detected in 60% of patients aged under 20years.ConclusionThough universal hepatitis B vaccination of infants has significantly reduced HBsAg prevalence in children, the number of most adults who have been infected with HBV remains steady. Extra care and resources should be provided to HBV-infected middle-aged males to stop the progression of chronic hepatitis B, and HBsAg positive females of childbearing age to block vertical HBV transmission.

AB BackgroundGauging medical education quality has always remained challenging. Many studies have examined predictors of standardized exam performance; however, data sets do not distinguish by institution or curriculum. Our objective is to present a summary of variables associated with the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) scores, and thus identify institutions (and therefore curriculums) which deviate from trend lines by producing higher USMLE scores despite having lower entrance grade point averages and medical college admissions test (MCAT) scores.MethodsData was obtained from U.S. News and World Report's 2014 evaluation of allopathic U.S. medical schools. A univariate analysis was performed first for each variable using two sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test for categorical variables, and Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients for continuous variables. A multivariable linear regression model was developed to identify the factors contributing to USMLE scores. All statistical analyses were two-sided and performed using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).ResultsUnivariate analysis reveals a significant association between USMLE Step 1 and 2 scores with medical college admissions test scores, grade point averages, school type (private vs. public), full-time faculty-to-student ratio, National Institute of Health funds, residency director assessment score, peer assessment score, and class size. Of these nine variables, MCAT scores and Step 1 scores display the strongest correlation (corr=0.72, P<.0001). Multivariable analysis also supports a significant association between MCAT scores and Step scores, meanwhile National Institute of Health funding size demonstrates a negative correlation with USMLE Step 2 scores. Although MCAT scores and National Institute of Health funds are significantly associated with USMLE performance, six outlier institutions were identified, producing higher USMLE scores than trend line predictions.ConclusionsOutlier institutions produce USMLE scores that do not follow expected trend lines. Their performance might be explainable by differences in curriculum. Having identified these institutions, their curriculums can be further studied to determine what factors enhance student learning.

AB BackgroundPatients undergoing major cancer surgery frequently require post-acute care for complications and adverse effects. Enhanced recovery after surgery programmes mean that patients are increasingly discharged home earlier. Symptom/complication detection post-discharge is sub-optimal. Systematic patient monitoring post-discharge following surgery may be optimally achieved through routine electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) data capture. ePRO systems that employ clinical algorithms to guide management of patients and automatically alert clinicians of clinically-concerning symptoms can improve patient outcomes and decrease hospital admissions. ePRO systems that provide individually-tailored self-management advice and integrate live ePRO data into electronic health records (EHR) may also advance personalised health and patient-centred care. This study aims to develop a hospital EHR-integrated ePRO system to improve detection and management of complications post-discharge following cancer-related surgery.MethodsThe ePRO system was developed in two phases: (1) Development of a web-based ePRO symptom-report from validated European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) questionnaires, clinical opinion and patient interviews, followed by hospital EHR integration; (2) Development of clinical algorithms triggering symptom severity-dependent patient advice and clinician alerts from: (i) prospectively-collected patient-completed ePRO symptom-report data; (ii) stakeholder meetings; (iii) patient interviews. Patient advice was developed from: (i) clinician-patient telephone consultations and patient interviews; (ii) review of hospital patient information leaflets (PIL) and patient support websites.ResultsPhase 1, including interviews with 18 patients, identified 35 symptom-report items. In phase 2, 130/300 (43%) screened patients were eligible. 61 (47%) consented to participate and 59 (97%) provided 444 complete self-reports. Stakeholder meetings (9 clinicians, 1 patient/public representative) and patient interviews (n=66) refined advice/alert accuracy. 15 telephone consultations, 7 patient interviews and review of 28 PILs and 3 patient support websites identified 4 themes to inform self-management advice. Comparisons between ePRO symptom-report data, telephone consultations and clinical events/outcomes (n=27 patients) further refined clinical algorithms.ConclusionsA hospital EHR-integrated ePRO system that alerts clinicians and provides patient self-management advice has been developed to improve the detection and management of problems and complications after discharge following surgery. An ongoing pilot study will inform a multicentre randomised trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the ePRO system compared to usual care.

AB BackgroundBreast cancer screening mammography is widespread in industrialised countries within the framework of public health program or opportunist form. Only few data exist on the comparison of effectiveness between organised and opportunistic screening. The aim of this study is to compare organised and opportunistic screening using population-based data from the Fribourg cancer registry, Switzerland.MethodsWe included all first primary breast adenocarcinoma diagnosed between 2006 and 2014 in women aged 50-69years resident in the canton of Fribourg. We considered only breast cancer discovered by mammography screening. We compared patients, tumour characteristics and treatment modalities between breast cancer detected by the organised screening program versus opportunistic screening using logistic regression.ResultsOut of 989 patients diagnosed with breast cancer, 402 (40.6%) were diagnosed by organised and 205 (20.7%) by opportunistic screening. Women with breast cancer detected within the screening program were more likely to be from rural areas (P=0.035) and lived less frequently in high favoured regions (P=0.020). They presented more frequently in situ than invasive cancer (P=0.022). For patients with invasive breast cancer, those detected by the program were less likely to undergo mastectomy (P=0.06) and consequently, they were more likely to undergo radiation therapy (P=0.003). Adjustment for area of residence and financial context of the region did not modify the results presented.ConclusionsThe present study reports an increased rate of detection of carcinoma in situ in organised screening program as compared to opportunistic screening mammographies, an indirect evidence of a higher radiologic sensitivity. Furthermore, the results show a trend towards more mastectomies among patients with breast cancer discovered after opportunistic than after organized mammography screening, reflecting lower treatment burden. Those results were independent of socio-economic factors which differed across screening groups.

AB BackgroundFour species within Anaplasma genus are emerging zoonotic pathogens, which are transmitted by ticks and generate veterinary and public health concerns. Here, we performed a molecular survey of Anaplasma in Ankang, Northwest China.MethodsHard ticks were collected and identified using morphological and molecular methods. Human-pathogenic Anaplasma species were tested using nested polymerase chain reaction. The nearly complete rrs, gltA, and groEL genes sequences from revealed Anaplasma species were amplified and sequenced to determine their molecular characteristics and their phylogeny.ResultsAll ticks collected in Ankang belonged to the Rhipicephalus microplus. Novel unclassified Anaplasma strains genetically related to A. platys and A. capra were detected in these ticks. Co-infection of these two organisms was also found. The novel unclassified Anaplasma strains identified in this study formed a distinct phylogenetic lineage based on the groEL gene and two lineages based on the gltA gene within A. platys and related strains group. The revealed A. capra strains identified in this study were most closely related to those detected in humans and other vertebrate animals.ConclusionWe revealed the presence of A. capra, a novel human pathogens in R. microplus ticks in previously unrecognized endemic regions. We also detected a novel unclassified Anaplasma species genetically related to A. platys. The epidemiology of anaplasmosis caused by these two Anaplasma species in humans should be assessed in future studies.

AB BackgroundOnchocerciasis is a neglected tropical disease which is still of immense major public health concern in several areas of Africa and the Americas. The disease manifests either as ocular or as dermal onchocerciasis with several symptoms including itching, nodules, skin thickening, visual impairment and blindness. Ivermectin has been an efficient microfilaricide against the causative agent of the disease (Onchocerca volvulus) but reports from some areas in Africa suggest the development of resistance to this drug. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of onchocerciasis and associated clinical conditions frequently associated with the disease in three endemic communities in Ghana which have been subjected to 18 to 20 rounds of mass drug administration of ivermectin. This was to help determine whether or not onchocerciasis persists in these communities.MethodsA cross-sectional study design was adopted. Three communities (Tanfiano, Senya and Kokompe) in the Nkoranza North District of Ghana where mass drug administration of ivermectin had been ongoing for more than two decades were selected for the study. The population was randomly sampled and 114 participants recruited for the study based on the eligibility criteria. The study participants were examined for the presence of parasites and clinical manifestations of onchocerciasis following established protocols.ResultsThe study showed that the prevalence of microfilaria in the Tanfiano, Senya, Kokompe communities were 13.2, 2.4, and 2.9%, with nodule prevalence being 5.3, 4.9 and 14.3% respectively. Females in the study communities had a higher prevalence of microfilaria carriers (5.17%) relative to males (2.44%), but this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.2800, unpaired t test). The most frequent clinical manifestation observed in this study among all participants was dermatitis (25.4%), followed by visual impairment & nodules (7.9% each) and then by blindness (4.4%).ConclusionThe study showed that despite several years of mass drug administration with ivermectin, infection with onchocerciasis and the commonly associated clinical manifestations of the disease still persist in the study communities. This calls for a greater urgency for research and development aimed at discovering new or repurposed anti-filarial agents which will augment ivermectin if global onchocerciasis eradication targets are to be achieved.

AB BackgroundWorldwide, approximately 800,000 persons die by suicide every year; with rates of suicide attempts estimated to be much higher. Suicidal persons often suffer from a mental disorder but stigma, lack of available and suitable support, and insufficient information on mental health limit help seeking. The use of internet-based applications can help individuals inform themselves about mental disorders, assess the extent of their own concerns, find local treatment options, and prepare for contact with health care professionals. This project aims to develop and evaluate e-mental health interventions to improve knowledge about suicidality and to reduce stigmatization of those affected. In developing these interventions, a representative telephone survey was conducted to detect knowledge gaps and stigmatizing attitudes in the general population.MethodsFirst, a national representative telephone survey with N=2000 participants in Germany was conducted. Second, e-mental health interventions are developed to address knowledge gaps and public stigma detected in the survey. These comprise an evidence-based health information package about suicidality, information on regional support services, a self-administered depression testincluding suicidalityand an interactive online intervention including personal stories. The development is based on a trialogical exchange of experience between persons affected by suicidality, relatives of affected persons, and clinical experts. Australian researchers who developed an e-mental health intervention for individuals affected by rural suicide were invited to a workshop in order to contribute their knowledge and expertise. Third, the online intervention will be evaluated by a mixed methods design.DiscussionFrom representative telephone survey data, content can be developed to address specific attitudes and knowledge via the e-mental health interventions. These interventions will be easily accessed and provide an opportunity to reach people who tend not to seek professional services, prefer to inform themselves in advance and/or wish to remain anonymous. Evaluation of the online intervention will provide information on any changes in participants' self-stigma and perceived-stigma of suicidality, and any increase in participants' knowledge on suicidality or self-efficacy expectations.Trial registrationGerman Clinical Trial Register DRKS00015071 on August 6, 2018.

AB BackgroundIntimate partner violence (IPV), HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STI) can contribute to disparities in population health, depending on the individual, social and environmental factors characterizing a setting. To better understand the place-based determinants and patterns of these key interrelated public health problems in Uganda, we compared risk factors for IPV, HIV and STI in fishing, trading and agrarian communities in Rakai, Uganda by gender.MethodThis study used cross-sectional data collected from 14,464 sexually active men (n=6531) and women (n=7933) as part of the Rakai Community Cohort Study, a population-based open cohort study of men and women aged 15-49years. We used multilevel modified poisson regression models, which incorporated random intercepts for community and households. Factors associated with IPV, HIV and STI were assessed separately for men and women in fishing, trading and agrarian communities.ResultsA larger proportion of participants in the fishing communities than those in trading and agrarian communities were HIV positive, engaged in HIV risk behaviors, had STI symptoms and reported perpetration of or victimization by IPV. Female gender was a shared correlate of IPV, HIV and STI in the fishing communities. Engagement in multiple sexual relationships or partner's engagement in multiple relationships were shared correlates of IPV, and HIV in agrarian communities and IPV and STI in trading communities.ConclusionPrograms should target factors at multiple levels to reduce risk for syndemic conditions of HIV, STI and IPV in Rakai, Uganda particularly among men and women in fishing communities.

AB Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and plasmid mediated AmpC-type cephalosporinase (pAmpC)-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL/pAmpC E. coli) in food-producing animals is a major public health concern. This study aimed at quantifying ESBL/pAmpC-E. coli occurrence and transfer in Italy's broiler production pyramid. Three production chains of an integrated broiler company were investigated. Cloacal swabs were taken from parent stock chickens and offspring broiler flocks in four fattening farms per chain. Carcasses from sampled broiler flocks were collected at slaughterhouse. Samples were processed on selective media, and E. coli colonies were screened for ESBL/pAmpC production. ESBL/pAmpC genes and E. coli phylogroups were determined by PCR and sequencing. Average pairwise overlap of ESBL/pAmpC E. coli gene and phylogroup occurrences between subsequent production stages was estimated using the proportional similarity index, modelling uncertainty in a Monte Carlo simulation setting. In total, 820 samples were processed, from which 513 ESBL/pAmpC E. coli isolates were obtained. We found a high prevalence (92.5%, 95% CI 72.1-98.3%) in day-old parent stock chicks, in which bla(CMY-2) predominated; prevalence then dropped to 20% (12.9-29.6%) at laying phase. In fattening broilers, prevalence was 69.2% (53.6-81.3%) at the start of production, 54.2% (38.9-68.6%) at slaughter time, and 61.3% (48.1-72.9%) in carcasses. Significantly decreasing and increasing trends for respectively bla(CMY-2) and bla(CTX-M-1) gene occurrences were found across subsequent production stages. ESBL/pAmpC E. coli genetic background appeared complex and bla-gene/phylogroup associations indicated clonal and horizontal transmission. Modelling revealed that the average transfer of ESBL/pAmpC E. coli genes between subsequent production stages was 47.7% (42.3-53.4%). We concluded that ESBL/pAmpC E. coli in the broiler production pyramid is prevalent, with substantial transfer between subsequent production levels.

AB Background
   Malaria remains a major public health problem, especially in sub-Sahara African countries. The Malaria Control Program of Ghana has implemented Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) intervention in the Upper West Region in 2015. This preventive drug has been recommended by WHO as very safe and effective in preventing malaria in children under five years. This study assessed community acceptability of the SMC intervention in the Lawra district of Northern Ghana.
   Methodology
   This was a qualitative study where focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were conducted with community-based health volunteers and parents whose children received the SMC drug. Purposive sampling method was used to select study participants. The interviews were recorded with consent of study participants. All interviews were transcribed and coded into emergent themes using Nvivo 10 software before thematic content analysis.
   Results
   Study participants perceived that the introduction of the SMC intervention in the area had helped to reduce the prevalence of malaria among children less than five years of age. Parents held the view that the drug was very good in preventing malaria. The results also showed high acceptability of the SMC intervention by parents and other community members. Parents reported that they were willing to allow their children to receive the drug and wished the intervention could continue in the district for children to continue to benefit. Nonetheless, negative attitude on the part of few parents made them not to allow their children to receive the drug.
   Conclusion
   The interpretation of our data showed high acceptability of the SMC by stakeholders in the study area. However, intensive and continued health education on the benefits of the SMC drug could help to further improve acceptability of the program.

AB BackgroundTuberculosis (TB) continues to be a public health challenge in Saudi Arabia, particularly for the elderly. This study was conducted to estimate mortality per 1000 person-year among TB and resistant TB cases and to identifying factors associated with mortality.MethodsThis is a retrospective cohort study of 713 new TB cases at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh diagnosed between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2016. Patient medical records and microbiology lab databases were used to identify TB cases. Through reviews were conducted of patients' medical records, including physician notes, physical examinations, radiology (scans and imaging), laboratory tests, and follow-up notes. Collected data include demographic information, clinical features, diagnoses, comorbidities, and death rates.ResultsOf the 713TB patients included in this study, 110 died, giving an average mortality rate of 22 per 1000 person-years (PY; 95% CI: 18.2-26.4). Elderly patients ( 60years) had a higher mortality rate of 36.5 per 1000 PY (95% CI: 28.9-45.5). As age increases by one year, the hazard of mortality increase by 2.4% (aHR: 1.024 [95% CI: 1.009-1.039, P=0.002]). Higher hazard of mortality was found among males (aHR: 2.014 [95% CI: 1.186-3.418, P=0.010]). Patients with respiratory and other types of comorbidities and cancer had a higher mortality hazard (aHR: 1.898 [95% CI: 1.005-3.582, P=0.048]; aHR: 2.346 [95% CI: 1.313-4.192, P=0.004]; aHR: 3.292 [95% CI: 1.804-6.006, P=0.001]), respectively. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) was found in 2 cases (0.28%) (95% CI: 0.08-1.02), 1.68% were resistant to only one antibiotic, 0.14% had rifampicine-resistant TB (RR-TB), 0.28% had MDR-TB, and 0.14% had extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB).ConclusionsThe mortality rate among TB patients was found to be 22 per 1000 person-year at our center. TB was associated with high mortality rates among males, the elderly, and patients with cancer, respiratory illness, and other comorbidities. Future clinical practice should include establishing an efficient TB diagnostic program and continued hazard assessment of TB treatment options.

AB BackgroundUnderstanding the underlying epidemiology that shapes Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC), and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infections can contribute to data driven policies directed towards curbing the proliferation of these pathogens in Ghana. Information on the symptoms and risk factors for STIs will help to identify high-risk individuals which will in turn inform STI syndromic management and tailor the use of public health resources.MethodsParticipants were from 4 military clinics and 1 civilian STI clinic in Ghana and eligible if they had symptoms suggestive of STI. First void urine samples were collected and tested with Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT). A structured questionnaire was administered to all participants. Multivariate logistic regression identified factors associated with infection, separately for NG and for CT and for men and women.ResultsA total of 950 patients, 58% of whom were females were enrolled, 28% had gonorrhea and 11% had chlamydia with more males testing positive than females. Reported symptoms that were more common among patients who tested positive for gonorrhea were painful urination and urethral discharge (all P values <0.05). Additionally, multiple sexual partners and alcohol use were statistically associated with higher rates of gonorrhea in males while only the frequency of condom use was associated with gonorrhea for females. None of the symptoms or risk factors except marital status was associated with testing positive for chlamydia.ConclusionIdentifying these symptoms and risk factors help inform health care delivery systems for STIs in Ghana. Furthermore, men and women presenting with these symptoms and risk factors are a prime target for public health education campaigns, aimed at curbing the spread of gonorrhea and chlamydia infections.

ID KNOWLEDGE; COVERAGE; MEDIA
AB BackgroundMisleading news claims can be detrimental to public health. We aimed to improve the alignment between causal claims and evidence, without losing news interest (counter to assumptions that news is not interested in communicating caution).MethodsWe tested two interventions in press releases, which are the main sources for science and health news: (a) aligning the headlines and main causal claims with the underlying evidence (strong for experimental, cautious for correlational) and (b) inserting explicit statements/caveats about inferring causality. The participants' were press releases on health-related topics (N=312; control=89, claim alignment=64, causality statement=79, both=80) from nine press offices (journals, universities, funders). Outcomes were news content (headlines, causal claims, caveats) in English-language international and national media (newspapers, websites, broadcast; N=2257), news uptake (% press releases gaining news coverage) and feasibility (% press releases implementing cautious statements).ResultsNews headlines showed better alignment to evidence when press releases were aligned (intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) 56% vs 52%, OR=1.2 to 1.9; as-treated analysis (AT) 60% vs 32%, OR=1.3 to 4.4). News claims also followed press releases, significant only for AT (ITT 62% vs 60%, OR=0.7 to 1.6; AT, 67% vs 39%, OR=1.4 to 5.7). The same was true for causality statements/caveats (ITT 15% vs 10%, OR=0.9 to 2.6; AT 20% vs 0%, OR 16 to 156). There was no evidence of lost news uptake for press releases with aligned headlines and claims (ITT 55% vs 55%, OR=0.7 to 1.3, AT 58% vs 60%, OR=0.7 to 1.7), or causality statements/caveats (ITT 53% vs 56%, OR=0.8 to 1.0, AT 66% vs 52%, OR=1.3 to 2.7). Feasibility was demonstrated by a spontaneous increase in cautious headlines, claims and caveats in press releases compared to the pre-trial period (OR=1.01 to 2.6, 1.3 to 3.4, 1.1 to 26, respectively).ConclusionsNews claimseven headlinescan become better aligned with evidence. Cautious claims and explicit caveats about correlational findings may penetrate into news without harming news interest. Findings from AT analysis are correlational and may not imply cause, although here the linking mechanism between press releases and news is known. ITT analysis was insensitive due to spontaneous adoption of interventions across conditions.Trial registrationISRCTN10492618 (20 August 2015)

AB BackgroundSedentary behaviour has become a growing public health concern. Currently, it is a common belief that screen time (SCT) is a key factor in high overall sedentary time (ST) and is often used as a primary outcome. However, the evidence is lacking. Therefore, this study investigated the association of objectively assessed total ST with SCT among children. Further, SCT was investigated separately for sedentary level, weight status, gender, and migration background.MethodsFor 198 primary school children (7.10.7years, boys: 43.9%) ST was assessed objectively using a multi-sensor device (Actiheart (R); CamNtech, Cambridge, UK). The sample was split into three groups (tertiles) to investigate SCT of children with low, medium and high ST. SCT and socio-demographic parameters, such as migration background, were assessed using a parental questionnaire; anthropometric data was collected at schools.ResultsAbsolut SCT did not differ significantly among the three sedentary groups: Daily average of SCT was 83.855.0min (27.4% of ST) for children with high ST, 82.8 +/- 50.5min (39.8% of ST) for children with medium ST, and 77.2 +/- 59.4min (71.3% of ST) for those with low ST. However, relatively the SCT percentage of total ST was significantly higher among children with low ST (p<0.01). Significantly higher SCT was found in children with migration background (p<0.01), while underweight children had significantly less SCT (p<0.05). An association of total SCT and overall ST was found for the whole sample (B=17.11, [2.75; 31.48], p=0.02), but did not remain when analysis were separated for the groups, except for normal weight children (B=15.97, [0.13; 31.81], p=0.05).ConclusionsThe amount of SCT is the same among high, low and medium sedentary children, and high ST is largely independent of SCT. Therefore, SCT cannot be the key contributor to high ST and should not solely be used for predicting or changing children's sedentary behaviour. Moreover, children's weight status to classify activity levels and the role of possible compensation mechanisms should be considered in future research and when trying to intervene on ST.Trial registrationGerman Clinical Trials Register (DRKS), DRKS-ID: DRKS00000494 DATE: 25/08/2010.

   needed to improve and protect population health
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Non-communicable disease; Response; Poor outcomes; Parity; Incident
   control approach
AB In 2017 Public Health England were asked to assist with investigating why 1-year cancer survival rates appeared lower than expected in a local area. We identified 50 premature deaths that surveillance data suggested we would not expect. These deaths highlighted a gap in recognising and responding to this kind of systematic non communicable disease (NCD) outcome variation. We hypothesise that the lack of a universally agreed systematic response to variations is not only counter-intuitive, but wholly unacceptable where non-communicable diseases (NCDs) rather than infectious diseases have become the leading causes of illness and death worldwide. In the United Kingdom (UK) alone over 89% of mortality in 2014 was attributable to NCDs. We argue that a new approach is urgently needed to turn the curve on NCD outcome variation to protect and improve the public's health. We set out a definition of an NCD incident and propose a phased approach that could be used to respond to local variation in NCD outcomes.Establishing parity of response for local variations in NCD outcomes and CD control is critically important. Although evidence shows that prevention and early intervention will make the biggest difference to NCD incidence, collective local whole health economy response, exploiting the wealth of surveillance data in real time, needs to be at the heart of responding to variations in NCD outcomes at a population level. We argue that local and national public health agencies should mandate a standardised incident' response to significant changes in outcomes from NCD to mitigate and reduce the loss of quality life.

AB BackgroundThe inadequate management of solid waste impacts populations' health and quality of life, and disproportionately affects developing countries. This study aims to describe a protocol for epidemiological diagnosis, the purpose being to estimate the prevalence of chronic and communicable and non communicable diseases in waste pickers, and the occupational and environmental risk factors to which these are exposed.MethodsThis is a cross-sectional study, based on survey design in an area of extreme social vulnerability - the largest garbage dump in Latin America. Using a multidimensional research protocol, divided in three stages: 1- The identification of the subjects, and the scheduling of tests; 2- Situational diagnosis through interviews, anthropometric evaluation, measuring blood pressure, collecting hair and nail samples to detect exposure to heavy metals and undertaking laboratory tests; 3- The return of the waste pickers to receive the test results, followed by referral to the health team and to report occupational accidents.ResultsOne thousand twenty-five waste pickers undertook tests and interviews. The majority were women (67.0%), with 36-45years old (45.7%), and 96.0% had children. In total, 27.3% of the participants did not attend to any school and 47.7% were educated only up to primary level. The majority of waste pickers (68.70%) reported accidents and most of them (89.69%) were related to sharp objects. The mean time working in this open dump was 15years. According the anthropometric measure, 32.6% were overweight and 21.1% were obese. The most common reported diseases were: osteomuscular disorders (78.7%); arboviruses (28.6%); episodic diarrhea (24.9%); hypertension (24.2%); bronchitis (14.3%); intestinal worms (12.6%) and diabetes (10.1%). According to the blood tests, the values outside the reference limits were: Uric acid (23.89%); creatinine (54.06%); GGT range (16.04%); SGOT - Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (5.29%); SGPT - serum Glutamic-Pyruvic Transaminase (35.52%).ConclusionsThis study is the first to evaluate multiple risks and diseases in the majority of waste pickers working in the largest garbage dump of a continent. These findings highlight the importance to address urgently the environmental, social and health impacts related to the management of solid waste in developmental countries to protect these workers and their families.

AB The perspectives of social selection and causation have long been debated. Social selection theory is as "social" as social causation theory, since all diseases are social and no biological process occurs outside society. To identify the social selection pathway and historical juncture affected by socioeconomic and political changes, we investigated the reciprocal impact of suffering from tuberculosis (TB) on the current socioeconomic position (SEP), stratified by childhood SEP. We also examined the extent to which the social consequences of ill health changed since the East Asian economic downturn. Data were collected for 2007-2012 from the Korea National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey. To identify associations between TB history and current household income (HHI), we constructed an ordinal logistic regression model adjusted for covariates, including age, gender, educational attainment, and job status. We adopted a recursive regression model to examine trend changes in this association from 1980-2012 to 2003-2012. Of 28,136 participants, 936 had experienced TB. In the first ordinal logistic regression, the TB group was more likely to have lower HHI than the non-TB group. The odds ratios (ORs) increased from 1.30 (1980-2012) to 1.86 (2003-2012) for the TB group, increasing their probability of having low HHI. Among the low childhood SEP group, the TB group's probability of having low HHI was 1.35 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16-1.57) during 1980-2012, which increased to 2.01 (95% CI: 1.37-2.95) during 2003-2012. For the high childhood SEP group, the TB group's OR range fluctuated, similar to that for the non-TB group. The results support the social selection pathway from TB history to adverse impact on current SEP. Our study identified downward social mobility due to TB history among the low childhood SEP group. Moreover, negative social consequences deteriorated since the East Asian economic crisis.

TI Context-dependence of race self-classification: Results from a highly
   mixed and unequal middle-income country
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID GENOMIC ANCESTRY; POPULATION; HEALTH; COLOR
AB Ethnic-racial classification criteria are widely recognized to vary according to historical, cultural and political contexts. In Brazil, the strong influence of individual socio-economic factors on race/colour self-classification is well known. With the expansion of genomic technologies, the use of genomic ancestry has been suggested as a substitute for classification procedures such as self-declaring race, as if they represented the same concept. We investigated the association between genomic ancestry, the racial composition of census tracts and individual socioeconomic factors and self-declared race/colour in a cohort of 15,105 Brazilians. Results show that the probability of self-declaring as black or brown increases according to the proportion of African ancestry and varies widely among cities. In Porto Alegre, where most of the population is white, with every 10% increase in the proportion of African ancestry, the odds of self-declaring as black increased 14 times (95% CI 6.08-32.81). In Salvador, where most of the population is black or brown, that increase was of 3.98 times (95% CI 2.96-5.35). The racial composition of the area of residence was also associated with the probability of self-declaring as black or brown. Every 10% increase in the proportion of black and brown inhabitants in the residential census tract increased the odds of self-declaring as black by 1.33 times (95% CI 1.24-1.42). Ancestry alone does not explain self-declared race/colour. An emphasis on multiple situational contexts (both individual and collective) provides a more comprehensive framework for the study of the predictors of self-declared race/colour, a highly relevant construct in many different scenarios, such as public policy, sociology and medicine.

AB BackgroundDetermining the etiology of pneumonia is essential to guide public health interventions. Diagnostic test results, including from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays of upper respiratory tract specimens, have been used to estimate prevalence of pneumococcal pneumonia. However limitations in test sensitivity and specificity and the specimen types available make establishing a definitive diagnosis challenging. Prevalence estimates for pneumococcal pneumonia could be biased in the absence of a true gold standard reference test for detecting Streptococcus pneumoniae.MethodsWe conducted a case control study to identify etiologies of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) from April 2014 through August 2015 in Thailand. We estimated the prevalence of pneumococcal pneumonia among adults hospitalized for CAP using Bayesian latent class models (BLCMs) incorporating results of real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) testing of upper respiratory tract specimens and a urine antigen test (UAT) from cases and controls. We compared the prevalence estimate to conventional analyses using only UAT as a reference test.ResultsThe estimated prevalence of pneumococcal pneumonia was 8% (95% CI: 5-11%) by conventional analyses. By BLCM, we estimated the prevalence to be 10% (95% CrI: 7-16%) using binary qPCR and UAT results, and 11% (95% CrI: 7-17%) using binary UAT results and qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) values.ConclusionsBLCM suggests a>25% higher prevalence of pneumococcal pneumonia than estimated by a conventional approach assuming UAT as a gold standard reference test. Higher quantities of pneumococcal DNA in the upper respiratory tract were associated with pneumococcal pneumonia in adults but the addition of a second specific pneumococcal test was required to accurately estimate disease status and prevalence. By incorporating the inherent uncertainty of diagnostic tests, BLCM can obtain more reliable estimates of disease status and improve understanding of underlying etiology.

AB Bacteria of the genus Campylobacter are an important cause of human illness worldwide. Campylobacter infections are expressed as gastroenteritis and can lead to severe sequelae like reactive arthritis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. In Germany, Campylobacter-associated gastroenteritis cases are notifiable but there is no reporting obligation for the sequelaes and the disease burden is clearly underestimated. The aim of our study was to quantify reliably the current disease burden of all Campylobacter spp.-associated diseases for Germany with the method of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). DALYs combine mortality and morbidity in a single summary measure, whereby one DALY represents the loss of one year in full health. For acute gastroenteritis, we estimated 967 DALYs of which only 484 DALYs were detected within the reporting system. Overall, we estimated that 8811 DALYs were caused by the campylobacter-related diseases known so far. 98% of the DALYs were associated with morbidity and 2% with mortality. Mortality was caused by the health outcomes Gastroenteritis and Guillain-Barre syndrome exclusively.

TI Fora fuelling the discovery of fortified dietary supplements - An

   food supplements based on the reported effects of their users
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Dietary supplements are products that are widely used for instance as energisers or to lose weight. There have been cases reported where undeclared ingredients present in such supplements have caused adverse effects on the health of the user. As there are many different products to choose from, it seems impossible to predict which might contain harmful components and to ban them from the market. Nonetheless, the use of dietary supplements and the experiences of users are shared in online discussions. We describe the development of a search engine to retrieve products associated with certain effects. Upon application we were able to retrieve a list of dietary supplements that are repeatedly associated with excessive effects by users on public fora. The top of the list contains supplements that have previously been banned because they contained undeclared harmful components. The use of the search engine as described here is a powerful method for making a risk-based selection of dietary supplements which can then be analysed for the presence of illegal or other unwanted components.

DT Article

AB In recent years, communities and institutions have sought new interventions intended to reduce sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption among children. Among these interventions are "SSB-free zones," where such beverages are not permitted to be consumed on the premises. Insufficient knowledge still exists, however, about the readiness for such restrictive SSB policies within health care institutions. Understanding attitudes toward SSB consumption among adults is necessary to guide an institution-wide policy, where staff and patients serve as role models for parents and their children. We conducted focus groups with health center patients and staff to determine perceptions surrounding health and SSB consumption and to better understand the support and readiness (or lack thereof) for an SSB-free zone intervention prior to its implementation. We found that contextual practices present challenges to breaking personal consumption habits, even if beverages are banned from the worksite. Nevertheless, participants expressed support for SSB-free zones, and recommended more education about the harmful effects of soda and energy drink consumption to help improve acceptability for the policy. We conclude that policies restricting onsite SSB consumption may be more effective when combined with educational information and expressions of understanding that this specific behavior change can be difficult.

AB BackgroundHealth policy focuses on reducing antibiotic prescribing that in order to succeed requires the public to hold similar attitudes towards judicious use. Social network influences on health behaviour and attitudes are well established and yet these influences are not sufficiently acknowledged in the UK's antibiotic stewardship programmes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate individuals' attitudes and behaviours towards antibiotics and also identify the social network influences on these in the process of help seeking for self-limiting illnesses.MethodsFrom a social network approach the methods used were a personal community mapping exercise which was carried out ahead of a semi-structured interview. A purposive sample was drawn from across the Wessex region and participants were recruited via GP practices and pharmacists. In total 14 adults, and 10 parents of children, who had received a prescription for antibiotics for a self-limiting illness within the 3 months preceding the interview were recruited and interviewed.ResultsThree network types were identified; diverse, family and friend and restricted. The type of network an individual has appears to have an influence on antibiotic attitudes and behaviours. Most notably, the more diverse a network the more likely the individual will delay in help seeking from healthcare professionals as they draw upon self-care strategies advised by network members. The role of the GP varies according to network type too. Individuals' with diverse networks draw upon GP network members to provide clarity and certainty following a period of self-care. People with restricted networks are more reliant upon the GP, seek help quicker and also more likely to prioritise the GPs advice over other sources of information.ConclusionThe understanding a social network approach brings to help seeking behaviour for antibiotics could help practitioners modify their consultation approach to mitigate some uncertainties and perceptions around prescribing behaviour.

AB BackgroundQualitative research studies are becoming increasingly necessary to understand the complex challenges in the healthcare setting. Successfully integrating interdisciplinary teams of investigators can be challenging, as investigators inherently view data through their disciplinary lens. Thus, new methods, such as focused conservation, are needed to facilitate qualitative data analysis by interdisciplinary teams. The purpose of this manuscript is to provide a clear description of how we implemented the focused conversation method to facilitate an organized data-driven discussion that responded to our study objectives and ensured participation of our interdisciplinary team. The focused conversation method has not, to our knowledge, been utilized for this purpose to date.MethodsTo better understand the experience of healthcare personnel (HCP) during preparations for the 2014-2015 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak, we interviewed HCP who participated in decision making about EVD preparations and training of workers in the use of enhanced personal protective equipment ensembles in the metropolitan Chicagoland area of Illinois to attain a priori research objectives. We identified a systematic method - the focused conversation method - that enabled our interdisciplinary team to interactively contribute to the framing, analysis and interpretation of the data that would enable us to focus on our research objectives.ResultsThe focused conversation developed to support our a priori research objective about the training of HCP in preparations included objective, reflective, interpretive and decisional questions. These questions grounded the conversation in the data, while leveraging discipline-specific lenses and professional experience in the analysis and interpretation. Insights from the conversation were reviewed later against interview transcripts to ensure validity. The conversation identified areas for future research directions and deficiencies in the interview instrument.ConclusionsThe focused conversation is an efficient, organized method for analysis of qualitative data by an interdisciplinary team.

AB BackgroundHospitals need to understand how to reduce their frontline employees' turnover rate as well as how to positively engage them and improve their service. Central to these issues, we find, is the employees' perception of their organization's attractiveness. This objective of this paper is to clarify how the role of organizational attractiveness relates to frontline employees' perception of their internal market-oriented culture as well as their turnover rate, engagement, and service quality. To our knowledge, no previous research has explored the role of organizational attractiveness from a frontline employee perspective in health-service organizations.MethodsThe conceptual framework we developed was tested in a quantitative study. We sent a questionnaire to nurses in several public hospitals in Norway. We then analyzed the data with confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling in Stata. Further, we performed multi-group comparisons to test heterogeneity in personal characteristics. The indirect effects were tested by mediator analyses.ResultsWe made three main findings. First, organizational attractiveness has a significant positive effect on frontline employees' engagement (=0.833) as well as on the service quality they provide to hospital patients (=0.472). Additionally, it significantly lowers their turnover rate (=-0.729). Second, the internal market-oriented culture' (IMOC) has a significantly positive effect on organizational attractiveness (=0.587) and explains a total of 35% of the variance in organizational attractiveness. Third, organizational attractiveness fully mediates the relationship between internal market-oriented culture (IMOC) and frontline employees' engagement and the service quality they provide to patients, and it partially mediates the relationship with the turnover rate.ConclusionsThis study proves that organizational attractiveness is vital for hospital managers to focus on, as it affects employees' perception of whether the organizations is a great place to work. It reveals the need for those same managers to develop an internal market-oriented culture (IMOC) directed toward hospital frontline employees, as it has both a direct effect on organizational attractiveness and an indirect effect on employees' engagement, turnover intention, and service quality.

AB BackgroundPatients in Yemen commonly visit community pharmacies to obtain consultation or treatment for common ailments. Community pharmacists have an opportunity to optimize medication use and improve patient outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the attitudes and practices of community pharmacists regarding their participation in public health activities and barriers to their participation in these activities.MethodsThis cross-sectional study was carried out among community pharmacists working in pharmacies located in urban areas of the Aden governorate of Yemen from March to June 2017 using a self-administered questionnaire. We selected pharmacies from a line list using proportional sampling according to the number of pharmacies in the urban areas of each district. The questionnaire contained four sections: demographic characteristics, attitudes, practices, and barriers encountered. Data were analyzed descriptively, and the Chi-square test was used for analyzing the association of variables (alpha=0.05).ResultsThe questionnaire was distributed to 200 community pharmacists working in community pharmacies. Of the 200 respondents, 62% (n=124) were male. Overall, the mean age (sd) was 30.0years (8.6) with the number of years of work experience between 2 and 9.9years (n=158, 79%). On average, 62.3% of the pharmacists had a positive attitude toward participation in public health activities. Providing education to stop tobacco chewing, smoking, alcohol drinking and improve oral hygiene was an important activity of the community pharmacists. Blood pressure measurements (86%, n=172) and glucose tests (45%, n=90) were commonly conducted for clients. Lack of time (71%, n=142) and lack of teamwork (70%, n=140) were mentioned as common barriers to participation in public health activities.ConclusionsCommunity pharmacists had a positive attitude toward public health activities. Health education and routine health tests were important practices of the community pharmacists. Barriers need to be overcome to enable more active participation by community pharmacists in public health activities by consulting with all stakeholders, assessing the situation, considering alternatives and taking action.

AB BackgroundConsumption of unwashed, raw or unhygienically prepared fruits and vegetables act as potential source for the spread of various parasitic diseases. Moreover, the level of contamination and species of contaminant parasites vary from place to place because of variations in environmental and human factors. Therefore local determination of the level of contamination and associated factors is important for efficient intervention of infections acquired via those food items.MethodsA Cross-sectional study was conducted among purchased vegetables in selected markets of Arba Minch town from January to March, 2018. A structured questionnaire was used to capture data about factors associated with parasitic contamination of vegetables in the marketing phase. Selected vegetables were purchased and processed for examination of parasitic contamination using direct wet mount, iodine wet mount and modified zeihl Neelson staining following standard protocols. All data were analyzed using SPSS version 20.0.ResultsAmong 347 vegetable samples examined, 87(25.1%) were contaminated with at least one parasite species. Tomato (35.0%) was the most commonly contaminated vegetable while green pepper (10.6%) was the least contaminated one. Entameoba histolytica/dispar (29, 8.4%) was the commonest parasitic contaminant detected followed by Giardia lamblia (24, 6.9%) and oocyst of Cryptosporidium species (5.8%). Vegetable type (X-2=13.5; p=0.009) and source of vegetables (X-2=24.1; p<0.001) were significantly associated with parasitic contamination of vegetables.ConclusionParasitic contamination rate among marketed vegetables in the present study is significantly considerable. Entameoba histolytica /dispar was the most frequently detected parasite. We recommend to the local public health sector to establish a system for continuous monitoring of contamination of vegetables sold at local markets.

AB BackgroundThe global expansion of dengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV), and Zika viruses (ZIKV) is having a serious impact on public health. Because these arboviruses are transmitted by the same mosquito species and co-circulate in the same area, a sensitive diagnostic assay that detects them together, with discrimination, is needed.MethodsWe present here a diagnostics panel based on reverse transcription-PCR amplification of viral RNA and an xMap Luminex architecture involving direct hybridization of PCRamplicons and virus-specific probes. Two DNA innovations (artificially expanded genetic information systems, AEGIS, and self-avoiding molecular recognition systems, SAMRS) increase the hybridization sensitivity on Luminex microspheres and PCR specificity of the multiplex assay compared to the standard approach (standard nucleotides).ResultsThe diagnostics panel detects, if they are present, these viruses with a resolution of 20 genome equivalents (DENV1), or 10 (DENV3-4, CHIKV) and 80 (DENV2, ZIKV) genome equivalents per assay. It identifies ZIKV, CHIKV and DENV RNAs in a single infected mosquito, in mosquito pools comprised of 5 to 50 individuals, and mosquito saliva (ZIKV, CHIKV, and DENV2). Infected mosquitoes and saliva were also collected on a cationic surface (Q-paper), which binds mosquito and viral nucleic acids electrostatically. All samples from infected mosquitoes displayed only target-specific signals; signals from non-infected samples were at background levels.ConclusionsOur results provide an efficient and multiplex tool that may be used for surveillance of emerging mosquito-borne pathogens which aids targeted mosquito control in areas at high risk for transmission.

AB BackgroundThe Zambian Ministry of Health implemented a reactive one-dose Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) campaign in April 2016 in three Lusaka compounds, followed by a pre-emptive second-round in December. Understanding uptake of this first-ever two-dose OCV campaign is critical to design effective OCV campaigns and for delivery of oral vaccines in the country and the region.MethodsWe conducted 12 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with men and women who self-reported taking no OCV doses and six with those self-reporting taking both doses. Simple descriptive analysis was conducted on socio-demographic and cholera-related data collected using a short questionnaire. We analyzed transcribed FGDs using the framework of dose, gender and geographic location.ResultsNo differences were found by gender and location. All participants thought cholera to be severe and the reactive OCV campaign as relevant if efficacious. Most reported not receiving information on OCV side-effects and duration of protection. Those who took both doses listed more risk factors (including wind') and felt personally susceptible to cholera and protected by OCV. Some described OCV side-effects, mostly diarrhoea, vomiting and dizziness, as the expulsion of causative agents. Those who did not take OCV felt protected by their good personal hygiene practices or, thought of themselves and OCV as powerless against the multiple causes of cholera including poor living conditions, water, wind, and curse. Most of those who did not take OCV feared side-effects reported by others. Some interpreted side-effects as western' malevolence. Though >80% discussants reported not knowing duration of protection, some who did not vaccinate, suggested that rather than rely on OCV which could lose potency, collective action should be taken to change the physical and economic environment to prevent cholera.ConclusionsDue to incomplete information, individual decision-making was complex, rooted in theories of disease causation, perceived susceptibility, circulating narratives, colonial past, and observable outcomes of vaccination. To increase coverage, future OCV campaigns may benefit from better communication on eligibility and susceptibility, expected side effects, mechanism of action, and duration of protection. Governmental improvements in the physical and economic environment may increase confidence in OCV and other public health interventions among residents in Lusaka compounds.

AB BackgroundHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected children represent a very vulnerable population for anti-retroviral therapy (ART) drug resistance. As a global target, 90% of patients receiving ART should have HIV-RNA viral suppression. A threshold of >1000 RNA copies/ml is used to define non-suppressed viral load. If it is confirmed in the laboratory, adherence should be addressed and should be followed by the switch to second-line ART. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the rate of viral load suppression among children tested at the Amhara Public Health Institute (APHI), Bahir Dar.MethodsInstitutional based cross-sectional study design was conducted from July 01, 2017 to June 30, 2018, in children under the age of 15years. Socio-demographic, clinical and HIV1RNA viral load data were collected from the excel database. The data were analyzed in SPSS 20.0 statistical software.ResultsA total of 1567 children, age ranged from one to 14years, were tested for HIV viral load. Of which, about 54% were males. Children were treated using nevirapine-based (76.7%), efavirenz-based (21.8%) and protease inhibitor-based (1.5%) anti-retroviral drugs. Non-suppressed HIV viral load was found in 28.3% of the participants. High viral load (>1000 cp/ml) were found in 24% of the children below the age of five years. Children on nevirapine-based treatment had about two times more non-suppressed viral load (Adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.90; 95%CI: 1.41-2.56; P<0.001) compared to those who had efavirenz-based treatment. However, adherence (P: 0.204) was not associated with non-suppressed viral load.ConclusionsThere was a high rate of non-suppressed HIV viral load among children tested at APHI. Specifically, the odds of having a non-suppressed viral load was higher in NVP based treatment users. Hence, comprehensive management and follow up of children on ART, and testing for resistance as well as viral load could help to reduce the problem in advance.

ID RESISTANCE; FAILURE
AB BackgroundMalaria continues to be a public health problem and important cause of morbidity and mortality in Ethiopia. Due to continuous interventions to combat malaria in endemic regions, a decline in malaria related deaths and morbidity has been registered. These gains, however, are threatened with the emergency of antimalarial drugs resistant strains of plasmodium parasites. This study aimed to determine therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine for treatment of Plasmodium vivax malaria cases in Guragae zone, southern central Ethiopia.MethodsA one arm prospective study with recurrence of parasitaemia and clinical conditions of patients were evaluated on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, and 28. Patients with Plasmodium vivax malaria mono infection and eligible for study inclusion criteria were recruited. SPSS-21 used for data analysis and management. Kaplan-Meier survival probability analysis was estimated. Mean geometric parasitaemia and average haemoglobin concentration were calculated.ResultsAmong 87 total recruited subjects, 81 of them completed the 28days follow up. More than half of (57.5%) the study participants had a history of fever and 42.5% of them had fever at the time of enrollment. The mean body temperature on day of recruitment was 38.2 degrees C and 36.8 degrees C on day 28. Geometric mean parasitaemia calculated on day of enrollment was 2270 parasites/l of blood. Recurrence of parasitaemia was registered from two subjects during entire follow up. The mean haemoglobin concentration of study participants on day of enrolment was 11.8g/ dl and 13.8g/dl on day 28.ConclusionThis study registered a high chloroquine efficacy rate among the study participants. Therefore, chloroquine remains efficacious for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax malaria in the study area. However, there is a need to monitor chloroquine resistance by employing molecular tools for better evaluation of treatment outcome.

ID DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINES; CLINICAL UTILITY; BURDEN; SYMPTOMATOLOGY
AB BackgroundThe World Health Organization (WHO) International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) is used globally by 194 WHO member nations. It is used for assigning clinical diagnoses, providing the framework for reporting public health data, and to inform the organization and reimbursement of health services. Guided by overarching principles of increasing clinical utility and global applicability, the 11th revision of the ICD proposes major changes that incorporate empirical advances since the previous revision in 1992. To test recommended changes in the Mental, Behavioral, and Neurodevelopmental Disorders chapter, multiple vignette-based case-controlled field studies have been conducted which examine clinicians' ability to accurately and consistently use the new guidelines and assess their overall clinical utility. This manuscript reports on the results from the study of the proposed ICD-11 guidelines for feeding and eating disorders (FEDs).MethodParticipants were 2288 mental health professionals registered with WHO's Global Clinical Practice Network. The study was conducted in Chinese, English, French, Japanese, and Spanish. Clinicians were randomly assigned to apply either the ICD-11 or ICD-10 diagnostic guidelines for FEDs to a pair of case vignettes designed to test specific clinical questions. Clinicians selected the diagnosis they thought was correct for each vignette, evaluated the presence of each essential feature of the selected diagnosis, and the clinical utility of the diagnostic guidelines.ResultsThe proposed ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines significantly improved accuracy for all FEDs tested relative to ICD-10 and attained higher clinical utility ratings; similar results were obtained across all five languages. The inclusion of binge eating disorder and avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder reduced the use of residual diagnoses. Areas needing further refinement were identified.ConclusionsThe proposed ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines consistently outperformed ICD-10 in distinguishing cases of eating disorders and showed global applicability and appropriate clinical utility. These results suggest that the proposed ICD-11 guidelines for FEDs will help increase accuracy of public health data, improve clinical diagnosis, and enhance health service organization and provision. This is the first time in the revision of the ICD that data from large-scale, empirical research examining proposed guidelines is completed in time to inform the final diagnostic guidelines.

AB BackgroundData are lacking regarding the prevalence of benzodiazepine long-term use in the general population. Our aim was to examine the prevalence of prescribed benzodiazepine long-term use (BLTU) according to sociodemographic and clinical factors in the French general population.MethodsData came from 4686 men and 4849 women included in 2015 in the French population-based CONSTANCES cohort. BLTU was examined using drug reimbursement administrative registries from 2009 to 2015. Analyses were weighted to provide results representative of the French general population covered by the general health insurance scheme. Weighted prevalence of BTLU and weighted Odds Ratios (OR) of having BTLU were computed with their 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI) according to age, education level, occupational status, occupational grade, household income, marital status, alcohol use disorder risk and depressive symptoms. All the analyses were stratified for gender.ResultsWeighted prevalence of BLTU were 2.8%(95% CI:2.3-3.4) and 3.8%(95% CI: 3.3-4.5) in men and women, respectively. Compared to men, women had an increased risk of having benzodiazepine long-term use with OR=1.34(95% CI=1.02-1.76). Aging, low education, not being at-work, low occupational grade, low income, being alone and depressive state were associated with increased risks of having BTLU.ConclusionsBLTU is widespread in the French general population, however this issue may particularly concern vulnerable subgroups. These findings may help in raising attention on this public health burden as well as targeting specific at-risk subgroups in preventive intervention.

AB BackgroundReducing socioeconomic health inequalities among youth is a major challenge for governments around the world and reports on successful attempts are scarce. Socioecological and integral approaches with collaborative partnerships and community engagement are recommended but knowledge about the effectiveness and effective and ineffective elements is limited. The Promising Neighbourhoods program employs such an approach aiming to reduce socioeconomic inequalities in health, safety and talent development in youth. We will evaluate the process-implementation, and effectiveness of the Promising Neighbourhoods program.Methods/designCore elements of Promising Neighbourhoods are a collaborative community programming approach with stakeholders, data-based priority setting, knowledge-, and theory-based policies and evidence-based interventions. Community stakeholders and key-leaders from the neighbourhoods are engaged in the program. For this evaluation study the program will be implemented in three intervention neighbourhoods. These neighbourhoods will be compared to three control neighbourhoods at baseline in 2018/2019 and at follow-up in 2020/2021 after full implementation of the Promising Neighbourhoods program. Intervention neighbourhoods receive a tailored intervention-package including evidence-based interventions and additional measures by community stakeholders. In control neighbourhoods, no special planning will take place thus interventions are offered as usual. A mixed-methods approach following the stages of the logic model from program is applied for this evaluation. Questionnaires, focus groups, and registration data will be collected among community stakeholders, key-leaders, and youth to evaluate the process-implementation of the program. Indicators of intermediate and ultimate outcomes will be studied among N=818 children and N=818 youngsters using difference-in-difference regression analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of the Promising Neighbourhoods program.DiscussionHypotheses are that a collaborative community approach with stakeholders leads to clear priority-setting and better tailored interventions of better quality. We further hypothesise a decline in socioeconomic inequalities in intermediate and ultimate outcomes for health, safety and talent development in the intervention neighbourhoods in comparison to control neighbourhoods. The results add knowledge about effective and ineffective elements of collaborative community programming approaches to reduce health inequalities in youth and thus are relevant for local and national public health authorities.Trial registrationNetherlands National Trial Register number NL7279.

AB BackgroundSurveys of young people under-represent those in alternative education settings (AES), potentially disguising health inequalities. We present the first quantitative UK evidence of health inequalities between AES and mainstream education school (MES) pupils, assessing whether observed inequalities are attributable to socioeconomic, familial, educational and peer factors.MethodsCross-sectional, self-reported data on individual- and poly-substance use (PSU: combined tobacco, alcohol and cannabis use) and sexual risk-taking from 219 pupils in AES (mean age 15.9years) were compared with data from 4024 pupils in MES (mean age 15.5years). Data were collected from 2008 to 2009 as part of the quasi-experimental evaluation of Healthy Respect 2 (HR2).ResultsAES pupils reported higher levels of substance use, including tobacco use, weekly drunkenness, using cannabis at least once a week and engaging in PSU at least once a week. AES pupils also reported higher levels of sexual health risk behaviours than their MES counterparts, including: earlier sexual activity; less protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs); and having 3+ lifetime sexual partners. In multivariate analyses, inequalities in sexual risk-taking were fully explained after adjusting for higher deprivation, lower parental monitoring, lower parent-child connectedness, school disengagement and heightened intentions towards early parenthood among AES vs MES pupils. However, an increased risk (OR=1.73, 95% CI 1.15, 2.60) of weekly PSU was found for AES vs MES pupils after adjusting for these factors and the influence of peer behaviours.ConclusionAES pupils are more likely to engage in health risk behaviours, including PSU and sexual risk-taking, compared with MES pupils. AES pupils are a vulnerable group who may not be easily targeted by conventional population-level public health programmes. Health promotion interventions need to be tailored and contextualised for AES pupils, in particular for sexual health and PSU. These could be included within interventions designed to promote broader outcomes such as mental wellbeing, educational engagement, raise future aspirations and promote resilience.

AB BackgroundSince 2009, in Ontario, reportable disease surveillance data has been used for timely in-season estimates of influenza severity (i.e., hospitalizations and deaths). Due to changes in reporting requirements influenza reporting no longer captures these indicators of severity, necessitating exploration of other potential sources of data. The purpose of this study was to complete a retrospective analysis to assess the comparability of influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths captured in the Ontario reportable disease information system to those captured in Ontario's hospital-based discharge database.MethodsHospitalizations and deaths of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases reported during the 2010-11 to 2013-14 influenza seasons were analyzed. Information on hospitalizations and deaths for laboratory-confirmed influenza cases were obtained from two databases; the integrated Public Health Information System, which is the provincial reportable disease database, and the Discharge Abstract Database, which contains information on all in-patient hospital visits using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Canada (ICD-10-CA) coding standards. Analyses were completed using the ICD-10J09 and J10 diagnosis codes as an indicator for laboratory-confirmed influenza, and a secondary analysis included the physician-diagnosed influenza J11 diagnosis code.ResultsFor each season, reported hospitalizations for laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in the reportable disease data were higher compared to hospitalizations with J09 and J10 diagnoses codes, but lower when J11 codes were included. The number of deaths was higher in the reportable disease data, whether or not J11 codes were included. For all four seasons, the weekly trends in the number of hospitalizations and deaths were similar for the reportable disease and hospital data (with and without J11), with seasonal peaks occurring during the same week or within 1 week of each other.ConclusionIn our retrospective analyses we found that hospital data provided a reliable estimate of the trends of influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths compared to the reportable disease data for the 2010-11 to 2013-14 influenza seasons in Ontario, but may under-estimate the total seasonal number of deaths. Hospital data could be used for retrospective end-of-season assessments of severity, but due to delays in data availability are unlikely to be timely estimates of severity during in-season surveillance.

TI Machine learning to refine decision making within a syndromic

ID SYSTEM; CLASSIFIERS; DIAGNOSIS; NETWORKS
AB BackgroundWorldwide, syndromic surveillance is increasingly used for improved and timely situational awareness and early identification of public health threats. Syndromic data streams are fed into detection algorithms, which produce statistical alarms highlighting potential activity of public health importance. All alarms must be assessed to confirm whether they are of public health importance. In England, approximately 100 alarms are generated daily and, although their analysis is formalised through a risk assessment process, the process requires notable time, training, and maintenance of an expertise base to determine which alarms are of public health importance. The process is made more complicated by the observation that only 0.1% of statistical alarms are deemed to be of public health importance. Therefore, the aims of this study were to evaluate machine learning as a tool for computer-assisted human decision-making when assessing statistical alarms.MethodsA record of the risk assessment process was obtained from Public Health England for all 67,505 statistical alarms between August 2013 and October 2015. This record contained information on the characteristics of the alarm (e.g. size, location). We used three Bayesian classifiers- naive Bayes, tree-augmented naive Bayes and Multinets - to examine the risk assessment record in England with respect to the final Decision' outcome made by an epidemiologist of Alert', Monitor' or No-action'. Two further classifications based upon tree-augmented naive Bayes and Multinets were implemented to account for the predominance of No-action' outcomes.ResultsThe attributes of each individual risk assessment were linked to the final decision made by an epidemiologist, providing confidence in the current process. The naive Bayesian classifier performed best, correctly classifying 51.5% of Alert' outcomes. If the Alert' and Monitor' actions are combined then performance increases to 82.6% correctly classified. We demonstrate how a decision support system based upon a naive Bayes classifier could be operationalised within an operational syndromic surveillance system.ConclusionsWithin syndromic surveillance systems, machine learning techniques have the potential to make risk assessment following statistical alarms more automated, robust, and rigorous. However, our results also highlight the importance of specialist human input to the process.

AB BackgroundEating habits are established during childhood and track into adolescence and later in life. Given that these habits have a large public health impact and influence the increasing rates of childhood obesity worldwide, there is a need for effective, evidence-based prevention trials promoting healthy eating habits in the first 2years of life.The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate the effect of an eHealth intervention called Food4toddlers, aiming to promote healthy dietary habits in toddlers by targeting parents' awareness of their child's food environment (i.e., how food is provided or presented) and eating environment (e.g., feeding practices and social interaction). This paper describes the rationale, development, and evaluation design of this project.Methods/designWe developed a 6-month eHealth intervention, with the extensive user involvement of health care nurses and parents of toddlers. This intervention is in line with the social cognitive theory, targeting the interwoven relationship between the person, behavior, and environment, with an emphasis on environmental factors. The intervention website includes recipes, information, activities, and collaboration opportunities. The Food4toddlers website can be used as a mobile application. To evaluate the intervention, a two-armed pre-post-follow-up randomized controlled trial is presently being conducted in Norway. Parents of toddlers (n=404) were recruited via social media (Facebook) and 298 provided baseline data of their toddlers at age 12months. After baseline measurements, participants were randomly allocated to an intervention group or control group. Primary outcomes are the child's diet quality and food variety. All participants will be followed up at age 18months, 2years, and 4years.DiscussionThe results of this trial will provide evidence to increase knowledge about the effectiveness of an eHealth intervention targeting parents and their toddler's dietary habits.Trial registrationISRCTN92980420.

AB BackgroundRecent economic development in China has been accompanied by well-documented health inequalities between regions. The impact of individual factors on child height has been widely studied, but the influence of community-level factors has not yet been fully studied.MethodsThe cross-sectional data of 1606 Chinese children aged 5-18years from the China Health and Nutrition Survey 2011 were used. Multilevel analysis was used to examine the association of community factors (using urbanization index) with child height. Child height was measured following standardized procedures, and height-for-age Z scores were calculated as outcome variables. Datasets were presented at two levels: community variable (Level-2) was an urbanization index which is a composite score summarizing 12 community-level contextual factors. Individual variables (Level-1) were child gender, ethnicity, percentage of energy intake from protein, maternal height, maternal education level, and family income.ResultsUrbanization index was associated with child height. Among the 12community-level factors, education' were positively associated with child height. Additionally, stratified analyses by age showed that population density' and housing' were positively significantly associated with the height of elder children (13-18years). At the individual level, male sex, higher maternal height, higher maternal education levels, higher family income, and higher percentage of energy intake from protein, were significantly positively associated with child height.ConclusionsOur findings point to the role of contextual factors that generate differences between regions in shaping the distribution of child physical health outcomes. Our study suggests that public health programs and policies for child's physical development may need to combine individual-centered strategies and also approaches aimed at changing residential environments.

   regional research programme: An action research project informed by
   Normalisation Process Theory
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CHALLENGES; IMPLEMENTATION; PARTICIPATION; PROFESSIONALS; IMPACT
AB Background
   Patient and public involvement (PPI) is a requirement for UK health and social care research funding. Evidence for how best to implement PPI in research programmes, such as National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaborations for Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRCs), remains limited. This paper reports findings from an action research (AR) project called IMPRESS, which aims to strengthen PPI within CLAHRC East of England (EoE). IMPRESS combines AR with Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) to explore PPI within diverse case study projects, identifying actions to implement, test and refine to further embed PPI.
   Methods
   We purposively selected CLAHRC EoE case study projects for in-depth analysis of PPI using NPT. Data were generated from project PPI documentation, semi-structured qualitative interviews with researchers and PPI contributors and focus groups. Transcripts and documents were subjected to abductive thematic analysis and triangulation within case. Systematic across case comparison of themes was undertaken with findings and implications refined through stakeholder consultation.
   Results
   We interviewed 24 researchers and 13 PPI contributors and analysed 28 documents from 10 case studies. Three focus groups were held: two with researchers (n = 4 and n = 6) and one with PPI contributors (n = 5). Findings detail to what extent projects made sense of PPI, bought in to PPI, operationalised PPI and appraised it, thus identifying barriers and enablers to fully embedded PPI.
   Conclusion
   Combining NPT with AR allows us to assess the embeddedness of PPI within projects and programme, to inform specific local action and report broader conceptual lessons for PPI knowledge and practice informing the development of an action framework for embedding PPI in research programmes. To embed PPI within similar programmes teams, professionals, disciplines and institutions should be recognised as variably networked into existing PPI support. Further focus and research is needed on sharing PPI learning and supporting innovation in PPI.

AB Involving patients in research broadens a researcher's field of influence and may generate novel ideas. Preclinical research is integral to the progression of innovative healthcare. These are not patient-facing disciplines and implementing meaningful public and patient involvement (PPI) can be a challenge. A discussion forum and thematic analysis identified key challenges of implementing public and patient involvement for preclinical researchers. In response we developed a "PPI Ready" planning canvas. For contemporaneous evaluation of public and patient involvement, a psychometric questionnaire and an open source tool for its evaluation were developed. The questionnaire measures information, procedural and quality assessment. Combined with the open source evaluation tool, researchers are notified if public and patient involvement is unsatisfactory in any of these areas. The tool is easy to use and adapts a psychometric test into a format familiar to preclinical scientists. Designed to be used iteratively across a research project, it provides a simple reporting grade to document satisfaction trend over the research lifecycle.

SO PLOS ONE

ID DNA-DAMAGE; CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA; INSIGHTS
AB Opisthorchiasis caused by food-borne trematode Opisthorchis felineus is a substantial public health problem, with 17 million persons infected worldwide. This chronic disease is associated with hepatobiliary inflammation, cholangiocyte dysplasia, cholangiofibrosis, intraepithelial neoplasia, and even cholangiocarcinoma among chronically infected individuals. To provide first insights into the mechanism by which O. felineus infection causes pre-cancerous liver lesions, we investigated the level of oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation byproducts and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine) as well as the time course profiles of chronic inflammation and fibrogenesis markers in the dynamics of opisthorchiasis from 1 month to 1.5 years postinfection in an experimental model based on golden hamsters Mesocricetus auratus. For the first time, we showed that O. felineus infection provokes time-dependent accumulation of oxidative hepatobiliary lesions in the injured liver of hamsters. In particular, over the course of infection, lipid peroxidation byproducts 4-hydroxynonenal and malondialdehyde were upregulated; these changes in general correlate with the dynamics of hepatic histopathological changes. We detected macrophages with various immunophenotypes and elevated levels of CD68, COX2, and CD163 in the O. felineus infected animals. Meanwhile, there was direct time-dependent elevation of TNF-alpha (R = 0.79; p < 0.001) and CD163 protein levels (R = 0.58; p = 0.022). We also provide quantitative data about epithelial hyperplasia marker CK7 and a marker of myofibroblast activation (alpha smooth muscle actin). Our present data provide first insights into the histopathological mechanism by which O. felineus infection causes liver injuries. These findings support the inclusion of O. felineus in Group 1 of biological carcinogens.

AB Introduction
   Despite the benefits of early antenatal care visits for early prevention, detection, and treatment of potential complications in pregnancy, a high level of provider adherence to first-visit antenatal care standards is needed. However, little information is available regarding provider adherence to antenatal care in Tanzania. This study was performed to assess provider adherence to first-visit antenatal care standards and to apply stratified analysis to identify associated factors in Tanzania.
   Methods
   Data from the 2014-2015 Tanzania Service Provision Assessment Survey were used in this study. Provider adherence to first-visit antenatal care standards was measured using 10 domains: client history; aspects of prior pregnancies; danger signs of the current pregnancy; physical examination; routine tests; HIV testing and counseling; maintaining a healthy pregnancy; iron/folate supplements; tetanus toxoid vaccination, and preparation for delivery. A composite score was then created in which the highest quantile (corresponding to. 60.5%) considered to provider adhering to first-visit antenatal care standards. Initially, a series of unadjusted logistic regression analyses according to the type of facility and managing authority were performed separately at each level (i.e., facility, provider, and client). Thereafter, all variables with P < 0.2 were fitted into the respective stratified multivariable logistic regression analysis using a 5% significance level.
   Results
   A total of 1756 first-visit antenatal care consultations performed by 822 providers in 648 health facilities were analyzed. The overall median [Interquartile range, IQR] adherence to first-visit antenatal care was relatively low at 47.1% [35.7%-60.5%]. After adjusting for selected variables from each level in specific strata, at dispensary; female providers [AOR = 5.5; 95% CI, 1.8-16.4], at health centre; performance of quality assurance [AOR = 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3-3.9], at hospital; availability of routine tests [AOR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.3-4.8] and basic medicine [AOR = 2.8; 95% CI, 1.4-5.7], at public facilities; availability of medicine [AOR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-3.2] and receiving refresher training [AOR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-3.1], and at private facility; receiving external fund from government [AOR = 3.0; 95% CI, 1.1-8.4] were significantly associated with better adherence to first-visit antenatal care standards.
   Conclusions
   The study highlighted the important factors, including the provision of refresher training, regular distribution of basic medicines, and diagnostics equipment which may influence provider adherence to first-visit ANC standards.

AB BackgroundThe global financial crisis and the economic and financial adjustment programme (EFAP) forced the Portuguese government to adopt austerity measures, which also included the health sector. The aim of this study was to analyse factors associated with HIV/AIDS patients' length of stay (LOS) among Portuguese hospitals, and the potential impact of the EFAP measures on hospitalizations among HIV/AIDS patients.MethodsData used in this analysis were collected from the Portuguese database of Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG). We considered only discharges classified under MCD 24 created for patients with HIV infection. A total of 20,361 hospitalizations occurring between 2009 and 2014 in 41 public hospitals were included in the analysis. The outcome was the number of days between hospital admission and discharge dates (LOS). Hierarchical Poisson regression model with random effects was used to analyse the relation between LOS and patient, treatment and setting characteristics. To more effectively analyse the impact of the EFAP implementation on HIV/AIDS hospitalizations, yearly variables, as well as a variable measuring hospitals' financial situation (current ratio) was included.ResultsFor the 5% level, having HIV/AIDS as the principal diagnosis, the number of secondary diagnoses, the number of procedures, and having tuberculosis have a positive impact in HIV/AIDS LOS; while being female, urgent admission, in-hospital mortality, pneumocystis pneumonia, hepatitis C, and hospital's current ratio contribute to the decrease of LOS. Additionally, LOS between 2010 and 2014 was significantly shorter in comparison to 2009. Differences in LOS across hospitals are significant after controlling for these variables.ConclusionFollowing the EFAP, a number of cost-containment measures in the health sector were implemented. Results from our analysis suggest that the implementation of these measures contributed to a significant decrease is LOS among HIV/AIDS patients in Portuguese hospitals.

ID INFECTIONS
AB BackgroundIn Ethiopia, like other developing countries, intestinal parasitic infections are the major public health problems affecting millions annually. Overcrowding and poor living conditions are the major risk factors. Prison inmates are among the most vulnerable groups to intestinal parasitic infections. However, there is scarcity of epidemiological data regarding intestinal parasites among prison inmates in Ethiopia, notably in Tigrai. Thus, we aimed to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasites and identify the associated factors among inmates of Mekelle prison, Tigrai, Northern Ethiopia.MethodsA cross sectional study involving 291 inmates was conducted from February to June 2017 among inmates of Mekelle prison. After systematically selecting subjects, stool specimens were examined using direct wet mount and formol-ether concentration techniques. We used SPSS version 21 for data analysis. We considered p-value less than 0.05 significant at 95% confidence level.ResultsOf the 291 inmates enrolled in the study, 124 (42.6%) harbored one or more intestinal parasites. The protozoan Entamoeba histolytica/dispar/moshkovskii was the predominant parasite accounted for 68 (23.3%) of the infections followed by Giardia lamblia (10.3%) and Entamoeba coli (8.2%). Fourteen (4.8%) participants were co-infected with different parasite species. The co-infections of Entamoeba histolytica/dispar/moshkovskii and Giardia lamblia were detected among 3.1% of the participants. In bivariate analysis, hand fingernail status (COR 1.86, 95% CI, 1.08-3.20) and duration of stay in prison (COR 2.23, 95% CI 1.31-3.79) were statistically associated with intestinal parasite infections. In multivariable regression, inmates who stayed in the prison for one year or less were more likely to harbor intestinal parasitic infections (p=0.013) than those who stayed longer. No other single predictor variable was found to be significantly associated with intestinal parasitic infections.ConclusionsThe result of this study showed that intestinal parasites are significant health problems among inmates of Mekelle prison.

AB BackgroundPrevious studies have reported an increase in alcohol-and-mixed intoxication (AAMI)-related emergency department (ED) admissions, but less is known about the incidence and characteristics of AAMI admissions to EDs among asylum-seeking patients. Asylum seeking patients may be at higher risk for AAMI due stressors associated with forced migration. The aim of this study was to determine the proportional incidence, population characteristics, and predictors of ED admissions due to AAMI among patients with a residency status of asylum seeker as compared to those with a residency status of Swiss-national.MethodsThis retrospective analysis included all medical consultations from a large, adult ED in Switzerland between January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016. The residency status of consultations was established if possible, and AAMI was determined utilizing a two-step screening procedure, blinded for residency status. A multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine the odds of AAMI in asylum-seeking patient consultations compared to consultations for Swiss-national patients. In addition, patient characteristics among asylum seekers admitted for AAMI were compared to patients with Swiss-national residency status for AAMI.ResultsIn total, 117,716 eligible consultations (Swiss-national patient consultations: n=115,226 and asylum-seeker consultations: n=2490) were included in this study. The proportional incidence of AAMI among asylum seekers was 3.7% (n=92) compared to 1.6% (n=1841) among the Swiss-national patients. AAMI in asylum seekers was associated with higher levels of trauma (37.0% vs. 23.5%, p=0.003), and hospital admission (35.4% vs. 14.1%, p<0.001), but a smaller proportion of chronic alcohol consumption (13.0% vs. 43.5%, p<0.001), and psychiatric referrals (26.1% vs. 49.0%, p<0.001). Multivariable analysis controlling for age, sex, triage category, weekend admission, year of admission, and multiple visits showed a 1.6 times higher odds (95% CI: 1.3, 2.0; p<0.001) for an AAMI-related ED consultation in asylum seeking patients.ConclusionsThese findings show that individuals seeking asylum in a high-income country may be at greater risk for AAMI-related admission than the local population. Given the observed association between AAMI-related ED admissions and trauma, suicidality, and psychiatric referrals among this subpopulation, the data also suggests that co-morbid mental health disorders associated with forced displacement may contribute to hazardous alcohol use.

ID VIRUS
AB BackgroundThe etiology of severe pneumonia is frequently not identified by routine disease surveillance in Thailand. Since 2010, the Thailand Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) and US CDC have conducted surveillance to detect known and new etiologies of severe pneumonia.MethodsSurveillance for severe community-acquired pneumonia was initiated in December 2010 among 30 hospitals in 17 provinces covering all regions of Thailand. Interlinked clinical, laboratory, pathological and epidemiological components of the network were created with specialized guidelines for each to aid case investigation and notification. Severe pneumonia was defined as chest-radiograph confirmed pneumonia of unknown etiology in a patient hospitalized 48h and requiring intubation with ventilator support or who died within 48h after hospitalization; patients with underlying chronic pulmonary or neurological disease were excluded. Respiratory and pathological specimens were tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for nine viruses, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and 14 bacteria. Cases were reported via a secure web-based system.ResultsOf specimens from 972 cases available for testing during December 2010 through December 2015, 589 (60.6%) had a potential etiology identified; 399 (67.8%) were from children aged <5years. At least one viral agent was detected in 394 (40.5%) cases, with the most common of single vial pathogen detected being respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (110/589, 18.7%) especially in children under 5 years. Bacterial pathogens were detected in 341 cases of which 67 cases had apparent mixed infections. The system added MERS-CoV testing in September 2012 as part of Thailand's outbreak preparedness; no cases were identified from the 767 samples tested.ConclusionsEnhanced surveillance improved the understanding of the etiology of severe pneumonia cases and improved the MOPH's preparedness and response capacity for emerging respiratory pathogens in Thailand thereby enhanced global health security. Guidelines for investigation of severe pneumonia from this project were incorporated into surveillance and research activities within Thailand and shared for adaption by other countries.

AB BackgroundFollowing the SARS outbreak, the World Health Organization revised the International Health Regulations to include risk communication as one of the core capacity areas. In 2006, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Global Disease Detection [GDD] program began collaborating with China to enhance China's risk communication capacity to address gaps in the SARS communication response. This article describes tangible improvements in China's public health emergency risk communication capacity between the SARS and H7N9 outbreaks; documents U.S. CDC GDD cooperative technical assistance during 2006-2017; and shares lessons learnt to benefit other countries and contribute to enhance global health security.MethodA questionnaire based on the WHO Joint External Evaluation tool [Risk Communication section] was developed. Akey communications official from the China National Health Commission [NHC] completed the questionnaire retrospectively to reflect China's capacity to manage communication response before, during and after the outbreaks of SARS in 2003, influenza H1N1 in 2009, and influenza H7N9 in 2013. A literature search was also conducted in English and Chinese to further substantiate the results of the questionnaire completed by NHC.ResultsChina demonstrated significantly improved risk communication capacities of pre-event, during event and post event responses to H7N9 when compared to the SARS response. China NHC improved its response through preparedness, availability of dedicated staff and resources for risk communication, internal clearance mechanisms, standard operating procedures with national response parties external to NHC, rumor management, communication with international agencies and consistent messaging with healthcare and private sectors. Correspondingly, the perceived level of trust that the public had in the NHC following outbreaks rose between the SARS and H7N9 response.ConclusionRisk communication capacities in China have increased during the ten years between the SARS outbreak of 2003 and the H7N9 outbreak of 2013. Long-term risk communication capacity building efforts in bilateral collaborations are uncommon. The U.S. CDC GDD project was one of the first such collaborations worldwide. The lessons learned from this project may benefit lower and middle-income countries as they build their national emergency risk communication capacity.

AB BackgroundWe describe the epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of culture-confirmed Shigella infections in facility-based surveillance sites in Guatemala. Current studies using quantitative molecular diagnostics suggest Shigella may contribute most to the global diarrheal disease burden. Since identification of Shigella requires culturing techniques using stool specimens and few laboratories in Guatemala routinely culture for this pathogen, little is known about the true burden of Shigella in Guatemala or, importantly, the antimicrobial resistance patterns.MethodsClinical, epidemiological, and laboratory data were collected on 5399 patients with acute diarrhea (3 loose stools in 24h) from June 2007-August 2012. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was defined as resistance to ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.ResultsFive percent (261) of stool specimens yielded Shigella spp. The annual incidence of laboratory-confirmed infections ranged from 5.0 to 24.1 per 100,000 persons in Santa Rosa and 0.3 to 6.2 per 100,000 in Quetzaltenango; 58% of cases occurred in children <5years of age. Thirty patients were hospitalized; one patient died. Oral rehydration or intravenous solution was used to treat 72% of hospitalized and 15% of ambulatory cases. Fifty-nine percent of cases were S. flexneri and 51% of cases were MDR.ConclusionsShigella is an important cause of bacterial diarrhea in children and prevalence of MDR highlights the importance of appropriate treatment regimens. This study demonstrates that strengthening laboratory capacity in Guatemala can help determine causes which can lead to prevention of diarrheal diseases, particularly in children. Such capacity building is also critical for rapid detection and control of public health threats at their source and therefore for global health security.

AB Since 1979, multiple CDC Kenya programs have supported the development of diagnostic expertise and laboratory capacity in Kenya. In 2004, CDC's Global Disease Detection (GDD) program within the Division of Global Health Protection in Kenya (DGHP-Kenya) initiated close collaboration with Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and developed a laboratory partnership called the Diagnostic and Laboratory Systems Program (DLSP). DLSP built onto previous efforts by malaria, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) programs and supported the expansion of the diagnostic expertise and capacity in KEMRI and the Ministry of Health. First, DLSP developed laboratory capacity for surveillance of diarrheal, respiratory, zoonotic and febrile illnesses to understand the etiology burden of these common illnesses and support evidenced-based decisions on vaccine introductions and recommendations in Kenya. Second, we have evaluated and implemented new diagnostic technologies such as TaqMan Array Cards (TAC) to detect emerging or reemerging pathogens and have recently added a next generation sequencer (NGS). Third, DLSP provided rapid laboratory diagnostic support for outbreak investigation to Kenya and regional countries. Fourth, DLSP has been assisting the Kenya National Public Health laboratory-National Influenza Center and microbiology reference laboratory to obtain World Health Organization (WHO) certification and ISO15189 accreditation respectively. Fifth, we have supported biosafety and biosecurity curriculum development to help Kenyan laboratories safely and appropriately manage infectious pathogens. These achievements, highlight how in collaboration with existing CDC programs working on HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, the Global Health Security Agenda can have significantly improve public health in Kenya and the region. Moreover, Kenya provides an example as to how laboratory science can help countries detect and control of infectious disease outbreaks and other public health threats more rapidly, thus enhancing global health security.

AB BackgroundAntibiotic overuse is the most important modifiable factor contributing to antibiotic resistance. We conducted an educational campaign in Minya, Egypt targeting prescribers and the public through communications focused on appropriate antibiotic use for acute respiratory infections (ARIs).MethodsThe entire population of Minya was targeted by the campaign. Physicians and pharmacists were invited to participate in the pre-intervention assessments. Acute care hospitals and a sample of primary healthcare centers in Minya were randomly selected for a pre-intervention survey and all patients exiting outpatient clinics on the day of the survey were invited to participate. The same survey methodology was conducted for the post-intervention assessments. Descriptive comparisons were made through three assessments conducted pre- and post-intervention. We quantitated antibiotic prescribing through a survey administered to patients with an ARI exiting outpatient clinics. Additionally, physicians, pharmacists, and patients were interviewed regarding their attitudes and beliefs towards antibiotic prescribing. Finally, physicians were tested on three clinical scenarios (cold, bronchitis, and sinusitis) to measure their knowledge on antibiotic use.ResultsPost-intervention patient exit surveys revealed a 23.1% decrease in antibiotic prescribing for ARIs in this population (83.7 to 64.4%) and physicians and pharmacists self-reported less frequently prescribing antibiotics for ARIs on their follow-up surveys. We also found an increase in correct responses to the clinical scenarios and in attitude and belief scores for physicians, pharmacists, and patients regarding antibiotic use in the post-intervention sample.ConclusionsOverall, the samples surveyed after the community-based educational campaign reported a lower frequency of antibiotic prescribing and improved knowledge and attitudes regarding antibiotic misuse compared to the samples surveyed before the campaign. Ongoing interventions educating providers and patients are needed to decrease antibiotic misuse and reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance in Egypt.

AB BackgroundPeople struggling with reading and writing difficulties may have poor odds of achieving a good and healthy life. Reading and writing difficulties are independent risk factors for not completing education and unemployment, which are essential in order to obtain a good and healthy life. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the association between reading and writing difficulties and self-rated health among adolescents, and to investigate how mental health mediates the association.MethodsA cross-sectional study was performed based on the FOCA cohort, a Danish population-based survey among 9th grade pupils, mainly aged 15- and 16-years old, gathered during the first months of 2017. The study population contained 9748 pupils. The dependent variable was a yes-or-no answer to experiencing limitations in every-day life due to reading and writing difficulties. The independent variable was measured with the SF-36 self-rated health question, dichotomised in high (very good, excellent) and low (good, fair, poor). A logistic regression model was applied.ResultsAmong the study population 953 (9.8%) pupils reported having reading and writing difficulties. The adjusted OR of having a low self-rated health was significantly higher among adolescents with reading and writing difficulties than without (1.37 (95% CI: 1.14-1.66)). Loneliness and perceived stress, explained a minor part of the association, OR attenuated from 1.77 (95% CI: 1.51-2.09) in the crude model to 1.47 (95% CI: 1.23-1.74) in a more adjusted model.ConclusionAdolescents with reading and writing difficulties are not only struggling with reading and writing difficulties but experiencing also low self-rated health. Mental health only explained a minor part of this association. To clarify whether causal relationship between reading and writing difficulties and self-rated health may exist, longitudinal studies are needed. If support for the hypothesised causality is found early identification of reading and writing difficulties is important, to prevent future health inequality in adolescents with reading and writing difficulties.

AB BackgroundHepatitis-E Virus (HEV) infection is endemic in Punjab, India. On 4th April 2013, public officials of Labour Colony, Amritsar reported >20 jaundice cases occurring within several days.MethodsWe performed a case-control study to identify the cause and prevent additional cases of jaundice cases in Amritsar, Punjab, India in 2013.ResultsA total of 159 cases (attack rate 3.6%) and 1 death were identified in Labour and 5 adjoining colonies from January 1 to June 5, 2013. Persons with jaundice were more likely to report foul-smelling piped water (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 4.0, 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2-7.2) and used piped water for drinking (AOR, 5.1; 95% CI, 2.2-11.4) than persons without jaundice. Among 14 cases tested, all had anti-hepatitis E virus IgM, and none had anti-hepatitis A virus IgM. Additionally, 21/23 tap water samples from affected households had detectable fecal coliforms. An environmental investigation found that water pipelines were damaged during sewer construction and likely led to contamination of drinking water with hepatitis E virus.ConclusionsHepatitis E outbreaks are common in India, to curb future outbreaks of hepatitis E; measures to ensure safe drinking water are urgently needed.

AB BackgroundStrong laboratory capacity is essential for detecting and responding to emerging and re-emerging global health threats. We conducted a quantitative laboratory assessment during 2014-2015 in two resource-limited provinces in southern China, Guangxi and Guizhou in order to guide strategies for strengthening core capacities as required by the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005).MethodsWe selected 28 public health and clinical laboratories from the provincial, prefecture and county levels through a quasi-random sampling approach. The 11-module World Health Organization (WHO) laboratory assessment tool was adapted to the local context in China. At each laboratory, modules were scored 0-100% through a combination of paper surveys, in-person interviews, and visual inspections. We defined module scores as strong (>=85%), good (70-84%), weak (50-69%), and very weak (<50%). We estimated overall capacity and compared module scores across the provincial, prefecture, and county levels.ResultsOverall, laboratories in both provinces received strong or good scores for 10 of the 11 modules. These findings were primarily driven by strong and good scores from the two provincial level laboratories; prefecture and county laboratories were strong or good for only 8 and 6 modules, respectively. County laboratories received weak scores in 4 modules. The module, Public Health Functions' (e.g., surveillance and reporting practices) lagged far behind all other modules (mean score=46%) across all three administrative levels. Findings across the two provinces were similar.ConclusionsLaboratories in Guangxi and Guizhou are generally performing well in laboratory capacity as required by IHR. However, we recommend targeted interventions particularly for county-level laboratories, where we identified a number of gaps. Given the importance of surveillance and reporting, addressing gaps in public health functions is likely to have the greatest positive impact for IHR requirements. The quantitative WHO laboratory assessment tool was useful in identifying both comparative strengths and weaknesses. However, prior to future assessments, the tool may need to be aligned with the new WHO IHR monitoring and evaluation framework.

AB More than 75% of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic in origin and a transdisciplinary, multi-sectoral One Health approach is a key strategy for their effective prevention and control. In 2004, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention office in Kenya (CDC Kenya) established the Global Disease Detection Division of which one core component was to support, with other partners, the One Health approach to public health science. After catalytic events such as the global expansion of highly pathogenic H5N1 and the 2006 East African multi-country outbreaks of Rift Valley Fever, CDC Kenya supported key Kenya government institutions including the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries to establish a framework for multi-sectoral collaboration at national and county level and a coordination office referred to as the Zoonotic Disease Unit (ZDU). The ZDU has provided Kenya with an institutional framework to highlight the public health importance of endemic and epidemic zoonoses including RVF, rabies, brucellosis, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, anthrax and other emerging issues such as anti-microbial resistance through capacity building programs, surveillance, workforce development, research, coordinated investigation and outbreak response. This has led to improved outbreak response, and generated data (including discovery of new pathogens) that has informed disease control programs to reduce burden of and enhance preparedness for endemic and epidemic zoonotic diseases, thereby enhancing global health security. Since 2014, the Global Health Security Agenda implemented through CDC Kenya and other partners in the country has provided additional impetus to maintain this effort and Kenya's achievement now serves as a model for other countries in the region.Significant gaps remain in implementation of the One Health approach at subnational administrative levels; there are sustainability concerns, competing priorities and funding deficiencies.

DT Article
ID RIFT-VALLEY FEVER; PUBLIC-HEALTH; INTELLIGENCE SERVICE; OUTBREAK
AB In 2007, South Africa (SA) launched a field epidemiology training program (SAFETP) to enhance its capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to public health threats through training in field epidemiology. The SAFETP began as a collaboration between the SA National Department of Health (NDOH), National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), and the University of Pretoria (UP), with technical and financial support from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In 2010, the CDC in collaboration with the NICD, established a Global Disease Detection (GDD) Center in SA, and the SAFETP became a core activity of the GDD center. Similar to other FETPs globally, the SAFETP is a 2-year, competency-based, applied epidemiology training program, following an apprenticeship model of learn by doing'. SAFETP residents spend approximately 25% of the training in classroom-based didactic learning activities, and 75% in field activities to attain core competencies in epidemiology, biostatistics, outbreak investigation, scientific communication, surveillance evaluation, teaching others, and public health leadership. Residents earn a Master's in Public Health (MPH) degree from UP upon successfully completing a planned research study that serves as a mini-dissertation.Since 2007, SAFETP has enrolled an average of 10 residents each year and, in 2017, enrolled its 11th cohort. During the first 10years of the program, 98 residents have been enrolled, 89% completed the 2-year program, and of these, 76 (87%) earned an MPH degree. Of those completing the program, 88% are employed in the public health sector, and work at NICD, NDOH, Provincial Health Departments, foreign health institutions, or non-governmental organizations. In the first 10years of the program, the combined outputs of trainees included over 130 outbreak investigations, more than 150 abstracts presented at national and international scientific conferences, more than 80 surveillance system evaluations, and more than 45 manuscripts published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. The SAFETP is having an impact in building epidemiology capacity for public health in South Africa. Developing methods to directly link and measure the impact of the program is planned for the future.

AB BackgroundBloodstream infection (BSI) surveillance is essential to characterize the public health threat of bacteremia. We summarize BSI epidemiology in rural Thailand over an eight year period.MethodsPopulation-based surveillance captured clinically indicated blood cultures and associated antimicrobial susceptibility results performed in all 20 hospitals in Nakhon Phanom (NP) and Sa Kaeo (SK) provinces. BSIs were classified as community-onset (CO) when positive cultures were obtained 2days after hospital admission and hospital-onset (HO) thereafter. Hospitalization denominator data were available for incidence estimates for 2009-2014.ResultsFrom 2007 to 2014 a total of 11,166 BSIs were identified from 134,441 blood cultures. Annual CO BSI incidence ranged between 89.2 and 123.5 cases per 100,000 persons in SK and NP until 2011. Afterwards, CO incidence remained stable in SK and increased in NP, reaching 155.7 in 2013. Increases in CO BSI incidence over time were limited to persons aged 50years. Ten pathogens, in rank order, accounted for >65% of CO BSIs in both provinces, all age-groups, and all years: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella non-typhi spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. HO BSI incidence increased in NP from 0.58 cases per 1000 hospitalizations in 2009 to 0.91 in 2014, but were higher (ranging from 1.9 to 2.3) in SK throughout the study period. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production among E. coli isolates and multi-drug resistance among Acinetobacter spp. isolates was common (>25% of isolates), especially among HO cases (>50% of isolates), and became more common over time, while methicillin-resistance among S. aureus isolates (10%) showed no clear trend. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were documented in 2011-2014.ConclusionsPopulation-based surveillance documented CO BSI incidence estimates higher than previously reported from Thailand and the region, with temporal increases seen in older populations. The most commonly observed pathogens including resistance profiles were similar to leading pathogens and resistance profiles worldwide, thus; prevention strategies with demonstrated success elsewhere may prove effective in Thailand.

ID BLOOD-PRESSURE; GLOBAL BURDEN
AB BackgroundNon-communicable diseases (NCDs), mainly cardiovascular diseases, are a substantial cause of mortality in the country of Georgia, accounting for approximately 93% of all deaths (standardized mortality rate 630.7 deaths per 100,000 persons per year) and an important threat to health security. We conducted a nationally representative survey examining the prevalence of NCDs and their risk factors as part of a 2015 Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) serosurvey.MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional serosurvey among adults aged 18years using a stratified, multi-stage cluster design (n=7000). We asked participants standardized questions from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey and the WHO STEPwise approach to Surveillance (STEPS) Survey. We also measured blood pressure and Body Mass Index for each participant. Weighted frequencies were computed for NCD and risk factor prevalence and compared to 2010 STEPS results.ResultsGeorgians reported high rates of smoking, alcohol use, elevated blood pressure, obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. An estimated 27.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 25.3, 28.8%) of adults (51.5% of men and 6.0% of women) reported daily use of tobacco products and 27.5% (95% CI: 25.7, 29.2%) of adults (52.1% of men and 7.0% of women) reported binge drinking within the last 30days. Physical measurements revealed that 37.5% (95% CI: 35.8, 39.3%) of adults had elevated blood pressure and 33.4% (95% CI: 31.8, 35.0%) had obesity. 5.4% (95% CI: 4.6, 6.2%) of adults had self-reported diagnosed diabetes and 15.3% (95% CI: 14.1, 16.6%) had self-reported diagnosed cardiovascular disease. From 2010 to 2015, the prevalence of obesity increased by 8.3 percentage points (95% CI: 5.9, 10.7%; p<0.01) and the prevalence of elevated blood pressure increased by 4.1 percentage points (95% CI: 1.4, 6.8%; p<0.01).ConclusionsGeorgia has a high NCD burden, and results from the survey showed an increase in obesity and elevated blood pressure since 2010. The prevalence of other major NCDs have remained near levels reported in the 2010 STEPs survey. Comprehensive public health interventions are needed to control the heath security threats of major NCDs and their risk factors in the future.

AB The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) underscored the importance of influenza detection and response in China. From 2004, the Chinese National InfluenzaCenter (CNIC) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (USCDC) initiated Cooperative Agreements to build capacity in influenza surveillance in China.From 2004 to 2014, CNIC and USCDC collaborated on the following activities: 1) developing human technical expertise in virology and epidemiology in China; 2) developing a comprehensive influenza surveillance system by enhancing influenza-like illness (ILI) reporting and virological characterization; 3) strengthening analysis, utilization and dissemination of surveillance data; and 4) improving early response to influenza viruses with pandemic potential.Since 2004, CNIC expanded its national influenza surveillance and response system which, as of 2014, included 408 laboratories and 554 sentinel hospitals. With support from USCDC, more than 2500 public health staff from China received virology and epidemiology training, enabling >98% network laboratories to establish virus isolation and/or nucleic acid detection techniques. CNIC established viral drug resistance surveillance and platforms for gene sequencing, reverse genetics, serologic detection, and vaccine strains development. CNIC also built a bioinformatics platform to strengthen data analysis and utilization, publishing weekly on-line influenza surveillance reports in English and Chinese. The surveillance system collects 200,000-400,000 specimens and tests more than 20,000 influenza viruses annually, which provides valuable information for World Health Organization (WHO) influenza vaccine strain recommendations. In 2010, CNIC became the sixth WHO Collaborating Centre for Influenza. CNIC has strengthened virus and data sharing, and has provided training and reagents for other countries to improve global capacity for influenza control and prevention.The collaboration's successes were built upon shared mission and values, emphasis on long-term capacity development and sustainability, and leadership commitment.

TI Community participation in health services development, implementation,
   and evaluation: A systematic review of empowerment, health, community,
   and process outcomes
SO PLOS ONE

DT Review

AB Background
   Community participation is widely believed to be beneficial to the development, implementation and evaluation of health services. However, many challenges to successful and sustainable community involvement remain. Importantly, there is little evidence on the effect of community participation in terms of outcomes at both the community and individual level. Our systematic review seeks to examine the evidence on outcomes of community participation in high and upper-middle income countries.
   Methods and findings
   This review was developed according to PRISMA guidelines. Eligible studies included those that involved the community, service users, consumers, households, patients, public and their representatives in the development, implementation, and evaluation of health services, policy or interventions. We searched the following databases from January 2000 to September 2016: Medline, Embase, Global Health, Scopus, and LILACs. We independently screened articles for inclusion, conducted data extraction, and assessed studies for risk of bias. No language restrictions were made. 27,232 records were identified, with 23,468 after removal of duplicates. Following titles and abstracts screening, 49 met the inclusion criteria for this review. A narrative synthesis of the findings was conducted. Outcomes were categorised as process outcomes, community outcomes, health outcomes, empowerment and stakeholder perspectives. Our review reports a breadth of evidence that community involvement has a positive impact on health, particularly when substantiated by strong organisational and community processes. This is in line with the notion that participatory approaches and positive outcomes including community empowerment and health improvements do not occur in a linear progression, but instead consists of complex processes influenced by an array of social and cultural factors.
   Conclusion
   This review adds to the evidence base supporting the effectiveness of community participation in yielding positive outcomes at the organizational, community and individual level.

TI Potential determinants of health system efficiency: Evidence from Latin
   America and the Caribbean
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CARE; COVERAGE
AB This paper examines the levels of health system efficiency and their possible determinants across Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries using national-level data for those countries, as well as for other emerging and developed countries. The data are analyzed using data envelopment analyses and econometric advances that yield reliable estimations of the relationship between system efficiency and its potential determinants. We find that there is substantial room for efficiency improvements in the health system of most LAC countries. For example, LAC countries could improve life expectancy at birth by about five years on average at current public spending levels if they followed best practices. Furthermore, the paper assesses what factors amenable to policy act as the main possible levers for some countries to be able to translate a given level of health financing into better performance on access to care and health outcomes. Our econometric analyses suggest that efforts to increase health system efficiency could be focused in a few key policy areas associated with broader access to health services and better outcomes. These areas include general governance aspects, in addition to improvements in specific dimensions of the quality of health system institutions, notably stronger reliance on results-based management in the production of healthcare goods and services.

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; SALMONELLA; SHIGELLA
AB Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an emerging public health problem and methods for surveillance are needed. We designed 85 sequence-specific PCR reactions to detect 79 genes or mutations associated with resistance across 10 major antimicrobial classes, with a focus on E. coli. The 85 qPCR assays demonstrated >99.9% concordance with sequencing. We evaluated the correlation between genotypic resistance markers and phenotypic susceptibility results on 239 E. coli isolates. Both sensitivity and specificity exceeded 90% for ampicillin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, gentamicin, amikacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol phenotypic susceptibility results. We then evaluated the assays on direct stool specimens and observed a sensitivity of 97% +/- 5 but, as expected, a lower specificity of 75% +/- 31 versus the genotype of the E. coli cultured from stool. Finally, the assays were incorporated into a convenient TaqMan Array Card (TAC) format. These assays may be useful for tracking AMR in E. coli isolates or directly in stool for targeted testing of the fecal antibiotic resistome.

AB In the Netherlands, toxoplasmosis ranks second in disease burden among foodborne pathogens with an estimated health loss of 1,900 Disability Adjusted Life Years and a cost-of-illness estimated at (sic)45 million annually. Therefore, effective and preferably cost-effective preventive interventions are warranted. Freezing meat intended for raw or undercooked consumption and improving biosecurity in pig farms are promising interventions to prevent Toxoplasma gondii infections in humans. Putting these interventions into practice would expectedly reduce the number of infections; however, the net benefits for society are unknown. Stakeholders bearing the costs for these interventions will not necessary coincide with the ones having the benefits. We performed a Social Cost-Benefit Analysis to evaluate the net value of two potential interventions for the Dutch society. We assessed the costs and benefits of the two interventions and compared them with the current practice of education, especially during pregnancy. A 'minimum scenario' and a 'maximum scenario' was assumed, using input parameters with least benefits to society and input parameters with most benefits to society, respectively. For both interventions, we performed different scenario analyses. The freezing meat intervention was far more effective than the biosecurity intervention. Despite high freezing costs, freezing two meat products: steak tartare and mutton leg yielded net social benefits in both the minimum and maximum scenario, ranging from (sic)10.6 million to (sic)31 million for steak tartare and (sic)0.6 million to (sic)1.5 million for mutton leg. The biosecurity intervention would result in net costs in all scenarios ranging from (sic)1 million to (sic)2.5 million, due to high intervention costs and limited benefits. From a public health perspective (i.e. reducing the burden of toxoplasmosis) and the societal perspective (i.e. a net benefit for the Dutch society) freezing steak tartare and leg of mutton is to be considered.

AB Objective
   The study was conducted to determine the epidemiology and clinical profile of individuals with cleft lip and/or palate (CLP) utilizing specialized academic treatment centres in South Africa's public health sector.
   Materials and methods
   The Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg provided ethical approval for the study. We conducted a retrospective record review of all cases of CLP treated at the specialised academic centres for the two-year period from 1 January 2013 until 31 December 2014. We used a structured, pre-tested record review form to obtain demographic, clinical and treatment information on each CLP case. We used Stata 13 to analyse the data and conducted statistical tests at 5% significance level.
   Results
   We analysed 699 records of individuals with CLP. The estimated prevalence of CLP in the South African public health sector was 0.3 per 1000 live births, with provincial variation of 0.1/1000 to 1.2/1000. The distribution of clefts was: 35.3% cleft palate; 34.6% cleft lip and palate; 19.0% cleft lip and other cleft anomalies at 2%. Of the total number of CLP, 47.5% were male and 52.5% female, and this difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). The majority of clefts occurred on the left for males (35.5%) and palate for females (43.4%), with a male predominance of unilateral cleft lip and palate (53.3%).
   Conclusion
   The study findings should inform the implementation of South Africa's planned birth defect surveillance system and health service planning for individuals with CLP.

AB BackgroundSuicide is a major public health problem, and it remains unclear which processes link suicidal ideation and plans to the act of suicide. Growing evidence shows that the majority of suicidal patients diagnosed with major depression or bipolar disorder report repetitive suicide-related images and thoughts (suicidal intrusions). Various studies showed that vividness of negative as well as positive intrusive images may be reduced by dual task (e.g. eye movements) interventions taxing the working memory. We propose that a dual task intervention may also reduce frequency and intensity of suicidal imagery and may be crucial in preventing the transition from suicidal ideation and planning to actual suicidal behaviour. This study aims a) to evaluate the effectiveness of an Eye Movement Dual Task (EMDT) add-on intervention targeting suicidal imagery in depressed patients, b) to explore the role of potential moderators and mediators in explaining the effect of EMDT, and c) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of EMDT.MethodsWe will conduct a multi-center randomized clinical trial (RCT) evaluating the effects of EMDT in combination with usual care (n=45) compared to usual care alone (n=45). Participants will fill in multiple online batteries of self-report questionnaires as well as complete a semi-structured interview (Intrusion Interview), and online computer tasks. The primary outcome is the frequency and intrusiveness of suicidal imagery. Furthermore, the vividness, emotionality, and content of the suicidal intrusions are evaluated; secondary outcomes include: suicidal behaviour and suicidal ideation, severity of depression, psychological symptoms, rumination, and hopelessness. Finally, potential moderators and mediators are assessed.DiscussionIf proven effective, EMDT can be added to regular treatment to reduce the frequency and vividness of suicidal imagery.Trial registrationThe study has been registered on October 17th, 2018 at the Netherlands Trial Register, part of the Dutch Cochrane Centre (NTR7563).

AB BackgroundSelf-rated health is widely considered a good indicator of morbidity and mortality but its validity for health equity analysis and public health policies in Italy is often disregarded by policy-makers. This study had three objectives. O1: To explore response distribution across dimensions of age, chronic health conditions, functional limitations and SRH in Italy. O2: To explore associations between SRH and healthcare demand in Italy. O3: To explore the association between SRH and household income.MethodsCross-sectional data were obtained from the 2015 Health Interview Survey (HIS) conducted in Italy. Italian respondents (n=20,814) were included in logistic regression analyses. O1: associations of chronic health conditions (CHC), functional limitations (FL), and age with self-rated health (SRH) were tested. O2: associations of CHC, FL, and SRH with hospitalisation (H), medical specialist consultations (MSC), and medicine use (MU) were tested. O3: associations of SRH and CHC with household income (PEI) were tested.ResultsO1: CHC, FL, and age had an independent summative effect on respondents' SRH. O2: SRH predicted H and MSC more than CHC; age and MU were more strongly correlated than SRH and MU. O3: SRH and PEI were significantly correlated, while we found no correlation between CHC and PEI.ConclusionsDrawing from our results and the relevant literature, we suggest that policy-makers in Italy could use SRH measures to: 1) predict healthcare demand for effective allocation of resources; 2) assess subjective effectiveness of treatments; and 3) understand geosocial pockets of health inequity that require special attention.

AB BackgroundThe recent Zika virus (ZIKAV) epidemics disclosed a major public health threat and a scientific and technological (S&T) challenge. The lessons learned from the S&T response of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) countries are critical to inform further research and guide scientific investments. The present study aimed to assess how new S&T knowledge produced and disseminated regionally can contribute to address global health challenges.MethodsScientometric and social network analysis methods were used to assess the LAC scientific contribution and potential technological development on ZIKAV up to December 2017. ZIKAV-related publications were retrieved from the Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed databases. Regionally published articles were obtained from SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online) and LILACS (Literature in the Health Sciences in Latin America and the Caribbean) databases. Patent registries were retrieved using Orbit Intelligence and Derwent Innovation. Records from each database were individually downloaded, integrated, standardized and analyzed.ResultsWe retrieved 5421 ZIKAV-related publications, revealing a sharp increase from 2015 onwards. LAC countries accounted for 20% of all publications and Brazil was among the top three most central countries in the global network for ZIKAV research. A total of 274 patent families backed up by experimental evidence were retrieved. Only 5% were filed by LAC assignees, all of them based in Brazil. The largest contribution of LAC research was on the clinical manifestations of the ZIKAV infection, along with vector control, which was also the main focusof patents.ConclusionsOur analysis offered a comprehensive overview of ZIKAV's research and development and showed that (i) LAC countries had a key role in generating and disseminating scientific knowledge on ZIKAV; (ii) LAC countries have expressively contributed to research on ZIKAV clinical manifestations; (iii) the Brazilian scientific community was potentially very effective in knowledge sharing and diffusion in the ZIKAV research network; (iv) Brazil was the single LAC country filing patents, mostly represented by independent inventors and low-tech patents. The paper advocates the need for a continued interdisciplinary approach to improve LAC countries ability to prevent, prepare for and control future outbreaks.

AB BackgroundGrowth monitoring is used to assess the growth rate of a child by periodic and frequent anthropometric measurements in comparison to a standard. However, since the practice has been poor in Ethiopia, this study aimed to assess it and its associated factors among health workers in North Gondar zone, northwest Ethiopia.MethodsAn institution-based mixed study was conducted from April 1 to May 7, 2017, among 500 health workers. The multistage sampling technique was used to select participants. A structured questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data, while non-participant observation and in-depth interviews were used to generate qualitative information. Qualitative data were coded, grouped, and discussed using the identified themes. A binary logistic regression was fitted, odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was estimated to identify the predictors of growth monitoring practice, and qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis.ResultsGrowth monitoring practice among health workers was 50.4% (95% CI: 45, 55). Work experience (AOR=4.27, 95%CI: 1.70, 10.72), availability of growth monitoring materials (AOR=1.52, 95%CI: 1.05, 2.20), attitude (AOR=0.68, 95%CI: 0.47, 0.98), midwifery occupation (AOR=0.42, 95%CI: 0.19, 0.94), and diploma level qualification (AOR=2.20, 95%CI: 1.09, 4.45) were statistically significantly associated with growth monitoring practice.ConclusionIn this study, growth monitoring practice among health workers was lower than those of most studies. Jobs, educational status, work experience, attitude, and availability of materials were significantly associated with growth monitoring practices. Therefore, giving training to health extension and less experienced staff about growth monitoring, and providing growth monitoring equipment are important to improve health workers growth monitoring practices.

AB BackgroundHealthcare associated infection (HCAI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. In recent years, there have been high profile successes in infection prevention control (IPC), such as the dramatic reductions in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infections (which is viewed as one proxy indicator of overall harm) and Clostridium difficile in the UK. Nevertheless, HCAI remains a costly burden to health services, a source of concern to patients and the public and at present, is receiving priority from policy makers as it contributes to the global threat of antimicrobial resistance.MethodsThe study involves qualitative case studies within isolation settings at two National Health Service (NHS) district general hospitals (DGHs) in Wales, in the UK. The 18-month study incorporates Manchester Patient Safety Framework (MaPSaF) workshops with health workers and other hospital staff, in depth interviews with patients and their relative / informal carer, health workers and hospital staff, and periods of hospital ward observation.DiscussionThe present study aims to investigate the ways in which engagement of health workers with IPC strategies and principles, shape and inform organisational patient safety culture within the context of isolation in surgical, medical and admission hospital settings; and vice-versa. We want to understand the meaning of IPC ownership' for health workers; the ways in which IPC is promoted, how IPC teams operate as new challenges arise, how their effectiveness is assessed and the positioning of IPC within the broader context of organisational patient safety culture, within hospital isolation settings.

AB BackgroundA variety of antenatal care models have been implemented in low and middle-income countries over the past decades, as proposed by the World Health Organisation (WHO). One such model is the 2001 Focused Antenatal Care (FANC) programme. FANC recommended a minimum of four visits for women with uncomplicated pregnancies and emphasised quality of care to improve both maternal and neonatal outcomes. Malawi adopted FANC in 2003, however, up to now no study has been done to analyse the model's performance with regards to antenatal care service quality and utilisation patterns.MethodsThe paper is based on data pooled from three comparable nationally representative Malawi Demographic and Health Survey (MDHS) datasets (2000, 2004 and 2010). The DHS collects data on demographics, socio-economic indicators, antenatal care, and the fertility history of reproductive women aged between 15 and 49. We pooled a sample of 8545 women who had a live birth in the last 5 years prior to each survey. We measure the impact of FANC on early access to care, underutilisation of care and quality of care with interrupted time series analysis. This method enables us to track changes in both levels and the trends of our outcome variables.ResultsWe find that FANC is associated with earlier access to care. However, it has also been associated with unintended increases in underutilisation. We see no change in the quality of ANC services.ConclusionIn light of the WHO 2016 ANC guidelines, which recommend an increase of visits to eight, these results are important. Given that we find underutilisation when the benchmark is set at four visits, eight visits are unlikely to be feasible in low-resource settings.

ID LENGTH
AB BackgroundIn 2010, Israel intensified its adoption of Procedure-Related Group (PRG) basedhospital payments, a local version of DRG(Diagnosis-related group). PRGs were created for certain procedures by clinical fields such as urology, orthopedics, and ophthalmology. Non-procedural hospitalizations and other specific procedures continued to be paid for as per-diems (PD). Whether this payment reform affected inpatient activities, measured by the number of discharges and average length of stay (ALoS), is unclear.MethodsWe analyzed inpatient data provided by the Ministry of Health from all 29 public hospitals in Israel. Our observations were hospital wards for the years 2008-2015, as proxies to clinical fields. We investigated the impact of this reform at the ward level using difference-in-differences analyses among procedural wards. Those for which PRG codes were created were treatment wards, other procedural wards served as controls. We further refined the analysis of effects on each ward separately.ResultsDischarges increased more in the wards that were part of the control group than in the treatment wards as a group. However, a refined analysis of each treated ward separately reveals that discharges increased in some, but decreased in other wards. ALoS decreased more in treatment wards. Difference-in-differences results could not suggest causality between the PRG payment reform and changes in inpatient activity.ConclusionsFactors that may have hampered the effects of the reform are inadequate pricing of procedures, conflicting incentives created by other co-existing hospital-payment components, such as caps and retrospective subsidies, and the lack of resources to increase productivity. Payment reforms for health providers such as hospitals need to take into consideration the entire provider market, available resources, other - potentially conflicting - payment components, and the various parties involved and their interests.

AB BackgroundHepatitis C virus infection (HCV) is a communicable disease of increasing global importance with 1.75 million new infections and 400,000 related deaths annually. Until recently, treatment options have had low uptake and most infected people remain untreated. New Direct Acting Antiviral medications can clear the virus in around 95% of cases, with few side-effects. These medications are restricted in most countries but freely accessible in Australia, yet most people still remain untreated. This study applies a cross-sectional research design to investigate the socio-spatial distribution of HCV in South Australia, to identify vulnerable populations, and examine epidemiological factors to potentially inform future targeted strategies for improved treatment uptake.MethodHCV surveillance data were sourced from South Australia's Communicable Diseases Control Branch and socio-economic population data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics from January 2010 to December 2016 inclusive. HCV cases were spatially mapped at postcode level. Multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors of demographic risks for HCV notification and notification source.ResultsHCV notifications (n=3356) were seven times more likely to be from people residing in the poorest areas with high rates of non-employment (75%; n=1876) and injecting drug use (74%; n=1862) reported. Notifications among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were around six times that of non-Indigenous people. HCV notifications negatively correlated (Spearman's rho -0.426; p<0.001) with socio-economic status (residential postcode socio-economic resources Index). History of imprisonment independently predicted HCV diagnoses in lesser economically-resourced areas (RR1.5; p<0.001). Independent predictors of diagnosis elsewhere than in general practices were non-employment (RR 4.6; p=0.028), being male (RR 2.5; p<0.001), and younger than mean age at diagnosis (RR 2.1; p=0.006).ConclusionsMost people diagnosed with HCV were from marginalised sub-populations. Given general practitioners are pivotal to providing effective HCV treatment for many people in Australia a most concerning finding was that non-employed people were statistically less likely to be diagnosed by general practitioners. These findings highlight a need for further action aimed at improving healthcare access and treatment uptake to help reduce the burden of HCV for marginalised people, and progress the vision of eliminating HCV as a major public health threat.

AB BackgroundDespite evolving evidence of the health and economic benefits of active transportation (AT) to work, few studies have examined the determinants of AT in large organizations with multiple worksites nor how trends in commuting change over time.MethodsThe data were obtained from the U.S. Department of the Interior Employee Commuting Census of 2010 (n=23,230), and 2012-2016 (n=21,725-25,974). The respondents were grouped into four commuting categories: non-active mode, walking, biking, and mixed-mode. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was utilized to examine the correlates of choosing AT to work for the 2010 data. Next, a repeated cross-sectional analysis was completed for all six years of data.ResultsIn 2010, AT modes were only chosen by approximately 10% of respondents. Employees who lived farther from work and did not have a public transit station within 0.5miles from home were generally less likely to choose AT. Respondents working in non-metro workplaces were less likely to bike or take mixed-modes to work, but more likely to walk. Men were more likely to choose AT modes, particularly biking. Respondents aged 30yrs. were less likely to bike than those 31 to 40yrs., but more likely than those 61yrs. In 2010, the number of respondents that walked was higher, and biked and took mixed-modes was lower when compared to 2016, while the choice to take mixed-modes was higher in 2012 and 2013 when compared to 2016. Daily commuting distances in 2016 tended to be lower than 2010 and 2012, and higher than 2013. However, overall AT choice and commute distance remained reasonably stable over time.ConclusionsRespondents who lived close to their workplace and a public transportation station, worked in a metro location, were male and younger were more likely to choose AT modes to work. The results provide insight for the U.S. Department of the Interior and other large organizations to develop intervention strategies that support AT to work. Further research is warranted to understand the concurrent individual, social, and environmental barriers and facilitators for choosing AT to work.

TI Applying a deviance framework to understand modern contraceptive use in
   sub-Saharan Africa
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CONTEXTUAL INFLUENCES; FERTILITY; ETHIOPIA; HEALTH
AB Increasing modern contraceptive use is important for improving maternal and child health and achieving economic growth and development goals. However, pervasive high unmet need for modern contraceptives in sub-Saharan Africa warrants new understandings of the drivers of modern contraceptive use. A deviance approach (i.e., examining how women's experiences/characteristics differ from other women in their community) provides an innovative framework for capturing heterogeneity among women in a community. This framework can inform public health programming by both exploring how women avoid adverse health outcomes and understanding the needs of harder-to-reach populations who may experience health risks, despite living in communities where others do not experience vulnerability. Using data from Demographic and Health Surveys from 29 sub-Saharan African countries, we examine how a woman's deviation from community norms around socioeconomic characteristics and gender and fertility norms and behaviors is associated with modern contraceptive use. Random-effects logistic regression models were fitted for each country to examine relationships between modern contraceptive use and deviance. Some deviance factors were associated with modern contraceptive use in only a few countries, while others were significant across many countries. Cross-country consistency in the direction of the relationship between deviance and modern contraceptive use varied by the specific deviance factor, with some relationships being consistent across countries, and other relationships being more varied. For example, having more education than the community norm was associated with increased modern contraceptive use across countries; however, marrying older than other women in the community was associated with an increase in modern contraceptive use in some countries and a decrease in others. More work is needed to understand the role of deviance on modern contraceptive use; however, this study suggests that using context-specific deviance approaches may be important for further elucidating experiences of modern contraceptive use.

TI Costs associated with policies regarding alcohol use during pregnancy:
   Results from 1972-2015 Vital Statistics
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID DRUG-USE
AB Background and objective
   As of 2016, 43 US states have policies regarding alcohol use during pregnancy. A recent study found that out of eight state-level alcohol/pregnancy policies, six are significantly associated with poorer birth outcomes, and two are not associated with any outcomes. Here we estimate the excess numbers of low birthweight (LBW) and preterm births (PTB) related to these policies and their associated additional costs in the first year of life.
   Methods
   Cost study using birth certificate data for 155,446,714 singleton live births in the United States between 1972-2015. Exposures were state- and month/year-specific indicators of having each of eight alcohol/pregnancy policies in place. Outcomes were excess numbers of LBW and PTB and associated costs in the first year of life. Fixed effects regressions with state-specific time trends were used for statistical analyses in 2018.
   Results
   In 2015, policies mandating warning signs were associated with an excess of 7,375 LBW; policies defining alcohol use during pregnancy as child abuse/neglect were associated with an excess of 12,372 PTB; these excess adverse outcomes are associated with additional costs of $151,928,002 and $582,698,853 in the first year of life, respectively.
   Conclusions
   Multiple state-level alcohol pregnancy policies lead to increased prevalence of LBW and PTB, which cost hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Policymakers should consider adverse public health impacts of alcohol/pregnancy policies before expanding extant policies to new substances or adopting existing policies in new states.

AB The aim of this study was to analyze the value and meanings that dental surgeons attribute to the Primary Health Care setting, where health promotion is encouraged over a mechanistic performance of procedures. A qualitative study, involving ten Brazilian dental surgeons working in Primary Care in 2016, was designed. In-depth semi-structured interviews were performed, with all interviews recorded, transcribed and subsequently submitted to Qualitative Content Analysis. Despite the Healthcare Promotion model proposed by the Brazilian oral health policy, dental surgeons demonstrated preferences for private and traditional dental practices. These characteristics are counterproductive in public oral health services, which aim to achieve collective health benefits. Traditional practice is based upon a specific and restricted focus, as opposed to overall patient care, hence maintaining the original professional identity, ruled by manual procedures, while demonstrating scientifically fragile understanding of disease processes. Despite the implementation of public service models that aim at change, counterproductive characteristics associated with the deeply rooted traditional management strategies were evidenced.

AB BackgroundEvaluation of complex interventions (CI) is challenging for health researchers and requires innovative approaches. The objective of this work is to present the main methods used to evaluate CI.MethodsA systematic review of the scientific literature was conducted to identify methods used for the evaluation of CI. We searched MEDLINE via PubMed databases for articles including an evaluation or a pilot study of a complex intervention, published in a ten-year period. Key-words of this research were (complex intervention* AND evaluation).ResultsAmong 445 identified articles, 100 research results or protocols were included. Among them, 5 presented 2 different types of design in the same publication, thus our work included 105 designs. Individual randomized controlled trials (IRCT) represented 21.9% (n=23) of evaluation designs, randomized clinical trials adaptations 44.8% (n=47), quasi -experimental designs and cohort study 19.0% (n=20), realist evaluation 6.7% (n=7) and other cases studies and other approaches 8.6% (n=9). A process/mechanisms analysis was included in 80% (n=84) of these designs.ConclusionA range of methods can be used successively or combined at various steps of the evaluation approach. A framework is proposed to situate each of the designs with respect to evaluation questions. The growing interest of researchers in alternative methods and the development of their use must be accompanied by conceptual and methodological research in order to more clearly define their principles of use.

AB BackgroundIncreasingly the population is eating meals and snacks prepared outside the home, especially younger adults. Takeaway foods can be energy-dense, high in saturated fat and sodium, and deleterious to health. Extending studies examining the barriers to healthy eating, this paper explores strategies employed by young adults who report reducing consumption of unhealthy takeaway foods.MethodsYoung adults aged 18 to 35years in paid employment were recruited to participate in eight semi-structured focus groups. In response to initial findings, recruitment for the final four groups refocused on participants who either wanted, were in the process of, or had changed their takeaway food habits. Focus group recordings were transcribed verbatim and coded by two researchers for recurrent themes using an inductive method.ResultsForty-eight participants with a mean BMI of 23.4kg/m(2) and mean age of 25years took part, of which 34 were female, and 27 were born outside Australia. Four broad strategies emerged: altering cognitions about consumption/reduction of takeaway food; practical changes to behaviours; finding external support; and, reconfiguring social events. In detail, participants cognitively recast takeaway food consumption as negative (expensive and unhealthy) and reducing consumption of such foods or consuming healthy alternatives as a (positive) self-care action. Setting goals and making personal rules around consumption, and consciously making practical changes, such as planning for food shopping, were other strategies. Externally derived support including supportive food environments and friends and family passively reduced exposure to unhealthy takeaway food. Finally, some participants actively created social environments supportive of healthy choices.ConclusionsOur participants reported strategies they believed led to them successfully reduce their takeaway food consumption by matching the attractions (e.g., convenience) and countering apparent disincentives for reducing consumption (e.g., losing a reward) of takeaway food. They reported eschewing more short-term rewards and costs, to prioritise their health, believing that avoiding these foods would benefit them personally and financially. The identified strategies are consistent with documented techniques for successful behaviour change and corresponded to all levels in the social-ecological model from intrapersonal factors to public policy. The findings could underpin health promotion strategies to support this at-risk group.

AB Purpose
   To examine the association between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and early sexual initiation.
   Methods
   We analyzed retrospective data of (n = 241) Black women recruited from public STD clinics in Baltimore, MD. Multinomial logistic and linear regression models estimated associations between ACEs and early sexual initiation; contextual variables at initiation were examined as mediators.
   Results
   Twelve percent of our sample reported very early sexual initiation (11-12 years) and 29% reported early sexual initiation (13-14 years). Each additional ACE reported was associated with greater risk of very early sexual initiation (RRR = 1.49; 95% CI: 1.23,1.80). Specifically, emotional abuse (RRR = 3.71; 95% CI: 1.55,8.89), physical abuse (RRR = 9.45; 95% CI: 3.56,25.12), sexual abuse (RRR = 8.60; 95% CI: 3.29,22.51), witnessing maternal abuse (RRR = 5.56; 95% CI: 2.13,14.52), and household substance misuse (RRR = 3.21; 95% CI: 1.38,7.47) at or before the age of 18 were associated with very early sexual initiation. As for context of initiation, age at sexual initiation was younger if the man at initiation was a non-partner (beta = -0.88; 95% CI:-1.36,-0.40), was. 3 years older (beta = -1.30; 95% CI:-.82,-0.77), had pressured or forced sexual intitiation (beta = -1.09; 95% CI:-1.58,-0.59), and was under the influence of drugs/alcohol (beta = -0.97; 95% CI:-1.62,-0.32). Contextual variables at first sex, including being pressured or forced, and the man being. 3 years older fully mediated the association between ACEs and early sexual initiation.
   Conclusions
   This study highlights the critical need to develop interventions that reduce the impact of ACEs on women's health and delay age at sexual initiation. Health education efforts are needed for clinicians and parents to identify and prevent childhood abuse and to identify and report sexual coercion and abuse for girls and adolescents.

AB BackgroundBlood transfusion is one of the routine therapeutic interventions in hospitals that can be lifesaving. However, this intervention is related to several transfusion-related infections. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is one of the major public health problems associated with blood transfusion. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to estimate seroprevalence and trend of human immunodeficiency virus among blood donors in Ethiopia.MethodsStudies on the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus among blood donors published until 2017 were accessed by conducting a detailed search on PubMed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, EMBASE and CINAHL databases using the keywords:-Seroprevalence AND trend AND HIV OR human AND immunodeficiency AND virus OR human immunodeficiency virus AND blood donors OR blood donors OR Ethiopia. The quality of each article was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Meta-analysis was carried out using a random-effects method. All statistical analyses were done using STATA version 11 software.ResultThe estimated pooled seroprevalence of human immunodeficiency virus among blood donors in Ethiopia was 2.69% (95% CI (1.79-3.58%)). The overall seroprevalence of human immunodeficiency virus infection showed a significant decline trend from 2004 to 2016.ConclusionThe overall seroprevalence of human immunodeficiency virus among blood donors in Ethiopia was high. Routine screening of donor blood for transfusion-transmissible infections is essential for ensuring the safety of blood transfusion.

AB BackgroundEnsuring that countries have adequate research capacities is essential for an effective and efficient response to infectious disease outbreaks. The need for ethical principles and values embodied in international research ethics guidelines to be upheld during public health emergencies is widely recognized. Public health officials, researchers and other concerned stakeholders also have to carefully balance time and resources allocated to immediate treatment and control activities, with an approach that integrates research as part of the outbreak response. Under such circumstances, research ethics preparedness constitutes an important foundation for an effective response to infectious disease outbreaks and other health emergencies.Main textA two-day workshop was convened in March 2018 by the World Health Organisation Global Health Ethics Team and the African coaLition for Epidemic Research, Response and Training, with representatives of National Ethics Committees, to identify practical processes and procedures related to ethics review preparedness. The workshop considered five areas where work might be undertaken to facilitate rapid and sound ethics review: preparing national ethics committees for outbreak response; pre-review of protocols; multi-country review; coordination between national ethics committees and other key stakeholders; data and benefit sharing; and export of samples to third countries.In this paper, we present the recommendations that resulted from the workshop. In particular, the participants recommended that Ethics Committees would develop a formal national standard operating procedure for emergency response ethical review; that there is a need to clarify the terminology and expectations of pre-review of generic protocols and agree upon specific terminology; that there is a need to explore mechanisms for multi-country emergency ethical consultation, and to establish procedures for communication between national ethics committees and other oversight bodies and public health authorities. In addition, it was suggested that ethics committees should request from researchers, at a minimum, a preliminary data sharing and sample sharing plan that outlines the benefit to the population from which data and samples are to be drawn. This should be followed in due time by a full plan.ConclusionIt is hoped that the national ethics committees, supported by the WHO, relevant collaborative research consortia and external funding agencies, will work towards bringing these recommendations into practice, for supporting the conduct of effective research during outbreaks.

AB BackgroundAmong cervical cancer patients in the U.S., a disproportionate number are Hispanics/Latinos. Also, about a third of patients diagnosed with cervical cancer annually in Mexico die of the disease. Vaccines are available to protect against HPV, the cause of cervical cancer.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted with 200 mothers of Mexican origin in the U.S. Midwest and Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico. Based on a validated bilingual questionnaire, this study elicited information about knowledge and attitudes regarding HPV vaccination and cervical cancer.ResultsMothers living in Mexico showed better knowledge about HPV and HPV vaccine (77.8%) than participants living in the U.S. (48%) p<.0001. Logistic regression revealed that receiving information about the HPV vaccine from medical providers was a significant predictor of mothers' willingness to vaccinate their children.ConclusionsA need for increasing public health education of Mexican mothers in the Midwest on HPV/HPV vaccination, may lead to improving utilization of the vaccination and eventually a reduction of cervical cancer. HPV vaccination for boys is critical for reducing the risk of transmission to sexual partners and decreasing the risk of HPV- related diseases in the population. Therefore, we recommend increasing efforts to vaccine boys and increasing knowledge that boys must also be vaccinated, especially in Mexico.

TI Geo-visual integration of health outcomes and risk factors using excess

   and sociodemographic determinants in Ghana
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH

DT Article
DE Sociodemographic determinants; Excess risk maps; Conditioned choropleth

ID URBAN; AREA
AB BackgroundRecently, exploratory spatial data analysis is for problem solving, hypothesis generation and knowledge construction. Unless geographically weighted regression, sophisticated spatial regression models best control spatial heterogeneity in outcomes and the associated risk factors but cannot visually display and identify areas of the significant associations. The under-utilised excess risk maps (ERMs) and conditioned choropleth maps (CCMs) are useful to address this issue and simplify epidemiological information to public health stakeholders without much statistical backgrounds. Using malaria and sociodemographic determinants in Ghana as case study, this paper applied ERM and CCM techniques for identification of areas at elevated risk of disease-risk factor co-location.MethodWe computed and smoothed mean district-specific malaria incidences for the period 2010 to 2014 as a function of sociodemographic determinants. The spatial distribution of malaria was investigated through global and local spatial autocorrelations, and the association with sociodemographic risk factors evaluated with bivariate correlations. ERMs and CCMs were produced for the statistically significant risk factors.ResultsThe incidence of malaria increased over time with cluster locations detected, predominantly at the northern parts but later few spread to the middle parts of the country. Our results suggested that with respect to sociodemographic determinants, district variations in malaria rates might be explained by inequalities in seven sociodemographics, including an unexpected significant negative association with non-religious affiliation. The sociodemographics had positive spatial autocorrelations, exhibited statistically significant interactions and the strongest was observed in urbanisation-basic education correlation (p< 0.01, r = +0.969). The ERMs and CCMs specifically identified locations with lower or higher than expected rates with respect to particular risk factor(s) where improving risk factor(s) such as employment-to-population ratio in rural areas, basic education could have cascade effects to reduce the expected malaria incidence in endemic areas.ConclusionGhana remains malaria hyperendemic region with district-level spatial heterogeneity. Significant association between malaria and sociodemographics was detected and the ERMs and CCMs geo-visually pinpointed locations of these significant associations. To complement sophisticated spatial regression models, the easily interpretable ERMs and CCMs could be used to specify where disease-risk factor associations are significant, simplifying complex spatial epidemiological information for efficient public health administration.

TI Evaluating changes in electronic gambling machine policy on user losses
   in an Australian jurisdiction
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH

ID ACCESSIBILITY; PREVALENCE; VICTORIA
AB BackgroundElectronic gambling machines (EGMs) are in casinos and community venues (hotels and clubs) in all jurisdictions in Australia, except Western Australia (only in casino). EGMs have a range of features that can affect how people gamble, which can influence losses incurred by users. The Northern Territory Government recently changed two EGM policies - the introduction of note acceptors on EGMs in community venues, and an increase in the cap from 10 to 20 EGMs in hotels and 45 to 55 in clubs. This study evaluates two changes in EGM policy on user losses in community venues, and tracks changes in user losses per adult, EGM gambler, and EGM problem/moderate risk gambler between 2005 and 2015.MethodsTrends in venue numbers, EGM numbers, user losses and user losses per EGM by venue type and size are presented to determine if EGM policy changes affected user losses. Data from the 2005 and 2015 NT gambling surveys are used to determine EGM user losses per adult, per EGM gambler, and per EGM problem and/or moderate risk gambler, with several assumptions applied.ResultsFrom 2010 (post smoking ban) to 2013 real user losses were stagnant, but from 2013 to 2017, real user losses in community venues increased 19, 9, 8 and 5% per annum, with increases higher in clubs and hotels with the maximum allowable number of EGMs. Over the same period user losses in the two casinos declined by 13%. Between 2005 and 2015, estimated user losses per EGM problem/moderate risk and problem gambler increased by 5 and 34% respectively.ConclusionsThe analysis demonstrates that reductions in how much money gamblers can insert into an EGM (load-up limit), and/or the abolition of note acceptors, and reductions in the number of EGMs in venues is likely to reduce harm from EGM use. Given the demonstrated inability for Australian jurisdictions to identify and implement effective harm prevention and minimisation interventions, a national approach to gambling regulation in Australia may be desirable. Similarly, national co-ordination of research, particularly on EGMs and online betting is required to better understand changes in gambling policy on related harms.

AB BackgroundAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) of bacterial pathogens is an emerging public health threat. This threat extends to pets as it also compromises our ability to treat their infections. Surveillance programs in the United States have traditionally focused on collecting data from food animals, foods, and people. The Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network (Vet-LIRN), a national network of 45 veterinary diagnostic laboratories, tested the antimicrobial susceptibility of clinically relevant bacterial isolates from animals, with companion animal species represented for the first time in a monitoring program. During 2017, we systematically collected and tested 1968 isolates. To identify genetic determinants associated with AMR and the potential genetic relatedness of animal and human strains, whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on 192 isolates: 69Salmonella enterica (all animal sources), 63 Escherichia coli (dogs), and 60Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (dogs).ResultsWe found that most Salmonella isolates (46/69, 67%) had no known resistance genes. Several isolates from both food and companion animals, however, showed genetic relatedness to isolates from humans. For pathogenic E. coli, no resistance genes were identified in 60% (38/63) of the isolates. Diverse resistance patterns were observed, and one of the isolates had predicted resistance to fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins, important antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine. For S. pseudintermedius, we observed a bimodal distribution of resistance genes, with some isolates having a diverse array of resistance mechanisms, including the mecA gene (19/60, 32%).ConclusionThe findings from this study highlight the critical importance of veterinary diagnostic laboratory data as part of any national antimicrobial resistance surveillance program. The finding of some highly resistant bacteria from companion animals, and the observation of isolates related to those isolated from humans demonstrates the public health significance of incorporating companion animal data into surveillance systems. Vet-LIRN will continue to build the infrastructure to collect the data necessary to perform surveillance of resistant bacteria as part of fulfilling its mission to advance human and animal health. A One Health approach to AMR surveillance programs is crucial and must include data from humans, animals, and environmental sources to be effective.

AB Background
   One of the key strategies for reducing maternal and perinatal morbidities and mortalities is the provision of skilled intrapartum care. While cesarean section is an important emergency obstetric intervention for saving the lives of mothers and newborns, a study comparing the prevalence of cesarean delivery is not sufficiently available in Ethiopia. This study aimed at assessing the prevalence and associated factors of cesarean delivery among women who gave birth at hospitals in Dessie town, Northeast Ethiopia.
   Methods
   A facility based cross-sectional study was conducted between July and October 2013. A total of 520 women who gave birth in four hospitals (public =1, private = 3) were interviewed. Face-to-face interviews using a pre-tested and structured questionnaire were conducted for primary data collection. Additionally, patients' charts were reviewed to collect mothers' clinical data. Bivariate and multiple logistic regressions analyses were conducted. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were computed and a P-value of less than 0.05 was taken to declare the level of significance.
   Results
   A total of 512 mothers were included in the final analysis (response rate = 98.4%), the prevalence of cesarean delivery was found to be 47.6% (95% CI: 44.3, 51.1), While 46 (18.2%) of the procedure conducted in public and 198 (76.1%) were in private hospitals. Partograph monitoring [AOR = 3.84 95%Cl: 2.24, 6.59], oxytocin administration [AOR = 4. 80 95`)/Cl: 2.87-8.02], previous cesarean delivery [AOR = 2.86 95`)/Cl: 1.64-5.01] and place of delivery being a private hospital [AOR = 6.79 95`)/Cl: 4.18-11.01)] were associated with cesarean delivery.
   Conclusion
   The prevalence of cesarean delivery was found to be high, and was significantly higher in private hospitals than a public facility. There is a need to conduct cesarean delivery audits to appropriately utilize scarce resources. Further an in-depth exploration of the experiences of women with cesarean delivery is necessary.

AB BackgroundFatigue is a major symptom of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). There is some evidence that physical activity (PA) may be effective in reducing RA fatigue. However, few PA interventions have been designed to manage fatigue and there is limited evidence of end-user input into intervention development. The aim of this research was to co-design an intervention to support self-management of RA fatigue through modifying PA.MethodsA series of studies used mixed methodological approaches to co-design a fatigue management intervention focused on modifying PA based on UK Medical Research Council guidance, and informed by the Behaviour Change Wheel theoretical framework. Development was based on existing evidence, preferences of RA patients and rheumatology healthcare professionals, and practical issues regarding intervention format, content and implementation.ResultsThe resulting group-based intervention consists of seven sessions delivered by a physiotherapist over 12weeks. Each session includes an education and discussion session followed by supervised PA chosen by the participant. The intervention is designed to support modification and maintenance of PA as a means of managing fatigue. This is underpinned by evidence-based behaviour change techniques that might support changes in PA behaviour. Intervention delivery is interactive and aims to enhance capability, opportunity and motivation for PA.ConclusionThis study outlines stages in the systematic development of a theory-based intervention designed through consultation with RA patients and healthcare professionals to reduce the impact of RA fatigue. The feasibility of future evaluation of the intervention should now be determined.

AB BackgroundAmong community-dwelling older adults, frailty is highly prevalent and recognized as a major public health concern. To prevent frailty it is important to identify those at risk of becoming frail, but at present, no accepted screening procedure is available.MethodsThe screening process developed as part of the PERSSILAA project is a two-step screening pathway. First, older adults are asked to complete a self-screening questionnaire to assess their general health status and their level of decline on physical, cognitive and nutritional domains. Second, older adults who, according to step one, are at risk of becoming frail, are invited for a face-to-face assessment focusing on the domains in depth. We deployed the PERSSILAA screening procedure in primary care in the Netherlands.ResultsIn total, baseline data were available for 3777 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 69.9 (SD3.8)) who completed first step screening. Based on predefined cut-off scores, 16.8% of the sample were classified as frail (n=634), 20.6% as pre-frail (n=777), and 62.3% as robust (n=2353). Frail subjects were referred back to their GP without going through the second step. Of the pre-frail older adults, 69.7% had evidence of functional decline on the physical domain, 67% were overweight or obese and 31.0% had evidence of cognitive decline.Conclusion p id=S Pre-frailty is common among community-dwelling older adults. The PERSSILAA screening approach is a multi-factor, two-step screening process, potentially useful for primary prevention to identify those at risk of frailty and who will benefit most from preventive strategies.

AB BackgroundChildren and adolescents with HIV/AIDS are more likely to have emotional and behavioral problems than the general population. This can result in a continuing negative influence on the quality of life, school performance, immunity and co-morbidity of children and adolescents with HIV/AIDS.ObjectiveTo assess the prevalence and associated factors of Emotional and Behavioral Problems among children and adolescents on Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy in the public hospitals of West Gojjam Zone, Amhara regional state of Ethiopia.MethodsAn institutional based cross sectional study was conducted by screening 411 children and adolescents for emotional and behavioral problems using Pediatric Symptomatology Check List (PSCL). Systematic random sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 23. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis were fitted to identify factors associated with Emotional and Behavioral Problems. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed to determine the level of significance.ResultOut of the total 411 participants, 43.6% were screened positive for Emotional and Behavioral Problems. Lower age (AOR=5.33, 95%CI: 2.56-11.04), having non-kin care giver (AOR=4.64, 95%CI: 1.20-17.90), parental loss (AOR=2.15, 95%CI: 1.03-4.49), non self -disclosure of HIV sero status (AOR=1.99, 95% CI: 1.16-3.41) and having distressed care giver (AOR=1.64, 95%CI: 1.04-2.57) had statistically significant association with EBPs.ConclusionThe prevalence of Emotional and Behavioral Problems is high among children and adolescents on HAART. Lower age, care giver's mental distress, non-self disclosure status, having non-kin care giver and parental loss were variables significantly associated with EBPs. This demonstrates a need for the integration of Mental Health and Psycho Social Support (MHPSS) service with HIV/AIDS care.

AB BackgroundTraditional medicine has always been Pakistan's cultural heritage, providing health care to a large part of its population. Thus, we aimed to assess and compare the knowledge, attitude, and perception about complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) between pharmacy and non-pharmacy students, the results of which may be helpful in devising national health-education policy.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted by enrolling 937 students, pharmacy (437) and non-pharmacy (500), of Punjab University, Lahore. A self-administered questionnaire was used for data collection. Data were analyzed using SPSS. (IBM v22).ResultsData suggested that majority of students knew about the use of traditional herbs and considered massage (P: 84.4%, NP: 82%, p=0.099), homeopathy, herbs (P: 86.5%, NP: 81%, p=0.064], yoga [P: 357 (81.7%), NP: 84%), p=0.42] and spiritual healing (P: 85.6%, NP: 86.2%, p=0.55) as effective and least harmful CAM modalities. The pharmacy students had better knowledge about CAM modalities compared to non-pharmacy students. Despite utilizing non-reliable sources of CAM information and their belief that CAM is practiced by quacks, the majority of students had positive attitudes and perceptions about CAM usage. Students also believed that CAM had a positive impact on health outcomes [P: 3.191.04, NP: 3.02 +/- 1.09, p=0.008] and acceded to include CAM in the pharmacy curriculum. However, non-pharmacy students scored higher in their beliefs that CAM usage should be discouraged due to the non-scientific basis of CAM (P: 3.04 +/- 0.97, NP: 3.17 +/- 1.02, p=0.028) and a possible threat to public health (P: 3.81 +/- 1.74, NP: 4.06 +/- 1.56, p=0.02). On the other hand, pharmacy students believed that patients might get benefits from CAM modalities (P: 4.31 +/- 1.48, NP: 4.12 +/- 1.45, p=0.02). Majority of students perceived that spiritual healing is the most useful and safer CAM modality, while acupuncture (P: 25.4%, NP: 21.8%, p=0.0005), hypnosis (P: 26.8%, NP: 19.6%, p=0.001) and chiropractic (P: 18.8%, NP: 11.6%, p=0.0005) were among the harmful ones.Conclusion p id=Par4 In conclusion, despite poor knowledge about CAM, students demonstrated positive attitudes and beliefs regarding CAM. They exhibited better awareness about yoga, spiritual healing/prayer, herbs, and massage. Students also showed willingness to advance their knowledge about CAM and favored its inclusion in the curriculum.

AB BackgroundDecreased muscle strength and/or depression with aging are emerging as important public health concerns in both developed and developing countries. This study investigated the effects of low handgrip strength (HGS) and depression on the risk of all-cause mortality in Korean older adults.MethodsData from 13,901 Korean adults (57% women) who participated in the 2008 baseline survey and completed the 2011 follow-up assessments were used.ResultsIn total, the current findings showed that individuals with depression only and individuals with low HGS plus depression had significantly higher risks of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR)=1.366, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.033-1.807, p=0.029 and HR=1.961, 95% CI=1.409-2.736, p<0.001, respectively) even after adjustments for all the measured covariates, compared with individuals with high HGS plus no depression (HR=1). Gender-stratified analysis showed that men with depression only and men with depression plus low HGS had significantly higher risks of all-cause mortality (HR=1.376, 95% CI =1.029-1.841, p=0.031 and HR=1.861, 95% CI=1.306-2.651, p=0.001, respectively) even after adjustments for all the measured covariates, compared with individuals with no depression plus high HGS (HR=1). In women, however, the joint effect of depression and low HGS only remained significant at borderline (HR=2.603, 95% CI=0.981-6.908, p=0.055) when adjusted for all the confounders.ConclusionThe current finding suggested that depression and low HGS were significantly and synergistically associated with the increased risk of premature death from all causes in the Korean geriatric population.

AB BackgroundReliable data from health surveys are essential to describe the status and trends in health indicators by means of information not available from official registers. In Denmark, nationally representative health surveys (the Danish Health and Morbidity Surveys) have been carried out among adults during the past three decades by the Danish National Institute of Public Health, University of Southern Denmark. The aim of the present study is to describe the study design of the three most recent surveys in 2010, 2013, and 2017, including the survey mode and response rates.MethodsIn 2010, 2013, and 2017, the samples (n=25,000 each) were based on random sampling of individuals aged 16years or older with a permanent residence in Denmark. A subsample of previously invited respondents was also re-invited in subsequent survey waves. Data were collected through self-administered questionnaires, yet with a concurrent mixed-mode approach, allowing for the invited individuals to complete either a web questionnaire or an identical paper questionnaire. In 2010 and 2013, survey invitations were sent by regular postal mail, whereas a secure electronical mail service, Digital Post, was used to invite the majority (90.1%) of the sample in 2017.ResultsThe overall response rate decreased from 60.7% in 2010 to 57.1% in 2013 and 56.1% in 2017. Between 2010 and 2017 the response mode distribution for the web questionnaire increased markedly from 31.7 to 73.8%. The largest increase in the proportion which completed the web questionnaire was found in the oldest age group.ConclusionsData from the Danish Health and Morbidity Surveys reveal an increasing proportion of the respondents to complete web questionnaires instead of paper questionnaires. Even though the response rate remained relatively stable in 2017, declining response rates is a major concern in health surveys. As the generalizability to the Danish population may be compromised by a low response rate, efforts to increase the response rate or keep it stable are crucial in future surveys. Thus, efforts should be made to ensure convenience and feasibility in relation to access to and the completion of survey (web) questionnaires.

AB Acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI) is a global public health priority that often disproportionately effects Indigenous populations. While previous research examines the association between meteorological conditions and AGI, little is known about how socio-cultural factors may modify this relationship. This present study seeks to address this research gap by comparing AGI prevalence and determinants between an Indigenous and non-Indigenous population in Uganda. We estimate the 14-day self-reported prevalence of AGI among adults in an Indigenous Batwa population and their non-Indigenous neighbours using cross-sectional panel data collected over four periods spanning typically rainy and dry seasons (January 2013 to April 2014). The independent associations between Indigenous status, precipitation, and AGI are examined with multivariable multi-level logistic regression models, controlling for relative wealth status and clustering at the community level. Estimated prevalence of AGI among the Indigenous Batwa was greater than among the non-Indigenous Bakiga. Our models indicate that both Indigenous identity and decreased levels of precipitation in the weeks preceding the survey period were significantly associated with increased AGI, after adjusting for confounders. Multivariable models stratified by Indigenous identity suggest that Indigenous identity may not modify the association between precipitation and AGI in this context. Our results suggest that short-term changes in precipitation affect both Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations similarly, though from different baseline AGI prevalences, maintaining rather than exacerbating this socially patterned health disparity. In the context of climate change, these results may challenge the assumption that changing weather patterns will necessarily exacerbate existing socially patterned health disparities.

AB To diagnose >= 90% HIV-infected residents (diagnostic coverage), the Bukoba Combination Prevention Evaluation (BCPE) implemented provider-initiated (PITC), home-(HBHTC), and venue-based (VBHTC) HIV testing and counseling (HTC) intervention in Bukoba Municipal Council, a mixed urban and rural lake zone community of 150,000 residents in Tanzania. This paper describes the methods, outcomes, and incremental costs of these HTC interventions. PITC was implemented in outpatient department clinics in all eight public and three faith-based health facilities. In clinics, lay counselors routinely screened and referred eligible patients for HIV testing conducted by HTC-dedicated healthcare workers. In all 14 wards, community teams offered HTC to eligible persons encountered at 31,293 home visits and at 79 male-and youth-frequented venues. HTC was recommended for persons who were not in HIV care or had not tested in the prior 90 days. BCPE conducted 133,695 HIV tests during the 2.5 year intervention (PITC: 88,813, 66%; HBHTC: 27,407, 21%; VBHTC: 17,475, 13%). Compared with other strategies, PITC conducted proportionally more tests among females (65%), and VBHTC conducted proportionally more tests among males (69%) and young-adults aged 15-24 years (42%). Of 5,550 (4.2% of all tests) HIV-positive tests, 4,143 (75%) clients were newly HIV diagnosed, including 1,583 males and 881 young adults aged 15-24 years. Of HIV tests conducted 3.7%, 1.8%, and 2.1% of PITC, HBHTC, and VBHTC clients, respectively, were newly HIV diagnosed; PITC accounted for 79% of all new diagnoses. Cost per test (per new diagnosis) was $4.55 ($123.66), $6.45 ($354.44), and $7.98 ($372.67) for PITC, HBHTC, and VBHTC, respectively. In a task-shifting analysis in which lay counselors replaced healthcare workers, estimated costs per test (per new diagnosis) would have been $3.06 ($83.15), $4.81 ($264.04), and $5.45 ($254.52), for PITC, HBHTC, and VBHTC, respectively. BCPE models reached different target groups, including men and young adults, two groups with consistently low coverage. Implementation of multiple models is likely necessary to achieve. 90% diagnostic coverage.

ID CROSS-PRIMING AMPLIFICATION; RAPID DETECTION; LAMP
AB Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) constitutes a major cause of diarrhea in young children and animals, particularly in poor regions of the world, as well the traveler's diarrhea in adult individuals. Type II heat-labile enterotoxin (LT-II) from ETEC can cause profuse watery diarrhea, posing a potential threat to public health and animal husbandry. In the present study, isothermal multiple-self-matching-initiated amplification (IMSA) was established to rapidly detect LT-II producing ETEC. The specificity and sensitivity were assessed, and clinical samples were tested. The established IMSA method had good specificity for the detection of LT-II gene with a limit of detection of 25 CFU/mL, i.e. 2 times higher than that of real-time PCR and other two isothermal amplifications (loop-mediated isothermal amplification, LAMP and cross-primer isothermal amplification, CPA). Meanwhile, in 103 clinical Escherichia coli strains isolated from diarrhea samples, 9 strains with LT-II+ gene were detected (8.73%), corroborating real-time PCR, LAMP and CPA data. Therefore, the IMSA technology applied for the detection of LT-II producing ETEC has a good application prospect for screening clinical samples in primary medical units or common laboratories.

   STROKE; MORTALITY
AB Background
   Currently, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is widely acknowledged to be the first leading cause of fatality in the world with 31% of all deaths worldwide and is predicted to remain as such in 2030. Furthermore, CVD is also a major cause of morbidity in adults worldwide. Among these diseases, the coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cause, accounting for over 40% of CVD deaths. Despite a decline in mortality rates, the consequences of more effective preventive and management programs, the burden of CAD remains significant. Indeed, the rise in the prevalence of modifiable risk factors due to changes in lifestyle and health behaviors has further increased the burden of this epidemic. Our objective was to evaluate the hospital burden of CAD via MI trends and Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) in the French Prospective Payment System (PPS).
   Methods
   MI/PCI were identified in the national PPS database from 2009 to 2014 for patients aged 20 to 99, living in metropolitan France. We examined hospitalisation, readmission and mortality trends using standardised rates.
   Results
   Over the six-year period, we identified 678,021 patients, representing 900,121 stays of which, 215,224 had a MI and a PCI. Admission trends increased by nearly 25%. Acute MI cases increased every year, with an alarming increase in women, and more specifically in young women. Men were 3 times more hospitalised than women, who were older. A North-South divide was noted. Twenty seven percent of patients experienced readmission within 1 month. Trajectories of care were significantly different by sex and age. Overall in-hospital death was 3.3%, decreasing by 15% during the period. The highest adjusted mortality rates were observed for inpatients aged <40 or >80.
   Conclusion
   We outlined the public health burden of this condition and the importance of improving the trajectories of care as an aid for better care.

AB BackgroundOn 6th April 2018, the UK Government introduced the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) as a mechanism designed to address increasing prevalence of obesity and associated ill health by reducing sugar consumption. Given that the successful introduction of upstream food and nutrition policies is a highly political enterprise involving multiple interested parties, understanding the complex network of stakeholders seeking to influence such policy decisions is imperative.MethodsMedia content analysis was used to build a dataset of relevant newspaper articles, which were analysed to identify stakeholder agreement or disagreement with defined concept statements. We used discourse network analysis to produce visual representations of the network of stakeholders and coalitions evident in the debate as it was presented in UK newspapers, in the lead up to and following the announcement of the Soft Drinks Industry Levy in the UK, from May 2015 to November 2016.ResultsCoding identified 3883 statements made by 214 individuals from 176 organisations, relating to 47 concepts. Network visualisations revealed a complex network of stakeholders with clear sceptical and supportive coalitions. Industry stakeholders appeared less united in the network than anticipated, particularly before the SDIL announcement. Some key industry actors appeared in the supportive coalition, possibly due to the use of corporate social responsibility rhetoric. Jamie Oliver appeared as a dominant stakeholder, firmly embedded with public health advocates.ConclusionThis study highlights the complexity of the network of stakeholders involved in the public debate on food policies such as sugar tax and the SDIL. Polarisation of stakeholders arose from differences in ideology, focus on a specific policy and statements about the weight of evidence. Vocal celebrity policy entrepreneurs may be instrumental in gaining public and policy makers' support for future upstream regulation to promote population health, to facilitate alignment around a clear ideology.

AB BackgroundThere is robust evidence that regular physical activity (PA) has positive health effects. However, the best PA methods and the most important correlates for promoting PA remain unclear. Physical activity on prescription (PAP) aims to increase the patient's motivation for and level of PA. This study investigated possible predictive baseline correlates associated with changes in the PA level over a 6-month period of PAP treatment in order to identify the primary care patients most likely to benefit from a PAP intervention.MethodsThe study included 444 patients with metabolic risk factors who were aged 27 to 85years and physically inactive. The patients received PAP treatment that included individual counseling plus an individually-tailored PA recommendation with a written prescription and individualised structured follow-up for 6months. Eight baseline correlates of PA were analysed against the PA level at the 6-month follow-up in a predictor analysis.ResultsFive baseline correlates predicted the PA level at the 6-month follow-up: self-efficacy expectations for changing PA; the patient's preparedness and confidence regarding readiness to change PA; a BMI<30; and a positive valued physical health. The proportion of patients increasing the PA level and achieving a PA level that was in accordance with public health recommendations was higher with a positive valued baseline correlate. The odds of achieving the recommended PA level increased substantially when 2 to 4 predictive correlates were present. PA levels increased to a greater extent among patients with low PA at baseline than patients with high PA at baseline, especially in combination with 2 to 4 positively-valued correlates (87-95% vs. 62-75%).ConclusionsThis study identified potential predictive correlates of an increased PA level after a 6-month PAP intervention. This contributes to our understanding of PAP and could help individualise PAP support. The proportion of patients with the lowest PA level at baseline increased their PA level in a higher extent (84%) and thus may benefit the most from PAP. These results have clinical implications for behavioural change in those patients having the greatest health gains by increasing their PA level.

AB BackgroundGlobally in 2015 about 214 million malaria cases and 438,000 deaths were reported with 75% were from Sub-Saharan Africa. Malaria transmission in Ethiopia is unstable, and outbreaks are considered public health emergencies. Understanding the trigger for outbreaks in low-transmission areas can help facilitate malaria elimination. On July 8th malaria outbreak was reported from Laelay Adyabo district. The objective was to investigate the magnitude and associated factors with malaria outbreak.MethodsWe defined a case as confirmed malaria using microscopy or a rapid diagnostic test for Plasmodium parasites in a resident of Laelay-Adyabo District from July 9-28, 2017. We identified cases by reviewing health facility records and conducted a case-control study using randomly-selected cases from a line list, and two neighborhood controls per case. A pretested semi-structured questionnaire adapted from WHO malaria guidelines was used to collect data from case-patients and controls. We calculated crude (COR) and adjusted (AOR) odds ratios to identify factors associated with malaria.ResultA total of 145 confirmed malaria cases (57.9% males) were identified with village attack rate (AR) of 12.1/1000. The AR was higher among males than females (14.1 verses 10.1/1000), children aged 5-14years (12.9/1000), and in Zelazle Kebelle (13.6/1000 population). Wearing protective clothing (AOR=0.27, 95% CI 0.11-0.66), having good knowledge of malaria transmission (AOR=0.25, 95% CI 0.08-0.75), having waste collection material at home (AOR=0.25 95% CI 0.11-0.61), availability of mosquito breeding sites around home (AOR=9.08, 95% CI 3.6-22.93), and staying outdoor overnight (AOR=3.7, 95% CI 1.44-9.56) were independently associated with malaria.ConclusionThe overall attack rate for malaria during this outbreak was high affecting >1% of the population. Wearing protective clothing at night, knowing about malaria transmission, having mosquito breeding sites around the home, staying outdoors overnight, and having waste collection material in their house were predictors of the infection. Laelay Adyabo district health office should provide health education on malaria transmission and prevention measures and how to clear mosquito breeding sites.

AB BackgroundQuick scaling-up of innovative and promising interventions in health systems of low and middle-income countries to rapidly achieve population level benefits is a key challenge. While there is consensus on the need for rigorous scientific evidence on effectiveness of interventions before considering scale-up, there can be significant time lag for the want of gold-standard evidence. The Safe Childbirth Checklist (SCC) programme in India, demonstrated how an innovation was robustly evaluated and scaled up nationally, within a short span of time. In this narrative review, we describe the strategies discussed in various published scale-up frameworks and map them against the strategies adopted by the SCC programme to identify accelerators which facilitated its rapid scale up.MethodsThe narrative review - done from May to June 2017 - involved keyword searches of electronic databases of PubMed, Ovid Medline and Google Scholar. It included the key words pilot', health innovations', scale-up', replication', expansion', increased coverage', conceptual models for scale-up', frame-works for scale-up', evidence for scale-up' in the title of publications,. This search was limited to publications in English after the year 1995. We used snowball sampling approach (by referring to bibliographies of shortlisted publications) to identify additional publications related to scale-up. We then screened the identified publications independently and relevant publications that discussed attributes for a conceptual model for scale-up of public health interventions in low and middle-income countries were shortlisted. We then mapped the strategies we used in SCC program scale up against those described in the shortlisted frameworks to identify seven accelerators which facilitated rapid scale up.ResultsThe identified accelerators were: testing the intervention in real world, resource constrained settings; using an appropriate and time sensitive research design; testing the intervention at substantial scale and in diverse settings; using an adaptive and iterative prototyping approach for implementation; sharing data and evidence with key stakeholders on an ongoing basis; targeting bridge resources through strategic engagement of stakeholders and timely integration of scale-up plans with annual planning and budgeting cycles and systems.ConclusionThese accelerators will complement current frameworks and provide guidance to future scale-up initiatives in India and elsewhere.

AB BackgroundClimate change is expected to increase the chance of extreme rainfall events in the Northern Hemisphere and herewith, there is an increased chance of urban pluvial flooding. Urban pluvial flooding often consists of street flooding and/or flooding of combined sewerage systems, leading to contamination of the floodwater with several gastrointestinal and/or respiratory pathogens. An increase in flooding events therefore pose a health risk to those exposed to urban floodwater. We studied the association between exposure to pluvial floodwater and acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and acute respiratory infection (ARI).MethodsWe performed a retrospective, cross-sectional survey during the summer of 2015 in 60 locations in the Netherlands with reported flooding. Two weeks after the flooding, questionnaires were sent to households in these locations, collecting data on self-reported AGE and ARI and information on floodwater exposure in the previous 2 weeks. Multivariable generalized estimating equations (GEE) regression models, accounting for the clustered data structure, were used to identify risk factors for AGE and ARI.ResultsIn total, 699 households with 1,656 participants (response rate 21%) returned the questionnaire. Contact with floodwater was significantly associated with AGE (aOR 4.2, 95%CI 2.1-8.4) and ARI (aOR 3.3, 95%CI 2.0-5.4). Risk factors for AGE were skin contact with floodwater (aOR 4.0, 95%CI 1.8-9.0), performing post-flooding cleaning operations (aOR 8.6, 95%CI 3.5-20.9) and cycling through floodwater (aOR 2.3, 95%CI 1.0-5.0). Skin contact with floodwater (aOR 3.6, 95%CI 1.9-6.9) and performing post-flooding cleaning operations (aOR 5.5, 95%CI 3.0-10.3) were identified as risk factors for ARI.ConclusionsResults suggest an association between direct exposure to pluvial floodwater and AGE and ARI. As it is predicted that the frequency of pluvial flooding events will increase in the future, there is a need for flood-proof solutions in urban development and increased awareness among stakeholders and the public about the potential health risks. Future prospective studies are recommended to confirm our results.

AB BackgroundSeveral inactivated enterovirus-A71 (EV-A71) vaccines are currently licensed in China; however, the development of additional EV-A71 vaccines is ongoing, necessitating extensive analysis of the molecular epidemiology of the virus worldwide. Until 2012, laboratory confirmation of EV-A71 for hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) and other associated diseases had not occurred in the Philippines. Because EV-A71 has been linked with cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), AFP surveillance is one strategy for documenting its possible circulation in the country. To expand current knowledge on EV-A71, molecular epidemiologic analysis and genetic characterization of EV-A71 isolates were performed in this study.MethodsA retrospective study was performed to identify and characterize nonpolio enteroviruses (NPEVs) associated with AFP in the Philippines, and nine samples were found to be EV-A71-positive. Following characterization of these EV-A71 isolates, the complete viral protein 1 (VP1) gene was targeted for phylogenetic analysis.ResultsNine EV-A71 isolates detected in 2000 (n=2), 2002 (n=4), 2005 (n=2), and 2010 (n=1) were characterized using molecular methods. Genomic regions spanning the complete VP1 region were amplified and sequenced using specific primers. Phylogenetic analysis of the full-length VP1 region identified all nine EV-A71 Philippine isolates as belonging to the genogroup C lineage, specifically the C2 cluster. The result indicated a genetic linkage with several strains isolated in Japan and Taiwan, suggesting that strains in the C2 cluster identified in the Asia-Pacific region were circulating in the Philippines.ConclusionThe study presents the genetic analysis of EV-A71 in the Philippines. Despite some limitations, the study provides additional genetic data on the circulating EV-A71 strains in the Asia-Pacific region, in which information on EV-A71 molecular epidemiology is incomplete. Considering that EV-A71 has a significant public health impact in the region, knowledge of its circulation in each country is important, especially for formulating vaccines covering a wide variety of strains.

ID PRISONS
AB BackgroundIn the UK, hepatitis B virus (HBV) incidence is associated with migrants from particular high-burden countries and population groups deemed hard-to-reach' by standard healthcare services: the homeless, people who inject drugs and ex-prisoners. Currently, there is a national targeted HBV vaccine policy for such at-risk groups, but there is limited recent evidence about 1) the levels of vaccine uptake, 2) the factors associated with incomplete vaccination, and 3) reasons for incomplete vaccination.MethodsA questionnaire capturing social and medical history, demographic factors and information about HBV vaccination status was completed by individuals deemed hard-to-reach due to socio-structural factors that criminalise, isolate and stigmatise who consented to participate in a randomised controlled trial of a peer intervention to promote engagement with hepatitis C services. The questionnaire also captured the reasons for incomplete vaccination. Descriptive, univariable and multivariable regression analyses were undertaken.ResultsThree hundred fourty six participants completed the questionnaire. 1) 52.3% (n=181) reported full HBV vaccination. 2) Within a multivariable model adjusting for sociodemographic variables, the presence of one or two or more socio-structural factors that are included in the national targeted vaccination policy was associated with protection against incomplete HBV vaccination (51.7% vaccine coverage in those with one factor, odds ratio 0.43 [95% confidence interval 0.20-0.92]); 70.1% coverage with two or more factors, 0.19 [0.09-0.39]; overall p-value <0.001). Being female was also associated with lower vaccine uptake (2.37 [1.24-4.57], 0.01). Examining the socio-structural factors individually, intravenous drug use was associated with protection against incomplete HBV vaccination. 3) The most common reasons declared for incomplete vaccination were never being offered the vaccine or not returning for further doses.ConclusionWithin this study of HBV vaccination uptake among hard-to-reach population groups in London, UK, we document 52.3% coverage of the full vaccine course. Critically, although participants recommended for immunisation within national guidelines had an increased likelihood of receiving a complete vaccine course, we note surprisingly low coverage in the presence of the risk factors that are national indicators for vaccination. Public health bodies should make additional efforts to improve coverage in the hard-to-reach through improved vaccine delivery systems.Trial registrationISRCTN24707359, Registered 19th October 2012.

AB BackgroundUrinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common bacterial infections. High recurrence rates and the increasing antibiotic resistance among uropathogens constitute a large social and economic problem in current public health. We assumed that combination of treatment that includes the administration ceragenins (CSAs), will reinforce the effect of antimicrobial LL-37 peptide continuously produced by urinary tract epithelial cells. Such treatment might be an innovative approach to enhance innate antibacterial activity against multidrug-resistant E. coli.MethodsAntibacterial activity measured using killing assays. Biofilm formation was assessed using crystal violet staining. Viability of bacteria and bladder epithelial cells subjected to incubation with tested agents was determined using MTT assays. We investigated the effects of chosen molecules, both alone and in combinations against four clinical strains of E. coli, obtained from patients diagnosed with recurrent UTI.ResultsWe observed that the LL-37 peptide, whose concentration increases at sites of urinary infection, exerts increased bactericidal effect against E. coli when combined with ceragenins CSA-13 and CSA-131.ConclusionWe suggest that the employment of combination of natural peptide LL-37 with synthetic analogs might be a potential solution to treat urinary tract infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria.

AB BackgroundPromoting research capacity within public health can encourage and engage employees to undertake research, utilising their understanding of the complex needs that exist within the public health system to provide more relevant research outcomes. Despite this, there are a number of reasons cited by health care professionals as to why research is not undertaken, and a lack of support for research participation results in missed opportunities for experienced clinical and public health staff to gain research experience, expand the evidence base, and promote and support research. The aim of this study is to identify if education in research, delivered through a series of lectures at a large tertiary referral hospital, results in an increase in the experience and intent to conduct research.MethodsA series of six lectures to aid in the understanding and development of research were delivered to health employees, health care professionals, students and their associates within a large public Australian hospital. Following these lectures, a validated instrument was developed and asked respondents to assess their research activity, research training history, and experience in conducting research using a retrospective pre/post- test design.ResultsOver half (57.1%) of respondents (n=49) reported no previous researcher education training prior to the lectures. Following the lectures, reported researcher experience increased significantly in the areas of writing a research protocol, using qualitative research methods, publishing research, writing and presenting a research report, analysing and interpreting results, using quantitative research methods, generating research ideas, and applying for research funding. At 6months following the lecture series intent to be involved in further research was seen in the areas of submitting an ethics application, analysing qualitative and quantitative research data, and research funding applications.ConclusionsSix one hour face to face research lectures can improve self-reported levels of intention to become involved in research as well as research experience amongst hospital health care professionals at 6 months. This traditional modality of education should still be considered as relevant strategy in building research capacity as measured innovatively using a retrospective pre/post test methodology.

AB BackgroundPregnant girls/young women and new mothers living in situations of social and economic disadvantage are at increased risk for poor health. Rural living may compound marginalization and create additional challenges for young mothers. Public health nurses (PHNs) delivering the Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) to mothers living in rural communities may help to improve maternal and child health outcomes. The purpose of this analysis, grounded in data collected as part of a broader process evaluation, was to explore and understand the influence of rural geography on the delivery of NFP in British Columbia, Canada.MethodsFor the analysis of this qualitative data, principles of inductive reasoning based on the methodology of interpretive description were applied. A total of 10 PHNs and 11 supervisors providing the NFP program in rural communities were interviewed.ResultsThe results of this analysis reflect the factors and challenges of providing the NFP program in rural communities. PHNs noted the importance of NFP in the lives of their rural clients, especially in the face of extreme financial and social disparity. Remaining flexible in their approach to rural nursing and protecting time to complete NFP work supported nurses practicing in rural environments. Rural PHNs were often the sole NFP nurse in their office and struggled to remain connected to their supervisors and other NFP colleagues. Challenges were compounded by the realities of rural geography, such as poor weather, reduced accessibility, and long travel distances; however, these were considered normal occurrences of rural practice by nurses.ConclusionsPHNs and NFP supervisors are well-positioned to identify the modifications that are required to support the delivery of NFP in rural geography. NFP nurses need to articulate what classifies as rural in order to effectively determine how to best provide services to these populations. Environmental conditions must be considered when offering NFP in rural communities, particularly if they impact the time required to deliver the program and additional services offered to young mothers. Regular NFP meetings and education opportunities address common problems associated with rural nursing but could be enhanced by better use of technology.

AB Arrhythmic sudden cardiac death (SCD) represents a major worldwide public health problem accounting for 15-20% of deaths. Risk stratification to identify patients at risk of SCD is crucial in order to implement preventive measures in the general population. Several biomarkers have been tested exploring different pathophysiological mechanisms of cardiac conditions. Conflicting results have been described limiting so far their use in clinical practice. The use of new biomarkers such as microRNAs and sex hormones and the emerging role of genetic on risk prediction of SCD is a current research topic showing promising results.This review outlines the role of plasma biomarkers to predict ventricular arrhythmias and SCD in non coronary artery disease with a special focus on their relationship with the genetic biomarkers.

AB Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) belongs to the family of Phenuiviridae within the order of Bunyavirales. The virus may cause fatal disease both in livestock and humans, and therefore, is of great economical and public health relevance. In analogy to the influenza virus polymerase complex, the bunyavirus L protein is assumed to bind to and cleave off cap structures of cellular mRNAs to prime viral transcription. However, even though the presence of an endonuclease in the N-terminal domain of the L protein has been demonstrated for several bunyaviruses, there is no evidence for a cap-binding site within the L protein. We solved the structure of a C-terminal 117 amino acid-long domain of the RVFV L protein by X-ray crystallography. The overall fold of the domain shows high similarity to influenza virus PB2 cap-binding domain and the putative non-functional cap-binding domain of reptarena-viruses. Upon co-crystallization with m 7 GTP, we detected the cap-analogue bound between two aromatic side chains as it has been described for other cap-binding proteins. We observed weak but specific interaction with m 7 GTP rather than GTP in vitro using isothermal titration calorimetry. The importance of m 7 GTP-binding residues for viral transcription was validated using a RVFV minigenome system. In summary, we provide structural and functional evidence for a cap-binding site located within the L protein of a virus from the Bunyavirales order.

AB Understanding the mechanisms that promote the assembly and maintenance of host-beneficial microbiomes is an open problem. Empirical evidence supports the idea that animal and plant hosts can combine private resources' with the ecological phenomenon known as community bistability' to favour some microbial strains over others. We briefly review evidence showing that hosts can: (i) protect the growth of beneficial strains in an isolated habitat, (ii) use antibiotics to suppress non-beneficial, competitor strains, and (iii) provide resources that only beneficial strains are able to translate into an increased rate of growth, reproduction, or antibiotic production. We then demonstrate in a spatially explicit, individual-based model that these three mechanisms act similarly by selectively promoting the initial proliferation of preferred strains, that is, by acting as a private resource. The faster early growth of preferred strains, combined with the phenomenon of community bistability,' allows those strains to continue to dominate the microbiome even after the private resource is withdrawn or made public. This is because after a beneficial colony reaches a sufficiently large size, it can resist invasion by parasites without further private support from the host. We further explicitly model localized microbial interactions and diffusion dynamics, and we show that an intermediate level of antibiotic diffusion is the most efficient mechanism in promoting preferred strains and that there is a wide range of parameters under which hosts can promote the assembly of a self-sustaining defensive microbiome. This in turn supports the idea that hosts readily evolve to promote host-beneficial defensive microbiomes.
   Author summary Host-associated microbiomes are complex communities, harbouring a great diversity of beneficial, neutral, or harmful species. Microbiome composition can have a significant effect on the health status and fitness of the host, and thus host species are selected to evolve mechanisms that favour the assembly of certain kinds of microbiomes over others. As we demonstrate, both by reviewing the literature and by using a detailed, spatially explicit, mathematical model, a host species can employ several cost-effective mechanisms to promote the establishment of beneficial bacteria, for example antibiotic producers, and to prevent the invasion of harmful microbes. These mechanisms include the host providing private resources in the form of a food source or inhabitable space that the preferred antibiotic-producing species are able to use to their advantage against species that are harmful to the host. After an antibiotic-producing species establishes itself with the help of the host, its colony is now self-sustaining, even if host resources now become publicly available, and can provide a reliable safeguard against parasites.

AB Antibiotic-resistance of hospital-acquired infections is a major public health issue. The worldwide emergence and diffusion of extended-spectrum -lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, including Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP), is of particular concern. Preventing their nosocomial spread requires understanding their transmission. Using Close Proximity Interactions (CPIs), measured by wearable sensors, and weekly ESBL-EC-and ESBL-KP-carriage data, we traced their possible transmission paths among 329 patients in a 200-bed long-term care facility over 4 months. Based on phenotypically defined resistance profiles to 12 antibiotics only, new bacterial acquisitions were tracked. Extending a previously proposed statistical method, the CPI network's ability to support observed incident-colonization episodes of ESBL-EC and ESBL-KP was tested. Finally, mathematical modeling based on our findings assessed the effect of several infection-control measures. A potential infector was identified in the CPI network for 80% (16/20) of ESBL-KP acquisition episodes. The lengths of CPI paths between ESBL-KP incident cases and their potential infectors were shorter than predicted by chance (P = 0.02), indicating that CPI-network relationships were consistent with dissemination. Potential ESBL-EC infectors were identified for 54% (19/35) of the acquisitions, with longer-than-expected lengths of CPI paths. These contrasting results yielded differing impacts of infection control scenarios, with contact reduction interventions proving less effective for ESBL-EC than for ESBL-KP. These results highlight the widely variable transmission patterns among ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae species. CPI networks supported ESBL-KP, but not ESBL-EC spread. These outcomes could help design more specific surveillance and control strategies to prevent in-hospital Enterobacteriaceae dissemination.
   Author summary Tracing extended-spectrum -lactamase (ESBL) dissemination in hospitals is an important step in the fight against the spread of multi-drug resistant bacteria. Indeed, understanding ESBL spreading dynamics will help identify efficient control interventions. In the i-Bird study, patients and hospital staff from a French long-term care facility carried a wearable sensor to capture their interactions at less than 1.5 meters, every 30 seconds over a 4-month period. Every week, patients were also swabbed to detect carriage of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Based on the analysis of these longitudinal data, this study shows that ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP) mostly spreads during close-proximity interactions between individuals, while this is not the case for ESBL-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC), suggesting that ESBL-KP but not ESBL-EC may be controlled by contact reduction interventions.

AB Author summary Improvements in technology often drive scientific discovery. Therefore, research requires sustained investment in the latest equipment and training for the researchers who are going to use it. Prioritising and administering infrastructure investment is challenging because future needs are difficult to predict. In the past, highly computationally demanding research was associated primarily with particle physics and astronomy experiments. However, as biology becomes more quantitative and bioscientists generate more and more data, their computational requirements may ultimately exceed those of physical scientists. Computation has always been central to bioinformatics, but now imaging experiments have rapidly growing data processing and storage requirements. There is also an urgent need for new modelling and simulation tools to provide insight and understanding of these biophysical experiments. Bioscience communities must work together to provide the software and skills training needed in their areas. Research-active institutions need to recognise that computation is now vital in many more areas of discovery and create an environment where it can be embraced. The public must also become aware of both the power and limitations of computing, particularly with respect to their health and personal data.
