TI Setting targets for HIV/AIDS-What lessons can be learned from other
   disease control programmes?

ID TUBERCULOSIS-CONTROL; MALARIA CONTROL; TB-STRATEGY; LEPROSY; ELIMINATION
AB Our analysis of experience from programmes targeting malaria, leprosy and TB shows the importance of drawing broadly on research and implementation expertise, and civil society more broadly, when setting targets for HIV control. The engagement of stake-holders from the highest burden settings, including affected populations, is crucial, to ensure that disease control efforts uphold human rights and tackle HIV-related stigma and discrimination.
   An appropriate balance is needed between ambitious, galvanising global targets that drive funding and political/public engagement, and targets that reflect the complexities and local epidemiological variations in disease profile. Ethical issues and unintended consequences need to be considered when setting targets-particularly around local effects and opportunity costs of having foregone other areas of disease control and public health. Intermediate and adaptable targets are needed that allow for course corrections to programmes.
   Overly burdensome reporting requirements for individual local programmes and countries should be avoided, as well as potential for overlapping and sometimes conflicting targets both within and across vertical disease programmes. Process targets should be distinguished from outcome targets, which should be measurable and based on high-quality data.
   Retention of expert healthcare worker skills and specialist services is vital, while moving towards integrated health systems if effective disease control programmes are to be maintained. Target development should seek areas of programme delivery where an opportunity to codevelop targets and integrate services exists. Global efforts to move to universal health coverage (UHC), for example, could be factored in when developing targets.
   Sustaining investment and continuing political interest in the end phase of any elimination or eradication strategy, once incidence and prevalence are low, are critical to achieve success. Equity-and access-based service delivery targets become increasingly important as the elimination strategy nears its end and should be factored into planning.
   Achieving disease elimination and/or eradication is only possible with sufficient investment in research to develop new prevention tools such as vaccines, point-of-care diagnostics, and treatments to counteract the effects of increasing drug resistance and the challenging latency period of diseases; public health infrastructure upgrades that address wider determinants of health; and health and surveillance systems that allow for equitable delivery and access to services.

AB Resistance to the anthelmintic macrocyclic lactone ivermectin (IVM) has a great impact on the control of parasitic nematodes. The mechanisms by which nematodes adapt to IVM remain to be deciphered. We have identified NHR-8, a nuclear hormone receptor involved in the xenobiotic response in Caenorhabditis elegans, as a new regulator of tolerance to IVM. Loss-of-function nhr-8(ok186) C. elegans mutants subjected to larval development assays and electropharyngeogram measurements, displayed hypersensitivity to IVM, and silencing of nhr-8 in IVM-resistant worms increased IVM efficacy. In addition, compared to wild-type worms, nhr-8 mutants under IVM selection pressure failed to acquire tolerance to the drug. In addition, IVM-hypersensitive nhr-8(ok186) worms displayed low transcript levels of several genes from the xenobiotic detoxification network and a concomitant low Pgp-mediated drug efflux activity. Interestingly, some pgp and cyp genes known to impact IVM tolerance in many nematode species, were down regulated in nhr-8 mutants and inversely upregulated in IVM-resistant worms. Moreover, pgp-6 overexpression in nhr-8(ok186) C. elegans increased tolerance to IVM. Importantly, NHR-8 function was rescued in nhr-8(ok186) C. elegans with the homolog of the parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus, and silencing of Hco-nhr-8 by RNAi on L2 H. contortus larvae increased IVM susceptibility in both susceptible and resistant H. contortus isolates. Thus, our data show that NHR-8 controls the tolerance and development of resistance to IVM in C. elegans and the molecular basis for this relates to the NHR-8-mediated upregulation of IVM detoxification genes. Since our results show that Hco-nhr-8 functions similarly to Cel-nhr-8, this study helps to better understand mechanisms underlying failure in drug efficacy and open perspectives in finding new compounds with NHR-8 antagonist activity to potentiate IVM efficacy.
   Author summary IVM is the most important broad-spectrum deworming drug used today but resistance to this drug has appeared in parasites of both animals and humans. This seriously jeopardizes the success of current parasite control. Preserving IVM efficacy is a public health issue, whose outcome depends on the understanding of the molecular basis of selection for resistance to these drugs. We unambiguously show that the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-8, is crucial for protection of the nematode model Caenorhabditis elegans against IVM toxicity. Worms deficient in NHR-8 are hypersensitive to IVM and fail to become resistant to IVM under drug pressure. NHR-8 functions in the parasitic nematode of ruminants Haemonchus contortus and similar mechanisms could occur in other target pathogens. By controlling the xenobiotic detoxification network, NHR-8 may contribute to the biotransformation and elimination of IVM and help to desensitize the worm to the drug. This provides novel molecular targets involved in IVM drug tolerance in parasitic nematodes. Such findings could be exploited for targeted therapeutic intervention to treat parasitic nematode infections and delay the process of resistance development to anthelmintic drugs.

ID MOUSE MODEL; ANKARA MVA; RESPONSES; INFECTION; DNA; COVERAGE; IMMUNITY
AB There are a number of vaccine candidates under development against a small number of the most common outbreak filoviruses all employing the virus glycoprotein (GP) as the vaccine immunogen. However, antibodies induced by such GP vaccines are typically autologous and limited to the other members of the same species. In contrast, T-cell vaccines offer a possibility to design a single pan-filovirus vaccine protecting against all known and even likely existing, but as yet unencountered members of the family. Here, we used a cross-filovirus immunogen based on conserved regions of the filovirus nucleoprotein, matrix and polymerase to construct simian adenovirus- and poxvirus MVA-vectored vaccines, and in a proof-of-concept study demonstrated a protection of the BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice against high, lethal challenges with Ebola and Marburg viruses, two distant members of the family, by vaccine-elicited T cells in the absence of GP antibodies.
   Author summary Development of an effective vaccine against filovirus outbreaks is an important public health aim. Here, we demonstrate the principle that cellular responses can not only protect two strains of mice against a high lethal virus challenge of 1000 LD50 in the absence of glycoprotein antibodies, but a single epigraph T-cell vaccine can do so against distant members of the filovirus family, EBOV and MARV. This suggests a possibility that this candidate vaccine also protects against other known as well as yet unencountered viruses of the filovirus family; it is a pan-filovirus vaccine.

AB Hepatitis C virus (HCV) assembly and envelopment are coordinated by a complex protein interaction network that includes most of the viral structural and nonstructural proteins. While the nonstructural protein 4A (NS4A) is known to be important for viral particle production, the specific function of NS4A in this process is not well understood. We performed mutagenesis of the C-terminal acidic domain of NS4A and found that mutation of several of these amino acids prevented the formation of the viral envelope, and therefore the production of infectious virions, without affecting viral RNA replication. In an overexpression system, we found that NS4A interacted with several viral proteins known to coordinate envelopment, including the viral E1 glycoprotein. One of the NS4A C-terminal mutations, Y45F, disrupted the interaction of NS4A with E1. Specifically, NS4A interacted with the first hydrophobic region of E1, a region previously described as regulating viral particle production. Indeed, we found that an E1 mutation in this region, D72A, also disrupted the interaction of NS4A with E1. Supernatants from HCV NS4A Y45F transfected cells had significantly reduced levels of HCV RNA, however they contained equivalent levels of Core protein. Interestingly, the Core protein secreted from these cells formed high order oligomers with a density matching the infectious virus secreted from wild-type cells. These results suggest that this Y45F mutation in NS4A causes secretion of low-density Core particles lacking genomic HCV RNA. These results corroborate previous findings showing that the E1 D72A mutation also causes secretion of Core complexes lacking genomic HCV RNA, and therefore suggest that the interaction between NS4A and E1 is involved in the incorporation of viral RNA into infectious HCV particles. Our findings define a new role for NS4A in the HCV lifecycle and help elucidate the protein interactions necessary for production of infectious virus.
   Author summary RNA viruses, which encompass both established and emerging pathogens, pose significant public health challenges. Viruses in the family Flaviviridae, including Dengue virus, Zika virus, and hepatitis C virus (HCV), continue to cause morbidity and mortality worldwide. One HCV protein, NS4A, acts in several steps of the viral lifecycle; however, how it contributes to viral particle production is not understood. Here, we investigated the role of one region of NS4A, the C-terminal acidic domain, in regulating the viral lifecycle. We found that amino acids within this domain are important for viral envelopment and the production infectious particles, specifically through interaction with the E1 glycoprotein. NS4A interacts with the first hydrophobic domain of E1. Disruption of this interaction, by either mutation of E1 or NS4A, prevents the production of infectious virus particles and instead results in release of low-density Core protein complexes that lack HCV RNA into the cellular supernatant. Overall, our results reveal that NS4A is important for late stages of the HCV lifecycle and suggest that the interaction between NS4A and E1 may regulate the incorporation of viral RNA into the virion for the formation of infectious HCV particles.

ID DISEASE
AB BackgroundAs the fourth leading cause of death, injury is an important public health concern in Guangdong Province, China. The epidemiological characteristics of injury mortality is changing along with the social development. This study described the epidemiological characteristics of injury mortality in Guangdong Province by analyzing the death surveillance data in a few areas in Guangdong Province in 2015.MethodsUsing the mortality data from the Disease Surveillance Points (DSP) system, injury deaths were classified according to the International Classification of Disease-10th Revision (ICD-10). The data were stratified by areas (urban/rural), gender, age groups, injury types, and then overall and type-specific injury mortality rates were estimated for the whole Guangdong Province, China.ResultsWe estimated that about 38,200 individuals died from injury in Guangdong Province in 2015, producing a mortality rate of 43.11/100,000. The overall age-standardized injury mortality in men was higher in rural areas compared with urban areas (41.29/100,000 versus 24.89/100,000). In terms of injury intent, unintentional injuries were the commonnest injury type, which accounted for 83.93% of the overall injury deaths, however, the deaths caused by suicide should not be ignored, which occupied 12.67% of the total injury deaths. In terms of injury cause type, falls, road-traffic accidents, suicide, drowning, and accidental poisoning were the top five leading types of injury deaths.ConclusionsIn Guangdong Province, injury is an important cause of death. Road-traffic accidents, falls, suicide, drowning, and accidental poisoning should be the priorities of intervention. Moreover, in rural areas, the men were the most targeted subpopulation of the prevention activities.

ID QUALITY
AB Strengthening district-level management may be an important lever for improving key public health outcomes in low-income settings; however, previous studies have not established the statistical associations between better management and primary healthcare system performance in such settings. To explore this gap, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 36 rural districts and 226 health centers in Ethiopia, a country which has made ambitious investment in expanding access to primary care over the last decade. We employed quantitative measure of management capacity at both the district health office and health center levels and used multiple regression models, accounting for clustering of health centers within districts, to estimate the statistical association between management capacity and a key performance indicator (KPI) summary score based on antenatal care coverage, contraception use, skilled birth attendance, infant immunization, and availability of essential medications. In districts with above median district management capacity, health center management capacity was strongly associated (p < 0.05) with KPI performance. In districts with below median management capacity, health center management capacity was not associated with KPI performance. Having more staff at the district health office was also associated with better KPI performance (p < 0.05) but only in districts with above median management capacity. The results suggest that district-level management may provide an opportunity for improving health system performance in low-income country settings.

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID VIRUS DISEASE; FINAL SIZE; TRANSMISSION; LIBERIA; MODELS
AB The unexpected early cessation of the recent West Africa Ebola outbreak demonstrated shortcomings of popular forecasting approaches and has not been fully understood yet. A popular hypothesis is that public health interventions mitigated the spread, such as ETUs and safe burials. We investigate whether risk heterogeneity within the population could serve as an alternative explanation. We introduce a model for spread in heterogeneous host population that is particularly well suited for early predictions due to its simplicity and ease of application. Furthermore, we explore the conditions under which the observed epidemic trajectory can be explained without taking into account the effect of public health interventions. While the obtained fits closely match the total case count time series, closer inspection of sub-population results made us conclude that risk heterogeneity is unlikely to fully explain the early cessation of Ebola; other factors such as behavioral changes and other interventions likely played a major role. More accurate predictions in a future scenario require models that allow for early sub-exponential growth, as well as access to additional data on patient occupation (risk level) and location, to allow identify local phenomena that influence spreading behavior.

AB BackgroundDiphtheria toxin (DT) is produced by toxigenic strains of the human pathogen Corynebacterium diphtheriae as well as zoonotic C. ulcerans and C. pseudotuberculosis. Toxigenic strains may cause severe respiratory diphtheria, myocarditis, neurological damage or cutaneous diphtheria. The DT encoding tox gene is located in a mobile genomic region and tox variability between C. diphtheriae and C. ulcerans has been postulated based on sequences of a few isolates. In contrast, species-specific sequence analysis of the diphtheria toxin repressor gene (dtxR), occurring both in toxigenic and non-toxigenic Corynebacterium species, has not been done yet. We used whole genome sequencing data from 91 toxigenic and 46 non-toxigenic isolates of different pathogenic Corynebacterium species of animal or human origin to elucidate differences in extracted DT, DtxR and tox-surrounding genetic elements by a phylogenetic analysis in a large sample set.ResultsSequences of both DT and DtxR, extracted from whole genome sequencing data, could be classified in four distinct, nearly species-specific clades, corresponding to C. diphtheriae, C. pseudotuberculosis, C. ulcerans and atypical C. ulcerans from a non-toxigenic toxin gene-bearing wildlife cluster. Average amino acid similarities were above 99% for DT and DtxR within the four groups, but lower between them. For DT, subgroups below species level could be identified, correlating with different tox-comprising mobile genetic elements. In most C. diphtheriae, tox genes were located within known prophages. In contrast, in C. ulcerans diverse tox-including mobile elements could be identified: either prophages differing from C. diphtheriae prophages or an alternative pathogenicity island (PAI) described previously. One isolate showed a different, shorter tox-comprising putative PAI. Beyond the tox-overlapping elements, most isolates harbored a variety of additional prophages.ConclusionOur NGS data from 137 isolates indicate the existence of different genetic backgrounds of DT-mediated pathogenicity in different Corynebacterium species and evolution of once acquired pathogenicity features with the strains. Different groups of pathogenicity-related elements within C. ulcerans imply that tox transmission pathways between isolates may differ in the zoonotic species and contribute to their emerging pathogenic potential.

AB BackgroundDue to demographic changes across Europe there are strong political interests in maintaining the labour force by prolonging working life, i.e. increasing retirement age. This may pose both challenges and opportunities for societies, workplaces, and individuals. The SeniorWorkingLife (Danish: SeniorArbejdsLiv) project investigates push and stay mechanisms for labour market participation - now and in the future - among older workers (50years).MethodsIn July 2018, 30,000 Danes age 50 or older (18,000 employed, 7000 unemployed, 3000 voluntary early retirements, 2000 disability pensions) were invited to participate, of which 15,721 (52.4%) replied to the entire questionnaire and 17,885 (59.6%) replied at least in part. Baseline data collection was terminated in October 2018. The questionnaire covers 14 domains in relation to push and stay mechanisms for labour market participation: 1) basic information (demographics, employment status etc.), 2) multiple-choice question covering a wide range of push and stay mechanisms, 3) role of the workplace, 4) age-discrimination, 5) personal economy, 6) possibility for voluntary early retirement among employed and unemployed, 7) gradual retirement, 8) competencies and continued education, 9) return-to-work, 10) new technologies at the workplace, 11) job satisfaction and well-being, 12) working environment, 13) lifestyle, 14) health and functional capacity. The project aspires to repeat the survey as a prospective cohort every 2-3years and to perform longitudinal follow-up in Danish high-quality registers about work and health.DiscussionThe SeniorWorkingLife project will provide important knowledge about push and stay mechanisms for labour market participation among older workers. Push refers to mechanisms that increase the risk of premature exit from the labour marker, e.g. due to poor health, poor working environment, age discrimination, and stay to mechanisms prolonging working life e.g. due to attractive working conditions and a good working environment. The project will also to some degree investigate stuck, pull and jump mechanisms. Collaboration and use of the data for scientific purposes by other researchers are encouraged.

AB BackgroundThis article addresses the enjoyment of the human rights to water and sanitation (HRTWS), in particular access to toilets, in a public school in Bahia, Brazil.MethodsParticipant observation of the school's routine, focus groups with students in grades 8 and 9 of primary school (13 to 17years old) and individual, semi-structured, interviews with members of school staff were applied, exploring access to water and sanitation by adolescent girls and boys.ResultsStudents and school staff reported that the amount of toilets was insufficient and that their conditions were often inadequate because they were plugged or dirty. The impact on girls is greater as toilets do not offer a clean and healthy environment for menstrual hygiene management. Several elements of the normative content of the HRTWS, especially accessibility, acceptability, quality, safety and dignity, were largely not fulfilled. The study identified that, to comply with the HRTWS, it is necessary to go beyond infrastructure, as the lack of maintenance; cultural elements and student participation hinder the usage of sanitary facilities. Since schools can be privileged spaces to train critical and reflective citizens and to foster autonomy and emancipation, education oriented by human rights and citizenship is an opportunity for a more equitable society. By increasing access to social, economic and cultural rights in all phases and aspects of life, including when children and adolescents are in a school environment, people are able to enjoy better living conditions and a higher standard of health.ConclusionsThe study raised the importance of considering each community's sociocultural aspects in analyzing access to sanitary facilities in schools, which are spaces where citizens' rights should be exercised and fulfilled.

AB BackgroundPreventing type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is one of the biggest health challenges currently facing the UK, with the NHS spending 14 billion each year on treating the disease and associated symptoms.AimsThe aim of this study was to determine the public's awareness about the symptoms, risk factors and lifestyle choices, commonly associated with T2DM. This study also aimed to determine whether the level of awareness varies if the questions are asked in different languages, primarily those spoken by ethnic minorities.MethodsThis was a cross sectional, multisite study conducted in London, UK, involving 399 participants, who were non-diabetic, aged between 25 and 74years old and living in one of four selected London boroughs. Descriptive statistics, Chi square and Fisher's Exact Tests were used to highlight and summarise the key findings of this study.ResultsA response rate of 23.7% (n=399/1683) for the English questionnaire was achieved. Overall, 59.4% (n=237/399) of the cohort were able to identify a minimum of three T2DM symptoms and thus, were considered to have adequate or good awareness. Whereas, 60.6% (n=242/399) were able to identify a minimum of six T2DM risk factors and were considered to have adequate or good awareness. More participants could correctly identify that obesity was a risk factor of T2DM when they were asked the question in their spoken language, rather than English (p<0.01). When participants were asked about their current lifestyle choices, there were high levels of inactivity, smoking and alcohol consumption reported.Conclusion Despite approximately half of participants demonstrating adequate or good awareness about the symptoms, risk factors and lifestyle choices commonly associated with T2DM, yet the study still highlights gaps in awareness among the remaining proportion of participants. Future prevention interventions should be tailored to address these existing gaps in awareness.

AB BackgroundKerala, the southern state of India, has experienced sudden rise in the prevalence estimates of diabetes. A cohort study on the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Kerala state thus aptly bridges the lacuna of incidence estimate of T2DM from a population at risk.MethodsA 10-year prospective cohort study was carried out in two urban wards of central Kerala. The individuals who participated in the baseline survey in 2007 were again invited for a follow-up study in 2017. The data was analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for windows (version 21.0). Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Findings are based on the 10-year follow-up data from 869 participants from the cohort.ResultsThe overall follow-up and response rate of the study was 68.9 and86.9% respectively. During the follow-up period, 190 people (21.9%) developed T2DM. The incidence rate of T2DMand impaired fasting glucose (IFG) were 24.5 per 1000 person years and 45.01 per 1000 person years respectively. Nearly 60% of participants with baseline IFG were converted to T2DM group in the follow-up period. Age>45years, family history of T2DM, BMI25kg/m(2) and presence of central obesity emerged as important risk factors for incident T2DM.ConclusionHigh incidence of prediabetes over diabetes observed in this study shows an epidemic trend ofT2DM in Kerala, India. It requires an immediate public health action.

AB BackgroundStigma and discrimination are a significant public health concern and cause great distress to people with mental illness. Healthcare professionals have been identified as one source of this discrimination. In this article we describe the protocol of an international, multisite controlled study, evaluating the effectiveness of READ, an anti-stigma training for medical students towards patients with mental illness. READ aims to improve students' ability to minimise perceived discriminatory behaviours and increase opportunities for patients, therefore developing the ability of future doctors to address and challenge mental illness related discrimination. READ includes components that medical education research has shown to be effective at improving attitudes, beliefs and understanding.Methods/designREAD training was developed using evidence based components associated with changes in stigma related outcomes. The study will take place in multiple international medical schools across high, middle and low income countries forming part of the INDIGO group network, with 25 sites in total. Students will be invited to participate via email from the lead researcher at each site during their psychiatry placement, and will be allocated to an intervention or a control arm according to their local teaching group at each site. READ training will be delivered solely to the intervention arm. Standardised measures will be used to assess students' knowledge, attitudes and skills regarding discrimination in both the intervention and control groups, at baseline and at follow up immediately after the intervention. Statistical analyses of individual-level data will be conducted using random effects models accounting for clustering within sites to investigate changes in mean or percentages of each outcome, at baseline and immediately after the intervention.DiscussionThis is the first international study across high, middle and low income countries, which will evaluate the effectiveness of training for medical students to respond effectively to patients' experiences and anticipation of discrimination. The results will promote implementation of manualised training that will help future doctors to reduce the impact of mental illness related discrimination on their patients. Limitations of the study are also discussed.

AB BackgroundDepression and anxiety is a major public health problem, in Sweden and internationally. Internet-based interventions are increasingly acknowledged as promising approaches for individuals with varying degrees of mental health problems. We present findings from the implementation of myCompass, a fully automated self-guided intervention of Australian origin, in a Swedish context.MethodsWe (i) share our experience of the E-health study platform (i.e., regarding security aspects, functionality) to which the myCompass intervention was linked, and (ii) report findings from the empirical evaluation of myCompass (i.e., prerequisites, execution, study outcomes), in a community sample of individuals (N=837) reporting mild-to-moderate levels of depression, anxiety and stress. Outcomes were calculated with repeated measures ANOVA and linear mixed models.ResultsThe E-health study platform proved to be an efficient tool enabling randomization, informed consent and evaluation to be administered in a fully automated manner. The study rendered substantial interest initially with 1207 individuals enrolling, however it failed to maintain engagement of those enrolled with only few participants logging in more than once or twice following registration. A smaller subgroup of active users (n=35) had a markedly higher activity in the program, however their treatment results were not significantly better than those of the control group.ConclusionBased on the large number of dropouts and also modest use of the intervention overall, only tentative speculations can be made regarding its effectiveness in a Swedish context. The number of individuals remaining active in the intervention is much more limited that the number of individuals initially signing up. Moreover, the transportation of interventions across countries and cultures may need more careful consideration, and pilot-trials before attempting large-scale trials are recommended.Trial registrationMyCompass was retrospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. NCT03659630 September 3rd 2018, and was given the protocol ID 2015/1268-31/2+2016/88.

TI We are always desperate and will try anything to conceive': The
   convoluted and dynamic process of health seeking among women with
   infertility in the West Coast Region of The Gambia
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID PERSPECTIVES; BEHAVIOR; MALARIA; GENDER
AB Introduction
   In many Sub-Saharan African countries, women with infertility search relentlessly for treatment. Guided by the Partners for Applied Social Sciences model for health seeking behaviour and access to care research, this study aims to understand the health seeking behaviour of women with infertility in the West Coast region of The Gambia and the influence of aetiological beliefs on health seeking paths.
   Methodology
   A qualitative approach was used to generate both primary and secondary data for thematic analysis. The data collection methods included in-depth interviews (36), observations (18), informal conversations (42), group discussion (7) and made use of pile-sorting exercises. Sources of secondary data included government and non-governmental reports and media outputs.
   Results
   The health seeking approaches of women living in both rural and urban areas were extremely complex and dynamic, with women reporting that they looked for biomedical treatment as well as seeking indigenous treatment provided by local healers, sacred places and kanyaleng groups. While treatment choice was related to the perceived aetiology of infertility, it was also strongly influenced by the perceived effectiveness of the treatment available and the duration of the fertility problems. Other relevant factors were the affordability, accessibility and availability of treatment and respondents' family and social networks, whereby access to the biomedical health sector was strongly influenced by people's socio-economic background.
   Conclusion
   On the basis of this analysis and our wider research in the area, we see a need for health authorities to further invest in providing information and counselling on issues related to infertility prevention and treatment. The availability of locally applicable guidelines for the management of infertility for both men and women at all levels of the health system would facilitate such work. In addition, the public sphere should provide more space for alternative forms of social identity for both men and women.

AB Among the members of flaviviruses, the Zika virus (ZIKV) remains a potent infectious disease agent, with its associated pandemic prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare it a global public health concern. Thus, rapid and accurate diagnosis of the ZIKV is needed. In this study, we report a new immunofluorescence biosensor for the detection of nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of the ZIKV, which operates using the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) signal from plasmonic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to amplify the fluorescence intensity signal of quantum dots (QDs) within an antigen-antibody detection process. The LSPR signal from the AuNPs was used to amplify the fluorescence intensity of the QDs. For ultrasensitive, rapid, and quantitative detection of NS1 of the ZIKV, four different thiol-capped AuNPs were investigated. Our biosensor could detect the ZIKV in a wide concentration range from 10-10(7) RNA copies/mL, and we found that the limit of detection (LOD) for the ZIKV followed the order Ab-(L)-cysteine-AuNPs (LOD = 8.2 copies/mL) > Ab-3-mercaptopropionic acid-AuNPs (LOD = 35.0 copies/mL). Immunofluorescence biosensor for NS1 exhibited excellent specificity against other negative control targets and could also detect the ZIKV in human serum.

AB BackgroundThe Swiss Federal Office of Public Health has recommended vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) to prevent cervical cancer since 2008. To establish monitoring of the future public health impact of vaccination, baseline population-based data are required. The objectives of this study were to examine the distribution of oncogenic HPV genotypes in biopsies with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia stage 3 or more severe lesions (CIN3+) at the beginning of HPV vaccination programmes and to compare sociodemographic and behavioural factors of women with CIN3+ with women in the Swiss general population.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective and prospective cross-sectional study with women diagnosed with CIN3+ in Switzerland. Ten pathology institutes from six cantons and three language regions participated. We conducted HPV typing on formaldehyde fixed-paraffin embedded specimens from 2014 and 2015. Women enrolled in 2015 were asked to complete a questionnaire. We described frequencies of HPV types. We also compared demographic characteristics and socioeconomic status in the CIN3+plus group with the Swiss National Cohort in 2014 and compared risk factors for HPV infection with the Swiss Health Survey in 2012.ResultsWe included 768 biopsies from 767 women. Four hundred and seventy-five (61.8%) biopsies were positive for HPV 16 and/or 18, 687 (89.5%) were positive for oncogenic HPV genotypes 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and/or 58 and five (0.7%) were HPV negative. Twenty-eight (10.3%) of the 273 women who completed the patient questionnaire reported having received at least one dose of an HPV vaccine. When compared with Swiss women in the six study cantons, fewer women in the CIN3+plus study group were of Swiss nationality, more were born abroad and more were single. The study group also had a higher proportion of women with 2 partners in the last year, current smokers and was younger at age of first sexual intercourse.ConclusionsIntroduction of the nonavalent vaccine could cover approximately 90% of CIN3+ lesions in Swiss women compared with around 60% with the quadrivalent vaccine. Surveillance of HPV genotype distribution in CIN3+, together with information about vaccination and CIN3+ incidence will allow monitoring of the public health impact of vaccination programmes.Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02323997.

AB BackgroundPhysical activity (PA) has demonstrated a decreased risk in various cancers and other chronic diseases; however, rural residents are less likely to attain recommended levels of PA compared to urban and suburban counterparts. Given rural residents make up 15% of the United States population, there is a need for novel approaches to increase PA among this population. The goal of the present study is to investigate the effectiveness of a multilevel intervention to increase PA rates among rural residents.Methods/designGuided by an ecological framework, a group-randomized design will be used to evaluate the effects of a three-level intervention for increasing PA among adult residents residing in 6 rural communities (n=600) along with 6 control communities (n=600). The intervention includes components at the individual (short message service [SMS] text messages), interpersonal (social support in walking groups), and community levels (events at existing trails). Innovative methods to encourage participation will be employed as well as a focus on life priorities (family, recreation, hobbies) other than health. Aim 1 includes a literature review and key informant interviews to determine the local contexts for intervention adaptation. Aim 2 will employ a set of interventions at the individual, interpersonal, and community-levels to evaluate their impact on moderate-to-vigorous PA as measured by self-reported (telephone survey) and objectively assessed (accelerometry) measures. These data are supplemented by location based on Global Positioning System and community audits, which provide information on recreational amenities, programs/policies, and street segments.DiscussionThis study is among the first of its kind to test a multilevel intervention in a rural setting, address life priorities that compliment health outcomes, and examine moderation between behavioral interventions and the natural environments where people are physically active. Our results will influence the field by enhancing the ability to scale-up innovative, PA interventions with the potential to reach high-risk, rural populations.Trial registrationClinical Trials NCT03683173, September 25, 2018.

AB BackgroundPolicy making in healthcare requires reliable and local data. Different sources of coverage data for health interventions can be utilized to populate the Lives Saved Tool (LiST), a commonly used policy-planning tool for women and children's health. We have evaluated four existing sources of antenatal care data in Palestine to discuss the implications of their use in LiST.MethodsWe identified all intervention coverage and health status indicators around the antenatal period that could be used to populate LiST. These indicators were calculated from 1) routine reported data, 2) a Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), 3) paper-based antenatal records and 4) the eRegistry (an electronic health information system) for public clinics in the West Bank, Palestine for the most recent year available. We scaled coverage of each indicator to 90%, in public clinics only, and compared this to a no-change scenario for a seven-year period.ResultsEight intervention coverage and health status indicators needed to populate the antenatal section of LiST could be calculated from both paper-based antenatal records and the eRegistry. Only two could be calculated from routine reports and three from a national survey. Maternal lives saved over seven years ranged from 5 to 39, with percent reduction in the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) ranging from 1 to 6%. Pre-eclampsia management accounted for 25 to 100% of these lives saved.ConclusionsThe choice of data source for antenatal indicators will affect policy-based decisions when used to populate LiST. Although all data sources have their purpose, clinical data collected directly in an electronic registry during antenatal contacts may provide the most reliable and complete data to populate currently unavailable but needed indicators around specific antenatal care interventions.

AB BackgroundPopulation ageing is an increasingly severe global issue. And this has been posing challenges for public health policies and medical resource allocation There are various features of population ageing in different regions worldwide.MethodsAll data were obtained from the health data of World Bank Open Data. Quantile linear regression was used to subtly measure the common variation tendency and strength of the global ageing rate and ageing population. The Bayesian space-time hierarchy model (BSTHM) was employed to assess the detailed spatial temporal evolution of ageing rate and ageing population in global 195 countries and regions.ResultsAnnual growth of the ageing (65 and above) rate occurred on six continents: Europe (0.1532%), Oceania (0.0873%), Asia (0.0834%), South America (0.0723%), North America (0.0673%) and Africa (0.0069%). The coefficient of variation of the global ageing rate increased from 0.54 in 1960 to 0.69 in 2017. The global ageing rate and ageing population increased over this period, correlating positively with their quantiles. Most countries (37/39) in Europe belong to the top level with regard to the ageing rate, including the countries with the greatest degree of ageingSweden, Germany, Austria, Belgium and the UKwhose spatial relative risks of ageing are 3.180 (3.113-3.214), 3.071 (3.018-3.122), 2.951 (2.903-3.001), 2.932 (2.880-2.984) and 2.917 (2.869-2.967), respectively. Worldwide, 44 low ageing areas which were distributed mainly in Africa (26 areas) and Asia (15 areas) experienced a decreasing trend of ageing rates. The local trends of ageing population in the 195 areas increased.ConclusionsThe differentiation of global population ageing is becoming increasingly serious. Globally, all 195 areas showed an increasing local ageing trend in absolute terms, although there were 44 low-ageing areas that experienced a decreasing local trend of ageing rate. The statistical results may provide some baseline reference for developing public health policies in various countries or regions, especially in less-developed areas.

AB BackgroundBullying in the workplace is a serious public health issue. As a chronic work stress, workplace bullying places the victims' physical and mental health at risk which, in extreme cases, may lead to suicidal ideation. The high prevalence rate of workplace bullying has been reported and documented globally. However, a major limitation of the existing literature is that studies essentially focus on the consequences of workplace bullying on victims, including the psychological, physiological and socioeconomic impacts, and on the factors causing workplace bullying, but research on the impact of workplace bullying on the victims' families is lacking. It is however evident that the consequences of workplace bullying have a spillover effect on the victims' family members. Since many victims have children and given that children are particularly vulnerable to a negative family environment, examining the impacts of the type of parental stress induced by workplace bullying on children's health including physical and psychological health (depression and self-esteem), externalizing problem behaviors (aggression, lying, disrespect) and school adjustment (academic performance and school conduct) is urgently needed. The overall aim of this study is to examine how health, externalizing problem behaviors and school adjustment of children whose parents are victims of workplace bullying may be associated with the impact that workplace bullying has on parenting practices.MethodsIt is a longitudinal study. Quantitative data will be collected from multi-informants, including currently employed Chinese parents, their children aged between 6 and 12years old, and their class teachers at two time points, separated by a 1-year interval. One primary school will be recruited from each district of Hong Kong including participants with different socioeconomic backgrounds. At least 837 dyads (parents and children) from 18 primary schools will join the study.DiscussionWorkplace bullying not only affects victims but can also be harmful to their families as it alters the victims temper in the family environment. Results will be informative for the government and corporations to make concerted efforts and find strategies to prevent workplace bullying and to heighten the awareness of the importance of promoting safe and respectful workplaces for workers.

AB Background
   Decreasing sedentary behaviour (SB) has emerged as a public health priority since prolonged sitting increases the risk of non-communicable diseases. Mostly, the independent association of factors with SB has been investigated, although lifestyle behaviours are conditioned by interdependent factors. Within the DEDIPAC Knowledge Hub, a system of sedentary behaviours (SOS)-framework was created to take interdependency among multiple factors into account. The SOS framework is based on a system approach and was developed by combining evidence synthesis and expert consensus. The present study conducted a Bayesian network analysis to investigate and map the interdependencies between factors associated with SB through the life-course from large scale empirical data.
   Methods
   Data from the Eurobarometer survey (80.2, 2013) that included the International physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ) short as well as socio-demographic information and questions on perceived environment, health, and psychosocial information were enriched with macrolevel data from the Eurostat database. Overall, 33 factors were identified aligned to the SOS-framework to represent six clusters on the individual or regional level: 1) physical health and wellbeing, 2) social and cultural context, 3) built and natural environment, 4) psychology and behaviour, 5) institutional and home settings, 6) policy and economics. A Bayesian network analysis was conducted to investigate conditional associations among all factors and to determine their importance within these networks. Bayesian networks were estimated for the complete (23,865 EU-citizens with complete data) sample and for sexand four age-specific subgroups. Distance and centrality were calculated to determine importance of factors within each network around SB.
   Results
   In the young (15-25), adult (26-44), and middle-aged (45-64) groups occupational level was directly associated with SB for both, men and women. Consistently, social class and educational level were indirectly associated within male adult groups, while in women factors of the family context were indirectly associated with SB. Only in older adults, factors of the built environment were relevant with regard to SB, while factors of the home and institutional settings were less important compared to younger age groups.
   Conclusion
   Factors of the home and institutional settings as well as the social and cultural context were found to be important in the network of associations around SB supporting the priority for future research in these clusters. Particularly, occupational status was found to be the main driver of SB through the life-course. Investigating conditional associations by Bayesian networks gave a better understanding of the complex interplay of factors being associated with SB. This may provide detailed insights in the mechanisms behind the burden of SB to effectively inform policy makers for detailed intervention planning. However, considering the complexity of the issue, there is need for a more comprehensive system of data collection including objective measures of sedentary time.

AB Misinformation poses significant challenges to evidence-based practice. In the public health domain specifically, treatment misinformation can lead to opportunity costs or direct harm. Alas, attempts to debunk misinformation have proven sub-optimal, and have even been shown to "backfire", including increasing misperceptions. Thus, optimized debunking strategies have been developed to more effectively combat misinformation. The aim of this study was to test these strategies in a real-world setting, targeting misinformation about autism interventions. In the context of professional development training, we randomly assigned participants to an "optimized-debunking" or a "treatment-as-usual" training condition and compared support for non-empirically-supported treatments before, after, and six weeks following completion of online training. Results demonstrated greater benefits of optimized debunking immediately after training; thus, the implemented strategies can serve as a general and flexible debunking template. However, the effect was not sustained at follow-up, highlighting the need for further research into strategies for sustained change.

AB Background: A sizeable fraction of tuberculosis (TB) cases go undiagnosed. By analysing data from enhanced demographic, microbiological and geospatial surveillance of TB registrations, we aimed to identify modifiable predictors of inequitable access to diagnosis and care.
   Methods: Governmental community health workers (CHW) enumerated all households in 315 catchment areas during October-December 2015. From January 2015, government TB Officers routinely implemented enhanced TB surveillance at all public and private TB treatment registration centres within Blantyre (18 clinics in total). This included collection from registering TB patients of demographic and clinical characteristics, a single sputum sample for TB microscopy and culture, and geolocation of place of residence using an electronic satellite map application. We estimated catchment area annual TB case notification rates (CNRs), stratified by microbiological status. To identify population and area-level factors predictive of CHW catchment area TB case notification rates, we constructed Bayesian spatially autocorrelated regression models with Poisson response distributions. Worldpop data were used to estimate poverty.
   Results: In total, the 315 CHW catchment areas comprised 753,489 people (range 162 to 13,066 people/catchment area). Between 2015 and 2017, 6077 TB cases (61% male; 99% HIV tested; 67% HIV positive; 55% culture confirmed) were geolocated, with 3723 (61%) resident within a CHW catchment area. In adjusted models, greater distance to the nearest TB registration clinic was negatively correlated with TB CNRs, which halved for every 3.2-fold (95% CI 2.24-5.21) increase in distance. Poverty, which increased with distance from clinics, was negatively correlated with TB CNRs; a 23% increase (95% CI 17-34%) in the mean percentage of the population living on less than US$ 2 per day corresponded to a halving of the TB case notification rates.
   Conclusions: Using enhanced surveillance of TB cases in Blantyre, we show an ecological relationship consistent with an 'inverse care law' whereby poorer neighbourhoods and those furthest from TB clinics have lower relative CNRs. If confirmed as low case detection, then pro-poor strategies to facilitate equitable access to TB diagnosis and treatment are required.

TI Magnitude of road traffic accident related injuries and fatalities in
   Ethiopia
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID GENDER
AB Background
   In many developing countries there is paucity of evidence regarding the epidemiology of road traffic accidents (RTAs). The study determines the rates of injuries and fatalities associated with RTAs in Ethiopia based on the data of a recent national survey.
   Methods
   The study is based on the secondary data of the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey conducted in 2016. The survey collected information about occurrence injuries and accidents including RTAs in the past 12 months among 75,271 members of 16,650 households. Households were selected from nine regions and two city administrations of Ethiopia using stratified cluster sampling procedure.
   Results
   Of the 75,271 household members enumerated, 123 encountered RTAs in the reference period and rate of RTA-related injury was 163 (95% confidence interval (CI): 136-195) per 100,000 population. Of the 123 causalities, 28 were fatal, making the fatality rate 37 (95% CI: 25-54) per 100,000 population. The RTA-related injuries and fatalities per 100,000 motor vehicles were estimated as 21,681 (95% CI: 18,090-25,938) and 4,922 (95% CI: 3325-7183), respectively. Next to accidental falls, RTAs were the second most common form of accidents and injuries accounting for 22.8% of all such incidents. RTAs contributed to 43.8% of all fatalities secondary to accidents and injuries. Among RTA causalities, 21.9% were drivers, 35.0% were passenger vehicle occupants and 36.0% were vulnerable road users including: motorcyclists (21.0%), pedestrians (12.1%) and cyclists (2.9%). Approximately half (47.1%) of the causalities were between 15-29 years of age and 15.3% were either minors younger than 15 years or seniors older than 64 years of age. Nearly two-thirds (65.0%) of the victims were males.
   Conclusion
   RTA-related causalities are extremely high in Ethiopia. Male young adults and vulnerable road users are at increased risk of RTAs. There is a urgent need for bringing road safety to the country's public health agenda.

AB Satisfaction with childbirth services is a multi-dimensional phenomenon, providing relevant insights into women's opinion on quality of services received. Research studies report a dearth of standardised scales that quantify this phenomenon; and none have been tested in India to the best of authors' knowledge. The current study was undertaken to evaluate psychometric properties of Hindi version of the Turkish Scale for Measuring Maternal Satisfaction: Normal and Caesarean Births versions in order to fill this gap. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in selected public health facilities in Chhattisgarh, India. Healthy women (n = 1004) who gave birth to a single, live neonate, vaginally or via Caesarean section participated. Psychometric assessment was carried out in four steps: 1) scales translated from Turkish to Hindi; 2) Content Validity Index scores calculated for Hindi scales; 3) data collection; 4) statistical analyses for Hindi scales (Normal and Caesarean Birth).
   A 10-factor model with 36 items emerged for both scales. The Hindi-translated Normal Birth and Caesarean Birth scales had good internal reliability (Cronbach's a coefficients of 0.85 and 0.80, respectively).
   The Hindi Scales for Measuring Maternal Satisfaction (Normal and Caesarean Birth) are valid and reliable tools for utilization in Indian health facilities. Their multi-dimensional nature presents an opportunity for the care providers and health administrators to incorporate women's opinions in intervention to improve quality of childbirth services. Having an international tool validated within India also provides a platform for comparing cross-country findings.

AB Purpose
   Myopia is increasing worldwide and possibly linked to education. In this study, we analyse the association of myopia and education in the U.S. and investigate its age-dependency.
   Methods
   We conducted a secondary data analysis using the public use files from the cross-sectional study National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of the period from 1999 to 2008. 19,756 participants aged 20 to 85 years were included with data on education and ophthalmic parameters (distance visual acuity, objective refraction and keratometry). Spherical equivalent, astigmatism, corneal power and corneal astigmatism were evaluated for an association with education using linear regression analysis with adjustment of potential confounders.
   Results
   Analysis revealed an association between spherical equivalent and educational level in the univariate analysis (P <.001), and in the adjusted model (P <.001). Subjects who attend school to less than 9th grade had a mean spherical equivalent of 0.34 D, subjects with 9-11th grade -0.14 D, subjects that finished high school -0.33 D, subjects with partial college education -0.70 D, subjects that graduated from college or a higher formal education -1.22 D. Subjects that graduated from college or above were -1.47 D more myopic compared to subjects that completed less than 9 th grade school in the adjusted analyses. Astigmatism and corneal curvature was not associated with education.
   Conclusions
   Myopia is associated with higher education in the U. S. Our analysis shows that corneal curvature does not contribute to this association, therefore axial elongation or lens power are likely to contribute to myopia.

AB BackgroundTelemonitoring services could dramatically improve the care of diabetes patients by enhancing their quality of life while decreasing healthcare expenditures. However, the potential for implementing innovative treatment options in the Austrian public and private health system is not known yet. Thus, we analyzed the readiness to use telemonitoring in diabetes care among Austrian practitioners.MethodsWe conducted an online survey among a purposive sample of Austrian practitioners (n=41) using an adapted German version of the practitioner telehealth readiness assessment tool. We assessed three readiness domains for telemonitoring in the context of diabetes care, i.e. core readiness, engagement readiness, and structural readiness, and validated the German tool using principal components analysis.ResultsStudy subjects perceived themselves as open to innovations and also expressed optimistic attitudes towards telemonitoring in general and offering telemonitoring-based services for their patients. Participants achieved a medium average readiness level for telemonitoring (58.2, 95% CI 53.9-62.5) and were thus in a good position to use telemonitoring, although some arguments may adversely affected its use. The top three perceived benefits of telemonitoring were enhanced quality of treatment, better therapy adjustment, and reduced travel and waiting times for patients. The top three barriers were reduced personal communication, practitioner time expenditure and equally placed poor financial compensation as well as data security and privacy issues.ConclusionOur data revealed that Austrian practitioners showed a quite moderate readiness to use telemonitoring in diabetes care. To further advance telemonitoring readiness among all pillars of diabetes care in Austria, joint efforts among healthcare stakeholders are required to overcome existing financial, organizational, and technical obstacles.

AB BackgroundIt is widely accepted that oral health plays an important role in overall health. Both dental and medical students are expected to possess good oral health awareness and work together for public oral health promotion especially in developing countries like China. The aim of this study was to assess the oral health knowledge, behavior and status of dental and medical undergraduate students in the first (fresh) and third year (before specialized courses) study.MethodsA self-administered structured questionnaire with 13 questions was designed based on oral health knowledge, behavior and status and a cross-sectional study was conducted among the 1st, 3rd year dental students (1DS, 3DS) and medical students (1MS, 3MS) of Sichuan University in Chengdu, China, in the period of September-December 2017. The data was analyzed by chi-square test using IBM SPSS Statistics v. 21.0.ResultsThe oral health behavior, consciousness and status of the 1st, 3rd year medical and dental students were not optimistic. Dental freshmen were slightly superior to the medical ones in terms of the brushing methods and the awareness of oral disease-systemic disease relationship. The junior dental students showed highly significant improvement than their counterparts, mainly in the items about frequency of brushing teeth, brushing methods of vertical scrub or Bass technique (66.3%), usage of floss or mouth wash (49.7%), causes of caries, periodontal diseases and system diseases (56.9-83.4%). The rates mentioned above were 36.1, 15.8%, 26.7-43.6% among 3MS, respectively. In terms of oral health status, significant differences were only observed in junior students. The prevalence rates of bad breath, gum bleeding, and tooth discoloration among 3DS were obviously lower than those of 3MS. However, only a total of 17.2% junior students had a good oral health, including 23.8% dental students and 11.4% medical students.ConclusionsOur study provided a new understanding of oral health knowledge, behavior and status among dental and medical students, which may help to promote the reform of oral health education and establish a model for clinicians and dentists to work together for improving oral health.

AB BackgroundTo describe the identification, adaptation, and testing of an evidence-based pediatric weight management program for a health disparate community.MethodsA community advisory board (CAB) of decision-makers and staff from local health care, public health, and recreation organizations engaged with academic partners to select an evidence-based program (EBP) for local implementation. Three EBPs were identified (Traffic Light, Bright Bodies, Golan and colleagues Home Environmental Model) and each EBP was rated on program characteristics, implementation and adaptation, and adoptability. Following selection of the EBP that was rated highest, the POPS-CAB made adaptations based on the program principles described in peer-reviewed publications. The adapted intervention, iChoose, was then pilot tested in 3 iterative phases delivered initially by research partners, then co-delivered by research and community partners, then delivered by community partners. The RE-AIM framework was used to plan and evaluate the iChoose intervention across all waves with assessments at baseline, post program (3months), and follow-up (6months).ResultsBright Bodies rated highest on program characteristics and adoptability (p's<0.05), while Home Environmental Model rated highest on implementation factors (p<0.05). Qualitatively, the selection focused on important program characteristics and on matching those characteristics to the potential to fit within the community partner services. The adapted programiChoosehad 18% reach and with participants that were representative of the target population on age, gender, ethnicity, and race. Effectiveness was demonstrated by modest, but significant reductions in BMI z-scores at post-program compared to baseline (M=-0.047; t=-2.11, p=0.046). This decrease returned to values similar to baseline 3months (M=0.009) after the program was completed. Implementation fidelity was high and implementation fidelity did not differ between community or research delivery agents.ConclusionThe process to help organizations identify and select evidence-based programs appropriate for their community led to consensus on a single EBP. While iChoose was successful in initiating changes in BMI z-scores, could be implemented in a low resource community with fidelity, it was insufficient to lead to sustained child BMI z-scores. In response to these data, maintenance of program effects and delivery are the current focus of the CBPR team.

TI A review of surrogate motherhood regulation in south American countries:
   pointing to a need for an international legal framework
SO BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
LA English
DT Review
DE Surrogacy; Commercial surrogacy; Latin America; Infertility; Advanced
   reproductive technology
AB Background: Advances in science and technology coupled with globalization are changing access to and utilization of reproductive health services. This includes the transnational phenomenon of families who use surrogate mothers to reproduce, with forms of altruistic and commercial surrogacy becoming more commonplace. Simultaneously, changes in law, regulation, and policy are necessary to protect surrogates, intended parents, and resulting children. These developments have been slow to adapt to challenges inherent to surrogacy arrangements, most specifically in low- and middle-income countries, including in South American countries.
   Methods: We conducted an interdisciplinary non-systematic literature review and legal analysis of existing and pending policy, laws, and regulations related to commercial surrogacy arrangements in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The review focused on articles that discussed topics of domestic and international law, policy, regulation, and governance related to commercial surrogacy. We queried PubMed, JSTOR, and Google Scholar for Spanish and English-language articles limited to those published between 2000 and 2016.
   Results: Our literature and legal review found a wide variance in how different countries address the issue, including two (Brazil and Uruguay) that have issued guidance attempting to clarify the legality of commercial surrogacy, others who have introduced surrogacy-specific legislation, and a final group with no specific legal mechanisms in place. Our extracted legal case studies also indicate that courts have a hard time interpreting existing law and its applicability to surrogacy. The influence of Catholicism also played a role in the adoption of surrogacy and other advanced reproductive technology (ART)-related legislation.
   Conclusions: Changes in global infertility rates, the emergence of new family structures, and advancement of ART are factors that will influence future development of legal frameworks addressing surrogacy in South America. Despite a growing transnational market for commercial surrogacy in many of the countries examined, the current patchwork of policy does little to clarify what forms of surrogacy are legally permissible, nor do they adequately protect surrogates, intended parents, or the children themselves. This points to an urgent need for regional legal and policy harmonization specifically designed to align with public health and human rights principles.

ID VICTIMIZATION; NORMS
AB Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant public health issue that affects one in three women globally and a similarly large number of women in Nepal. Although important policy and programmatic steps have been taken to address violence against women in Nepal over the past decade, there is still a gap on IPV research in Nepal, particularly with regard to social norms.
   Methods: This mixed-methods study used in-depth interviews with women and their husbands as well as baseline survey data from a cluster randomized trial testing a primary prevention intervention for IPV to examine the prevalence and risk factors for IPV. Baseline survey data included 1800 women from Nawalparasi, Chitwan, and Kapilvastu districts in Nepal. Multivariate regression was used to identify risk and protective factors for exposure to physical and / or sexual IPV in the prior 12 months. Case-based analysis was used to analyze one of 18 pairs of in-depth interviews to examine risk and protective factors within marriages.
   Results: Of 1800 eligible participants, 455 (25.28%) were exposed to IPV. In multivariate analyses, low caste, wife employment, income stress, poor marital communication, quarrelling, husband drunkenness, exposure to IPV as a child, in-law violence, and gender inequitable normative expectations were associated with IPV. The selected case interview represented common themes identified in the analysis including the wife's exposure to violence as a child, husband alcohol use, and marital quarrelling.
   Conclusions: Gender inequitable norms in the community and the intergenerational transmission of attitudes and behaviors supportive of IPV are important to address in intervention measures.

AB The emergence of biomedical and seroadaptive HIV prevention strategies has coincided with a decline in condom use among gay men.
   We undertook a social ecological analysis of condom use and perceptions using nineteen semi-structured interviews with HIV negative gay men in Vancouver, Canada who used HAART-based prevention strategies.
   Contributors to inconsistent condom use were found at various levels of the social ecological model. Ongoing concern regarding HIV transmission and belief in the proven efficacy of condoms motivated contextual use. When condoms were not used, participants utilized seroadaptive and biomedical prevention strategies to mitigate risk.
   These findings indicate that notions of "safety" and "risk" based on consistent condom use are eroding as other modes of prevention gain visibility. Community-based and public health interventions will need to shift prevention messaging from advocacy for universal condom use toward combination prevention in order to meet gay men's current prevention needs. Interventions should advance gay men's communication and self-advocacy skills in order to optimize these strategies.

AB Vitamin D levels may differ between migrant and non-migrant populations, especially among non-western immigrants living in a country with limited sun exposure such as Germany. This study examined serum vitamin D concentration and associated factors among Berliners with and without Turkish background.
   Two samples (with and without Turkish roots) were recruited in the inner city of Berlin for a cross-sectional study assessing serum vitamin D concentration. Linear regression analyses were used to examine sociodemographic, lifestyle and medical factors associated with serum vitamin D levels.
   In the analyses, we included 537 subjects (39% men and 61% women, age 43.2 +/- 12.5 (mean +/- standard deviation) years) with and 112 without Turkish background (46% men and 54% women, age 46.7 +/- 14.6 years). The Turkish sample had lower mean (95%-Confidence Interval) vitamin D levels than the non-Turkish sample: 22.7 nmol/L (21.5;23.9) vs 34.7 nmol/L (31.9;37.5), p < 0.001. In the Turkish female subgroup, veiled women had considerably lower levels than unveiled women: 14.4 nmol/L (11.5;17.3) vs 24.9 nmol/L (23.1;26.7), p < 0.001. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that among the Berliners of Turkish descent, being active less than 150 min per day, and being overweight/obese were independently associated with a lower vitamin D concentration. In the non-migrant sample besides being overweight and obese, female sex was associated with lower vitamin D concentrations.
   Serum vitamin D levels were considerably low in Berliners of Turkish descent, and especially in veiled women. Potentially modifiable factors of low vitamin D levels were high BMI and low physical activity. These findings should be considered in the development of future public health strategies for subpopulations with Turkish migration background.

AB Sexual behavior of HIV positive individuals visiting anti- retroviral clinics is a neglected issue. With access to anti-retroviral treatment, HIV positive individuals experience improved health and are able to reintegrate into their social life and many of them engage in sexual activities. In the context of Ethiopia, safer sex practices among people living with HIV is critical in terms of preventing the acquisition of another strain of HIV and helping address the epidemic.
   An institution-based cross sectional study was conducted at Addis Ababa public hospitals from January to February 2017. A pretested structured questionnaire was used to collect the data. Using the systematic random sampling technique, a total of 562 respondents participated in the study. The data were entered into EPI info version 3.5.3 and transferred to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Descriptive statistics, bi-variate, and multi variable analyses were done. A p-value < 0.05 was considered to determine the statistical significance of the association between factors (independent variables) and risky sexual practice. The Odds ratio was also used to determine the presence and the degree of association between dependent and independent variables.
   A total of 562 respondents participated in the study which revealed that the prevalence of risky sexual practice was 39.1% (95% CI: 35.2, 43.8) three months prior to the data collection. Educational status of participants who were below grade eight (AOR = 2.27, 95% CI:1.01,5.10) and went to grades eight to twelve (AOR = 2.12, 95% CI:1.02,4.41), were married (AOR = 2.07, 95% CI:1.06,4.02), had no concern for safer sexual practice (AOR = 3.74, 95% CI:2.28, 6.13), had CD4 count of >= 500cells/mm(3)(AOR = 1.66, 95% CI:1.04, 2.64), and used substance (AOR = 3.41, 95% CI:1.83, 6.35) were significantly associated with risky sexual practice.
   The prevalence of risky sexual practice was markedly high in this study due to such contributory factors as low educational status, marriage, lack of concern for safer sexual practices, and substance use.

AB Cystic echinococcosis (CE), a neglected zoonosis caused by the larval stage of the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus, remains a public health issue in many developing countries that practice extensive sheep breeding. Control of CE is difficult and requires a community-based integrated approach. We assessed the communities' knowledge and perception of CE, its animal hosts, and its control in a CE endemic area of the High Atlas Mountains, Morocco.
   We conducted twenty focus group discussions (FGDs) stratified by gender with villagers, butchers and students in ten Berber villages that were purposefully selected for their CE prevalence.
   This community considers CE to be a severe and relatively common disease in humans and animals but has a poor understanding of the parasite's life cycle. Risk behaviour and disabling factors for disease control are mainly related to cultural practices in sheep breeding and home slaughtering, dog keeping, and offal disposal at home, as well as in slaughterhouses. Participants in our focus group discussions were supportive of control measures as management of canine populations, waste disposal, and monitoring of slaughterhouses.
   The uncontrolled stray dog population and dogs having access to offal (both at village dumps and slaughterhouses) suggest that authorities should be more closely involved in CE control. This study also highlights the need for improved knowledge about the transmission cycle of the parasite among communities and health professionals. Inter-sectoral collaboration between health staff, veterinarians, and social scientists appears to be crucial for sustainable control of this parasitic zoonosis.

AB The epidemiological characteristics of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the autonomous region of Xinjiang Uygur have been largely unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence and demographic risk factors of SCD in Xinjiang, China.
   This retrospective study reviewed medical records from 11 regions in Xinjiang with different geography (north and south of the Tian Shan mountain range), gross domestic product, and ethnicity (Han, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Hui). SCD was defined as unexpected death due to cardiac reasons within 1 hour after the onset of acute symptoms, including sudden death, unexpected death, and nonviolent death. Monitoring was conducted throughout 2015. Demographic and mortality data were recorded and age-adjusted standardized risk ratio (SRR) was analyzed.
   Among 3,224,103 residents, there were 13,308 all-cause deaths and 1244 events of SCD (784 men and 460 women; overall incidence 38.6 per 100,000 residents). SCD was associated with age (chi 2 = 2105.3), but not geography. Men had an increased risk of SCD compared with women (SRR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.10-2.79). The risk of SCD was highest in residents of the Uyghur (SRR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.05-2.42) and Kazakh (SRR: 1.92, 95% CI: 1.29-2.87) compared with those of the Han. Poor economic development was associated with elevated risk of SCD (SRR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.02-2.38).
   SCD is an important public health issue in China. Our understanding of the demographic differences on SCD in Xinjiang, China may improve the risk stratification and management to reduce the incidence and lethality of SCD.

AB BackgroundRepresenting 60% of medical consultations in Switzerland, primary care holds an important place in our medical system. Patients' values in family medicine (FM) are nowadays recognized as important factors to take into account in order to provide good quality of care. The aim of this study is to describe patients' most important values regarding FM and to assess their associations with socio-demographics factors in a fee-for-services health system.MethodsWe analyzed the Swiss 2012 study on Quality and Costs of Primary Care (QUALICOPC). Two-hundred patients, randomly drawn, answered a questionnaire about their values regarding FM just after their consultation. Explored values were related to communication and patient-centeredness care, continuity and coordination, care access, and patients' activation. We described values reaching more than 50% of very important. Then, multivariate analyses were performed for the most important value of each dimension.ResultsItems related to communication and patient-centeredness care and coordination and continuity of care are the most recurrently mentioned as very important. Items related to access and patients' activation are generally declared as very important by less than 50% of patients. Whatever the domain and the item, women systematically grant items more often as very important than men. Variations are observed according to the age, and the presence or not of a chronic disease.ConclusionSuch dimensions should be subject to a special attention by general practitioners and public health authorities as it might enhance the quality of care and the patients' satisfaction.

AB BackgroundThe number of frail elderly will increase as the world population ageing accelerates. Since frail elders are at risk of falls, hospitalizations and disabilities, they will require more health care and services. To assess frailty prevalence using health administrative databases, to examine the association between frailty and the use of medical services and to measure the excess use of health services following a non-hip fracture across frailty levels among community-dwelling seniors.MethodsA population-based cohort study was built from the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System, including men and women 65years old, non-institutionalized in the pre-fracture year. Frailty was measured using the Elders Risk Assessment (ERA) index. Multivariate Generalized Estimating Equation models were used to examine the relationship between frailty levels and health services while adjusting for covariates. The excess numbers of visits to Emergency Departments (ED) and to Primary Care Practitioners (PCP) as well as hospitalizations were also estimated.ResultsThe cohort included 178,304 fractures. There were 13.6 and 5.2% frail and robust seniors, respectively. In the post-fracture year, the risks of ED visits, PCP visits and hospitalizations, were significantly higher in frail vs. non-frail seniors: adjusted relative risk (RR)=2.69 [95% CI: 2.50-2.90] for ED visits, RR=1.28 [95% CI: 1.23-1.32] for PCP visits and RR=2.34 [95% CI: 2.14-2.55] for hospitalizations.ConclusionOur results suggest that it is possible to characterize seniors' frailty status at a population level using health administrative databases. Furthermore, this study shows that non-institutionalized frail seniors require more health services after an incident fracture. Screening for frailty in seniors should be part of clinical management in order to identify those at a higher risk of needing health services.

AB BackgroundTB transmission in healthcare facilities is an important public health problem, especially in the often-overcrowded settings of HIV treatment scale-up. The problem is compounded by the emergence of drug resistant TB. Natural ventilation is a low-cost environmental control measure for TB infection control where climate permits that is suited to many different areas in healthcare facilities. There are no published data on the effect of simple structural modifications to existing hospital infrastructure to improve natural ventilation and reduce the risk of nosocomial TB transmission.The purpose of this study was to measure the effect of simple architectural modifications to existing hospital waiting and consulting rooms in a low resource setting on (a) improving natural ventilation and (b) reducing modelled TB transmission risk.MethodsRoom ventilation was measured pre- and post-modification using a carbon dioxide tracer-gas technique in four waiting rooms and two consulting rooms in two hospitals in Lima, Peru. Modifications included additional windows for cross-ventilation (n=2 rooms); removing glass from unopenable windows (n=2); creation of an open skylight (n=1); re-building a waiting-room in the open air (n=1). Changes in TB transmission risk for waiting patients, or healthcare workers in consulting rooms, were estimated using mathematical modelling.ResultsAs a result of the infrastructure modifications, room ventilation in the four waiting rooms increased from mean 5.5 to 15; 11 to 16; 10 to 17; and 9 to 66 air-changes/hour respectively; and in the two consulting rooms from mean 3.6 to 17; and 2.7 to 12 air-changes/hour respectively. There was a median 72% reduction (inter-quartile range 51-82%) in calculated TB transmission risk for healthcare workers or waiting patients. The modifications cost <US$75 in four rooms, and US$1000 and US$7000 in the remaining two rooms.ConclusionsSimple modifications to existing hospital infrastructure considerably increased natural ventilation, and greatly reduced modelled TB transmission risk at little cost.

AB BackgroundSeasonal patterns of influenza A subtypes and B lineages in tropical/subtropical regions across age have remained to be explored. The impact of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic on seasonal influenza activity havenot beenwell understood.MethodsBased on a national sentinel hospital-based influenza surveillance system, the epidemiology of influenza virus during 2006/07-2015/16 was characterized in the subtropical city, Chengdu. Chengdu is one of the most populous cities in southwestern China,where the first reported case of A/H1N1pdm09 in mainland China was identified. Wavelet analysis was applied to identify the periodicities of A/H3N2, seasonal A/H1N1, A/H1N1pdm09, Victoria, and Yamagata across age, respectively. The persistence and age distribution patterns were described during the pre-pandemic (2006/07-2008/09), pandemic (2009/10), and post-pandemic (2010/11-2015/16) seasons.ResultsA total of 10,981 respiratory specimens were collected, of which 2516 influenza cases were identified. Periodicity transition from semi-annual cycles to an annual cycle was observed for composite influenza virus as well as A/H3N2 along in Chengdu since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Semi-annual cycles of composite influenza virus and A/H3N2 along were observed again during 2014/15-2015/16, coinciding with the emergence and predominance of A/H3N2 significant antigenic drift groups. However, A/H1N1pdm09, Victoria, and Yamagata generally demonstrated an annual winter-spring peak in non-pandemic seasons. Along with periodicity transitions, age groups with higher positive rates shifted from school-aged children and adults to adults and the elderly for A/H1N1pdm09 during 2009/10-2010/11 and for A/H3N2 during 2014/15-2015/16.ConclusionsDifferences in periodicity and age distribution by subtype/lineage and byseason highlight the importance of increasing year-round influenza surveillance and developing subtype/lineage- and age-specific prevention and control measures. Changes of periodicity and age shifts should be considered in public health response to influenza pandemics and epidemics. In addition, it is suggested to use quadrivalent influenza vaccines to provide protection against both influenza B lineages.

AB BackgroundThe red tape and delays around research ethics and governance approvals frequently frustrate researchers yet, as the lesser of two evils, are largely accepted as unavoidable. Here we quantify aspects of the research ethics and governance approvals for one interview- and questionnaire-based study conducted in England which used the National Health Service (NHS) procedures and the electronic Integrated Research Application System (IRAS). We demonstrate the enormous impact of existing approvals processes on costs of studies, including opportunity costs to focus on the substantive research, and suggest directions for radical system change.Main textWe have recorded 491 exchanges with 89 individuals involved in research ethics and governance approvals, generating 193 pages of email text excluding attachments. These are conservative estimates (e.g. only records of the research associate were used). The exchanges were conducted outside IRAS, expected to be the platform where all necessary documents are provided and questions addressed. Importantly, the figures exclude the actual work of preparing the ethics documentation (such as the ethics application, information sheets and consent forms). We propose six areas of work to enable system change: 1. Support the development of a broad range of customised research ethics and governance templates to complement generic, typically clinical trials orientated, ones; 2. Develop more sophisticated and flexible frameworks for study classification; 3. Link with associated processes for assessment, feedback, monitoring and reporting, such as ones involving funders and patient and public involvement groups; 4. Invest in a new generation IT infrastructure; 5. Enhance system capacity through increasing online reviewer participation and training; and 6. Encourage researchers to quantify the approvals processes for their studies.ConclusionEthics and governanceapprovals are burdensome for historical reasons and not because of the nature of the task. There are many opportunities to improve their efficiency and analytic depth in an age of innovation, increased connectivity and distributed working. If we continue to work under current systems, we are perpetuating, paradoxically, an unethical system ofresearch approvals by virtue of its wastefulness and impoverished ethical debate.

AB BackgroundCholera remains a disease of public health importance in Nigeria associated with high morbidity and mortality. In November 2014, the Nigeria Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programme (NFELTP) was notified of an increase in suspected cholera cases in Gomani, Kwali Local Government Area. NFELTP residents were deployed to investigate the outbreak with the objectives of verifying the diagnosis, identifying risk factors and instituting appropriate control measures to control the outbreak.MethodsWe conducted an unmatched case-control study. We defined a cholera case as any person aged 5years with acute watery diarrhea in Gomani community. We identified community controls. A total of 43 cases and 68 controls were recruited. Structured questionnaires were administered to both cases and controls. Four stool samples from case-patients and two water samples from the community water source were collected for laboratory investigation. We performed univariate and bivariate analysis using Epi-Info version 7.1.3.10.ResultsThe mean age of cases and controls was 20.3years and 25.4 respectively (p value 0.09). Females constituted 58.1% (cases) and 51.5%(controls). The attack rate was 4.3% with a case fatality rate of 13%. Four stool (100%) specimen tested positive for Vibrio cholerae. The water source and environment were polluted by indiscriminate defecation. Compared to controls, cases were more likely to have drank from Zamani river (OR 14.2, 95% CI: 5.5-36.8) and living in households(HH) with more than 5 persons/HH (OR 5.9, 95% CI: 1.3-27.2). Good hand hygiene was found to be protective (OR 0.3, 95% CI: 0.1-0.7).ConclusionVibrio cholerae was the cause of the outbreak in Gomani. Drinking water from Zamani river, living in overcrowded HH and poor hand hygiene were significantly associated with the outbreak. We initiated hand hygiene and water treatment to control the outbreak.

TI Evaluation of diagnostic performance of non-invasive HIV self-testing
   kit using oral fluid in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: A facility-based
   cross-sectional study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing is critical for early linkage to treatment and care services. However, there is a substantial gap in HIV testing, particularly in resource limited settings due to low accessibility of HIV testing sites, inconvenient testing hours, and concerns about loss of confidentiality. Thus, adopting new strategies such as HIV self-testing (HIVST) could overcome these barriers and increases HIV testing uptake.
   Objective
   The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of non-invasive HIVST kit using oral fluid for HIV diagnosis. This study also aimed to assess the ability of clients in interpretation of OraQuick HIVST results.
   Method
   Between December 2017 and February 2018, a total of 400 study participants were enrolled into the study to assess a diagnostic accuracy of Oral fluid-based HIVST kit ( OraQuick) in 15 public health facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Participants were provided with instructions and visual aids on how to perform HIVST and interpret results. They also underwent a blood-based rapid HIV antibody test as per the current national algorithm. The results of HIVST were interpreted independently by the participants and respective health care workers (HCWs). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), Negative predictive value (NPV) and inter-rater agreement of the test were computed.
   Results
   Out of 200 participants who tested positive on the national algorithm testing, oral fluid-based self-testing was positive in 199 (99.5%), false negative in 1 (0.5%). Of 200 participants who tested negative on the national algorithm testing, self-testing was negative in 200 (100%). There were no false positive and invalid tests. The sensitivity and specificity of the OraQuick HIVST were 99.5% (95%CI: 97.26-99.99) and 100% (95%CI: 98.18-100.0), respectively. The overall agreement between the two tests was high (kappa value = 0.995). The PPV and NPV of OraQuick test were 100% and 99.5% (95%CI: 96.59-99.93) respectively.
   Conclusion
   This study showed a high diagnostic performance of OraQuick HIV self-test and suggests that OraQuick HIVST kit has a potential to be used for HIV testing in Ethiopia along with the national algorithm.

TI Biased efficacy estimates in phase-III dengue vaccine trials due to
   heterogeneous exposure and differential detectability of primary
   infections across trial arms
SO PLOS ONE

AB Vaccine efficacy (VE) estimates are crucial for assessing the suitability of dengue vaccine candidates for public health implementation, but efficacy trials are subject to a known bias to estimate VE toward the null if heterogeneous exposure is not accounted for in the analysis of trial data. In light of many well-characterized sources of heterogeneity in dengue virus (DENV) transmission, our goal was to estimate the potential magnitude of this bias in VE estimates for a hypothetical dengue vaccine. To ensure that we realistically modeled heterogeneous exposure, we simulated city-wide DENV transmission and vaccine trial protocols using an agent-based model calibrated with entomological and epidemiological data from long-term field studies in Iquitos, Peru. By simulating a vaccine with a true VE of 0.8 in 1,000 replicate trials each designed to attain 90% power, we found that conventional methods underestimated VE by as much as 21% due to heterogeneous exposure. Accounting for the number of exposures in the vaccine and placebo arms eliminated this bias completely, and the more realistic option of including a frailty term to model exposure as a random effect reduced this bias partially. We also discovered a distinct bias in VE estimates away from the null due to lower detectability of primary DENV infections among seronegative individuals in the vaccinated group. This difference in detectability resulted from our assumption that primary infections in vaccinees who are seronegative at baseline resemble secondary infections, which experience a shorter window of detectable viremia due to a quicker immune response. This resulted in an artefactual finding that VE estimates for the seronegative group were approximately 1% greater than for the seropositive group. Simulation models of vaccine trials that account for these factors can be used to anticipate the extent of bias in field trials and to aid in their interpretation.

TI How cutaneous leishmaniasis and treatment impacts in the patients'
   lives: A cross-sectional study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID QUALITY-OF-LIFE; HEALTH-STATUS; DISEASE
AB Background
   Until now, few studies have evaluated the effect of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) on patients' quality of life, and none have used a specific instrument to measure this effect. The objective of this study was to identify factors that may be associated with the high impact of CL and to assess patients' satisfaction with treatment and health services by utilizing a disease-specific questionnaire.
   Methodology
   Between December 2015 and May 2017, 100 patients with localized cutaneous leishmaniasis were interviewed at a leishmaniasis referral center in Brazil. Data were collected by two questionnaires. One questionnaire compiled the sociodemographic, economic, and clinical information related to the disease. The second questionnaire was the Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Impact Questionnaire (CLIQ), which consisted of two subscales that measured 1) the general impact of CL and 2) patients' perceptions of treatment and health services. The median scores from each of these two subscales were used to dichotomize the dependent variables. Risk factors for the high impact of CL and for low patient satisfaction with treatment and health services were analyzed with a logistic regression analysis.
   Results
   The chance of higher impact of CL was increased in patients with the presence of comorbidities (OR: 3.9; CI 1.25-12.36), in those with absences from work (OR: 12.0; CI 3.78-42.55), in those who relied on public transportation by a municipal bus (OR: 5.8; CI 1.27-26.77), and in those who had illness-related expenses greater than U$137 (OR: 3.5; CI 1.17-10.24). The chance of patient dissatisfaction with treatment and health services increased with higher education (OR: 5.0; CI 1.19-21.03) and with illness-related expenses exceeding U$ 137 (OR: 4.64; CI 1.49-14.48). Once the sample was non-probabilistic, findings are not representative of CL patients in general.
   Conclusions
   CL and its treatment have a negative impact on patients' quality of life. Considering these effects during public health planning may help patients to confront the disease.

AB Introduction
   Active tuberculosis (TB) and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) are a public health threat in prisons around the world. The objectives of the study were to estimate the prevalence of LTBI and TB as well as to investigate TB transmission inside one prison, in Colombia.
   Methods
   A Cross-sectional study was conducted in inmates who agreed to participate. Inmates with respiratory symptoms (RS) of any duration underwent to medical evaluation and three sputum samples were taken for smear microscopy and culture for TB diagnosis. Drug susceptibility was analyzed using BACTEC MGIT 960 and GenoType MTBDRplus. Molecular genotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates was performed by 24-Locus MIRU-VNTR and spoligotyping. LTBI was evaluated according to the result of the tuberculin skin test (TST). Close contact investigation was conducted inside the prison for inmates that shared the cell with the index TB case.
   Results
   Among 301/2,020 (15%) inmates with RS of any duration, 8% were diagnosed with active TB. The prevalence of active TB was 1,026 cases/100,000 inmates. We isolated M. tuberculosis in 19/24 (79%) TB cases, 94.7% were susceptible to first line drugs and only one was monoresistant to isoniazid. The most prevalent sub-lineage was Haarlem (68.4%), followed by LAM (26.3%) and T superfamily (5.3%). 24-Locus MIRU-VNTR typing results alone or in combination with spoligotyping identified three clusters containing two isolates each. Two clusters corresponded to inmates that shared the same cell, but each one was located in different blocks of the prison. Inmates from the last cluster were in the same block in nearby cells. TST reading was performed in 95.6% inmates, and 67.6% had a positive reaction.
   Conclusions
   The prevalence of LTBI and TB was higher in prison than in the general population. Molecular genotyping suggests that TB in this prison is mainly caused by strains imported by inmates or endogenous reactivation.

DT Article

AB Community kitchens (CKs) have been recommended as public health strategies with social and nutritional health benefits for low-income participants and their families in different settings. The benefit of CKs in improving the food security status of participants in the context of conflict and displacement is less conclusive. This study aimed to qualitatively explore the impact of CKs on the food security status of community kitchen workers (CWs) and Syrian refugee (SR) families in Lebanon. An exploratory qualitative descriptive approach was adopted. Focus group discussions were conducted with 15 CWs and 49 SRs, and transcripts were analyzed thematically. Emerging themes included: motivation to join the CKs (CWs only), perception towards CKs, impact of these CKs, and their sustainability (both groups). Motivating factors for CWs included financial, internal and societal drivers, and the favorable type of work in kitchens. The perception towards CKs was overall positive among CWs and SR beneficiaries. Both groups reported the positive impact of CKs on their food security and financial status, which in turn affected positively their psychological health. At the social level, CWs indicated that the kitchen's friendly atmosphere increased social cohesion and companionship between Syrians and Lebanese within the kitchen. In addition, CWs reported increased sense of empathy towards SRs benefiting from the CK services. According to study participants, the positive impact of the CKs was almost completely reversed when their operation and services were interrupted for two months. Both CWs and SRs identified facilitators and barriers that can affect the sustainability of the kitchens, including financial and entrepreneurial skills. In conclusion, findings from this study highlight that CKs can be promising programs to improve the food security and livelihoods of participants, while also increasing social cohesion and integration of refugees within host communities in protracted crisis contexts.

TI Patients' experiences on accessing health care services for management
   of hypertension in rural Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka: A
   qualitative study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID BLOOD-PRESSURE; GLOBAL BURDEN
AB Hypertension is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease and leading cause of premature death globally. In 2008, approximately 40% of adults were diagnosed with hypertension, with more than 1.5 billion people estimated to be affected globally by 2025. Hypertension disproportionally affects low-and middle-income countries, where the prevalence is higher and where the health systems are more fragile. This qualitative study explored patients' experiences on the management and control of hypertension in rural Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. We conducted sixty semi-structured interviews, with 20 participants in each country. Hypertensive individuals were recruited based on age, gender and hypertensive status. Overall, patients' reported symptoms across the three countries were quite similar, although perceptions of hypertension were mixed. The majority of patients reported low knowledge on how to prevent or treat hypertension. The main barriers to accessing health services, as reported by participants, were inadequate services and poor quality of existing facilities, shortage of medicine supplies, busyness of doctors due to high patient load, long travel distance to facilities, and long waiting times once facilities were reached. Patients also mentioned that cost was a barrier to accessing services and adhering to medication. Many patients, when asked for areas of improvement, reported on the importance of the provider-patient relationship and mentioned valuing doctors who spent time with them, provided advice, and could be trusted. However, most patients reported that, especially at primary health care level and in government hospitals, the experience with their doctor did not meet their expectations. Patients in the three countries reported desire for good quality local medical services, the need for access to doctors, medicine and diagnostics and decreased cost for medication and medical services. Patients also described welcoming health care outreach activities near their homes. Areas of improvement could focus on reorienting community health workers' activities; involving family members in comprehensive counseling for medication adherence; providing appropriate training for health care staff to deliver effective information and services for controlling hypertension to patients; enhancing primary health care and specialist services; improving supplies of hypertensive medication in public facilities; taking into account patients' cultural and social background when providing services; and facilitating access and treatment to those who are most vulnerable.

TI Dietary and non-dietary determinants of linear growth status of infants
   and young children in Ethiopia: Hierarchical regression analysis
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID COUNTRIES
AB Introduction
   Childhood growth faltering remains a major public health problem in developing countries. We aimed to identify the distal, underlying, and proximal dietary and non-dietary factors associated with length-for-age (LFA) of infants and young children in Ethiopia.
   Methods
   We used a nationally representative sample of 2,932 children aged 6-23 months from the Ethiopian demographic and health survey (EDHS) conducted in 2016. Hierarchical regression analysis was done to identify the factors associated with LFA.
   Findings
   Pastoral residence (adjusted (a beta) = -0.56, 95% CI = -0.82, -0.31, P< 0.001) and poorest household wealth category (a beta = -0.57, 95% CI = -0.66, -0.48, P< 0.001) were the basic factors negatively associated with LFA. Among underlying factors, maternal wasting (a beta = -0.43, 95% CI = -0.58, -0.28, P< 0.001), and unimproved toilet facility (a beta = -0.48, 95% CI = -0.73, -0.23, P< 0.001) were negatively associated with LFA. Proximal factors found positively associated with LFA were dietary diversity (a beta = 0.09, 95% CI = 0.043, 0.136, P< 0.001), meal frequency (a beta = 0.04, 95% CI = 0.00, 0.08, P = 0.042), and vitamin A supplementation (a beta = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.03, 0.29, P = 0.020). Male sex (a beta = -0.26, 95% CI = -0.39, -0.14, P< 0.001), age (a beta = -0.12, 95% CI = -0.13, -0.10, P = 0.001), small birth size (a beta = -0.45, 95% CI = -0.62, -0.29, P< 0.001), and not currently breastfeeding (a beta = -0.29, 95% CI = -0.47, -0.11, P = 0.003) were negatively associated with LFA.
   Conclusion
   LFA was associated with various influences at distal, underlying, and proximal levels. A multi-pronged approach, addressing the various factors comprehensively, would represent an important consideration to promote linear growth in early childhood in Ethiopia.

AB Aim of study
   To determine the prevalence of cardiovascular disease and associated risk factors in the population of Gaza strip in Palestine.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional stratified cluster sample design was applied in this study. A sample of 2240 participant (1121 males and 1119 females) aged. 25 years participated in the study. For each individual, trained staff administered a questionnaire, where all variables of interest followed WHO's STEP wise approach to surveillance chronic disease risk factors (STEPS) (WHO, 2001). Sociodemographic data, anthropometric measure (body mass index, blood pressure), and biochemical test (blood sugar and lipids profiles) were measured. Short International Physical Activity (IPAQ) questionnaire form was used. Bivariate analysis and logistic regression were used with SPSS (version 22.0) to analyze the data.
   Results
   The most common condition was coronary artery disease (8.3%), followed by stroke events (3%). The associated risk factors were obesity (47.8%), hypertension (28.4%), current smoking account for (23.2%), diabetes mellitus (19.1%), high cholesterol level (8.8%), and high triglycerides level (40.2%). Additionally, the proportion of being physical active was found to be low (48.3%); particularly with increasing age. More than 30% of the population has less than 4 days of consumption of fruit and vegetables per week and 65.9% has less than 2 servings per day.
   Conclusion
   The burden of CVDs and their associated risk factors is considerable in Gaza and represents a major public health concern. Effective strategies in management, education and

AB Background: Alcohol and illicit drugs have been found to be major contributing factors leading to severe injuries in a variety of settings. In Tanzania, the use of these substances among injured patients has not been studied. We investigated the prevalence of positive tests for alcohol and illicit drug use among injured patients presenting to the emergency medicine department (ED) of Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH).
   Methods: This was a prospective cohort study of a consecutive sample of patients > 18 years of age presenting to the ED-MNH with injury related complaints in October and November 2015. A structured data sheet was used to record demographic information, mechanism of injury, clinical presentation, alcohol and illicit drug test results, and ED disposition. Alcohol levels and illicit drug use were tested by breathalyser device or swab stick alcohol test and multidrug urine panel, respectively. Patients were followed up for 24 h and 30 days using medical chart reviews and phone calls. Descriptive statistics and relative risk were used to describe the results.
   Results: We screened 1011 patients and we enrolled all 143 (14.1%) patients who met inclusion criteria. 123 (86.0%) were male, the median age was 30 years (IQR: 23-36 years). The most frequent mechanism of injury was road traffic accidents (84.6%). 67/143 (46.9%) patients tested positive for alcohol and 44/122 (36.1%) patients tested positive for drugs. 29 (26.1%) tested positive for alcohol and drugs. The most frequently detected illicit drug was marijuana in 30/122 (24.5%) injured patients. 23/53 (43.4%) patients with positive alcohol testing self-reported alcohol use. 3/25 patients with positive illicit drug tests who were able to provide self-reports, self-reported drug use. At 30-day followup, 43 (64.2%) injured patients who tested positive for alcohol had undergone major surgery, 6 (9.0%) had died, and 36 (53.7%) had not yet returned to their baseline.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of alcohol and illicit drugs is very high in patients presenting to the ED-MNH with injury. Further studies are needed to generalise the results in Tanzania. Public health initiatives to decrease drinking and/or illicit drug use and driving should be implemented.

AB BackgroundAlthough there are public policies for eradicating congenital syphilis, they do not seem to be a routine in most health services. The objective of this study was to evaluate the management of sexual partners of pregnant women with syphilis in primary health care in northeastern Brazil.MethodsThis is a qualitative assessment carried out from February to October 2014 in the city of Fortaleza, Ceara, northeastern region of Brazil, through the observation of six primary health care centers and interviews with 21 professionals, six coordinators, nine women diagnosed with syphilis during antenatal care and four sexual partners. The data were submitted to thematic content analysis.ResultsImportant flaws were identified at the primary health centers studied regarding the management of syphilis during pregnancy. Accessing testing and treatment is difficult, and there are no standardized strategies to notify the partner. The responsibility for notifying them is transferred to the women, and counseling does not offer proper guidance nor sufficient emotional support to help them.ConclusionThe management of pregnant women and their sexual partners in our region does not comply with global recommendations. Professional qualification, sensitization, and standardization of health professionals' conduct are necessary. Offering support to health professionals on their clinical practices by means of a supervision process may contribute to the adoption of the recommended guidelines and to the promotion of care based on privacy, respect, confidentiality of information, and awareness of the problems faced by women as a result of syphilis diagnosis.

AB BackgroundThe West Africa Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in 2014-2016 was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) a public health emergency of international concern. Most of the previous studies done in Sierra Leone relating to the clinical and epidemiological features of EVD during the 2014-2016 West African outbreak focused on adult EVD patients. There have been conflicting reports about the effects of EVD on children during previous outbreaks.MethodsThis is an observational retrospective analysis of medical data of all laboratory confirmed paediatric EVD patients below 15years of age who were admitted at the 34 Military Hospital Ebola Treatment Center (ETC) in Wilberforce, Sierra Leone between June 2014 to April 2015. We analyzed the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of paediatric EVD cases contained in case report forms that were collected by Ebola surveillance officers and clinicians at the 34 Military Hospital ETC. Both univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of paediatric EVD patients that were associated with EVD facility-based mortality.ResultsThe majority of the paediatric EVD cases in this study were female (56.1%), pupils (51.1%), and 43.2% belonged to the age group between 10years and below 15years. The median age of the paediatric EVD cases was 9years (interquartile range=4 to 11years). Adjusting for other covariates in the model, male paediatric EVD patient (AOR=13.4, 95% CI=[2.07-156-18], p<0.05), EVD patient with abdominal pain (AOR=11.0, 95% CI=[1.30-161.81], p<0.05), vomiting (AOR=35.7, 95% CI=[3.43-833.73], p<0.05), signs of conjunctivitis (AOR=17.4, 95% CI=[1.53-342.21], p<0.05) and difficulty in breathing (AOR=23.3, 95% CI=[1.92-713.01], p<0.05) at the time of admission had increased odds of dying during EVD treatment.ConclusionsWe recommend the adoption of case definitions currently in vigour to cater for specific characteristics of paediatric patients. Subgroups that can be identified by applying the model developed in this study may require special attention and intensified care.

AB BackgroundMortality indicators are essential for monitoring population health. Although Malaysia has a functional death registration system, the quality of information on causes of death still needs improvement, since approximately 30% of deaths are classified to poorly defined causes. This study was conducted to verify registered causes in a sample of deaths in 2013 and utilise the findings to estimate cause-specific mortality indicators for Malaysia in 2013.MethodsThis is a cross-sectional study involving a nationally representative sample of 14,497 deaths distributed across 19 districts. Registered causes of deaths were verified using standard medical record review protocols for hospital deaths, and locally adapted international standard verbal autopsy procedures for deaths outside hospitals. The findings were used to measure the validity and reliability of the registration data, as well as to establish plausible cause-specific mortality fractions for hospital and non-hospital deaths, which were subsequently used as the basis for estimating national cause-specific mortality indicators.ResultsThe overall response rate for the study was 67%. Verified causes of 5041 hospital deaths and 3724 deaths outside hospitals were used to derive national mortality estimates for 2013 by age, sex and cause. The study was able to reclassify most of the ill-defined deaths to a specific cause. The leading causes of deaths for males were Ischaemic Heart Disease (15.4%), Cerebrovascular diseases (13.7%), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (8.5%) and Road Traffic Accident (8.0%). Among females, the leading causes were Cerebrovascular diseases (18.3%), Ischaemic Heart Disease (12.7%), Lower Respiratory Infections (11.5%) and Diabetes Mellitus (7.2%).ConclusionsInvestigation of registered causes of death using verbal autopsy and medical record review yielded adequate information to enable estimation of cause-specific mortality indicators in Malaysia. Strengthening the national mortality statistics system must be made a priority as it is a core data source for policy and evaluation of the public health and healthcare sectors in Malaysia.

ID PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM INFECTION; RISK-FACTORS; PREGNANT-WOMEN;
   TRANSMISSION AREA; CHILDHOOD MALARIA; SCHOOL-CHILDREN; PERIURBAN AREA;
   YOUNG-CHILDREN; PREVALENCE; ANEMIA
AB Background
   A clear understanding of the effects of housing structure, education, occupation, income, and wealth on malaria can help to better design socioeconomic interventions to control the disease. This literature review summarizes the relationship of housing structure, educational level, occupation, income, and wealth with the epidemiology of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
   Methods
   A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines. The protocol for this study is registered in PROSPERO (ID=CRD42017056070), an international database of prospectively registered systematic reviews. On January 16, 2016, available literature was searched in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library. All but case studies, which reported prevalence or incidence of Plasmodium infection stratified by socioeconomic status among individuals living in SSA, were included without any limits. Odds Ratio (OR) and Relative Risk (RR), together with 95% CI and p-values were used as effect measures. Heterogeneity was assessed using chi-square, Moran's I-2, and tau(2) tests. Fixed (I-2<30%), random (I-2 >= 30%) or log-linear dose-response model was used to estimate the summary OR or RR.
   Results
   After removing duplicates and screening of titles, abstracts, and full text, 84 articles were found eligible for systematic review, and 75 of them were included in the meta-analyses. Fifty-seven studies were cross-sectional, 12 were prospective cohort, 10 were case-control, and five were randomized control trials. The odds of Plasmodium infection increased among individuals who were living in poor quality houses (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.56-3.23, I-2 = 27.7), were uneducated (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.19-1.54, I-2 = 72.4.0%), and were farmers by occupation (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.11-1.85, I-2 = 0.0%) [p<0.01 for all]. The odds of Plasmodium infection also increased with a decrease in the income (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03, tau(2)<0.001), and wealth index of individuals (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.18-1.35, tau(2) = 0.028) [p<0.001 for both]. Longitudinal studies also showed an increased risk of Plasmodium infection among individuals who were living in poor quality houses (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.47-2.25, I-2 = 0.0%), were uneducated (OR 1.27, 1.03-1.50, I-2 = 0.0%), and were farmers (OR 1.36, 1.18-1.58) [p<0.01 for all].
   Conclusions
   Lack of education, low income, low wealth, living in poorly constructed houses, and having an occupation in farming may increase risk of Plasmodium infection among people in SSA. Public policy measures that can reduce inequity in health coverage, as well as improve economic and educational opportunities for the poor, will help in reducing the burden of malaria in SSA.

AB Background
   Ukraine has the second largest European HIV epidemic. This study aimed to describe stigma, demographic and social factors and their association with anxiety among perinatally and behaviourally-HIV-infected (PHIV; BHIV) young people in Kiev and Odessa.
   Methods
   104 PHIV and 100 BHIV young people aged 13-25 years completed a confidential tablet-based survey. Survey tools included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (anxiety sub-scale scores of 8-10 indicating mild and >= 11 moderate/severe symptoms in last 7 days), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) and HIV Stigma Scale (HSS) (short version, composite of disclosure, negative self-image and public attitudes sub-scales). Unadjusted Poisson regression models were fitted to explore factors associated with moderate/severe anxiety symptoms.
   Results
   PHIV and BHIV young people were of median age 15.5 [IQR 13.9-17.1] and 23.0 [21.0-24.3] years, having registered for HIV care a median 12.3 [10.3-14.4] and 0.9 [0.2-2.4] years previously; 97% (97/100) and 66% (65/99) respectively were on ART. Overall 43% (95% CI 36-50%) reported any and 13% (95% CI 9-19%) moderate/severe anxiety symptoms, with no difference by HIV acquisition mode (p = 0.405) or gender (p = 0.700). 42% (75/180) reported history of an emotional health problem for which they had not been referred/attended for care. Moderate/severe anxiety symptoms were associated with HIV-related stigma (prevalence ratio (PR) 1.24 95% CI 1.14-1.34 per HSS unit increase), lower self-esteem (PR 0.83 95% CI 0.78-0.90 per RSES point increase), CD4 <= 350 cells/mm(3) (PR 2.29 95% CI 1.06-4.97), having no-one at home who knew the respondent's HIV status (PR 9.15 95% CI 3.40-24.66 vs all know) and, among BHIV, less stable living situation (PR 6.83 95% CI 1.99-23.48 for >= 2 vs no home moves in last 3 years) and history of drug use (PR 4.65 95% CI 1.83-11.85).
   Conclusions
   Results indicated unmet need for psychosocial support. Further work is needed to explore strategies for mental health support, particularly around disclosure, self-esteem and stigma.

AB Nurses who experience workplace violence exhibit compromised care quality and decreased work morale, which may increase their turnover rate. This study explored prevalence of workplace violence, the reaction of victims, and workplace strategies adopted to prevent violence among acute psychiatric settings in northern Taiwan. A cross-sectional study was conducted, which consisted of 429 nurses who completed the Chinese version of the Workplace Violence Survey Questionnaire developed by the International Labor Office, International Council of Nurses, World Health Organization, and Public Services International. The rates of physical and psychological violence were 55.7% and 82.1%, respectively. Most perpetrator of the workplace violence were patients. Most victims responded by instructing the perpetrator to stop, followed by narrating the incident to friends, family, and colleagues. Only 4.9%-12% of the victims completed an incident or accident form, and the main reason for not reporting these violent incidents was the belief that reporting such incidents was useless or unimportant. The major strategies adopted by workplaces to prevent violence were security measures, patient protocols, and training. Institutions should train staff to handle violence, provide a therapeutic environment, simplify the reporting process, and encourage reporting of all types of violence.

ID MESSENGER-RNA; REAL-TIME
AB BackgroundWith sequencing technologies becoming cheaper and easier to use, more groups are able to obtain whole genome sequences of viruses of public health and scientific importance. Submission of genomic data to NCBI GenBank is a requirement prior to publication and plays a critical role in making scientific data publicly available. GenBank currently has automatic prokaryotic and eukaryotic genome annotation pipelines but has no viral annotation pipeline beyond influenza virus. Annotation and submission of viral genome sequence is a non-trivial task, especially for groups that do not routinely interact with GenBank for data submissions.ResultsWe present Viral Annotation Pipeline and iDentification (VAPiD), a portable and lightweight command-line tool for annotation and GenBank deposition of viral genomes. VAPiD supports annotation of nearly all unsegmented viral genomes. The pipeline has been validated on human immunodeficiency virus, human parainfluenza virus 1-4, human metapneumovirus, human coronaviruses (229E/OC43/NL63/HKU1/SARS/MERS), human enteroviruses/rhinoviruses, measles virus, mumps virus, Hepatitis A-E Virus, Chikungunya virus, dengue virus, and West Nile virus, as well the human polyomaviruses BK/JC/MCV, human adenoviruses, and human papillomaviruses. The program can handle individual or batch submissions of different viruses to GenBank and correctly annotates multiple viruses, including those that contain ribosomal slippage or RNA editing without prior knowledge of the virus to be annotated. VAPiD is programmed in Python and is compatible with Windows, Linux, and Mac OS systems.ConclusionsWe have created a portable, lightweight, user-friendly, internet-enabled, open-source, command-line genome annotation and submission package to facilitate virus genome submissions to NCBI GenBank. Instructions for downloading and installing VAPiD can be found at https://github.com/rcs333/VAPiD.

AB BackgroundCommunity based providers are well place to deliver behavioural interventions to improve health. Good project management and reliable outcome data are needed to efficiently deliver and evaluate such interventions, and Management information systems (MIS) can facilitate these processes. We explored stakeholders perspectives on the use of MIS in community based behavioural interventions.MethodsStakeholders, purposively selected to provide a range of MIS experience in the delivery of community based behavioural interventions to improve health (public health commissioners, intervention service managers, project officers, health researchers and MIS designers), were invited to participate in individual semi-structured interviews. We used a topic guide and encouraged stakeholders to reflect on their experiences.: Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed using five steps of Framework analysis. We applied an agreed coding framework and completed the interviews when no new themes emerged.ResultsWe interviewed 15 stakeholders. Key themes identified were: (i) MIS access; (ii) data and its function; (iii) MIS development and updating. Within these themes the different experiences, needs, use, training and expertise of stakeholders and the variation and potential of MIS were evidenced. Interviews advised the need to involve stakeholders in MIS design and development, build-in flexibility to accommodate MIS refinement and build on effective MIS.ConclusionsFindings advised involving stakeholders, early in the design process. Designs should build on existing MIS of proven utility and ensure flexibility in the design, to incorporate adaptations and ongoing system development in response to early MIS use and evolving stakeholder needs.

TI Effect of calories-only vs physical activity calorie expenditure
   labeling on lunch calories purchased in worksite cafeterias
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Calorie labeling; Physical activity; Obesity prevention policy
ID IMPACT; OVERWEIGHT
AB BackgroundCalorie labeling on restaurant menus is a public health strategy to guide consumer ordering behaviors, but effects on calories purchased have been minimal. Displaying labels communicating the physical activity required to burn calories may be a more effective approach, but real-world comparisons are needed.MethodsIn a quasi-experimental study, we examined the effect of physical activity calorie expenditure (PACE) food labels compared to calorie-only labels on point-of-decision food purchasing in three worksite cafeterias in North Carolina. After a year of quarterly baseline data collection, one cafeteria prominently displayed PACE labels, and two cafeterias prominently displayed calorie-only labels. Calories from foods purchased in the cafeteria during lunch were assessed over 2 weeks every 3 months for 2years by photographs of meals. We compared differences in purchased calorie estimates before and after the labeling intervention was introduced using longitudinal generalized linear mixed model regressions that included a random intercept for each participant.ResultsIn unadjusted models comparing average meal calories after vs before labeling, participants exposed to PACE labels purchased 40.4 fewer calories (P=0.002), and participants exposed to calorie-only labels purchased 38.2 fewer calories (P=0.0002). The small difference of 2 fewer calories purchased among participants exposed to PACE labeling vs calorie-only labeling was not significant (P=0.90). Models adjusting for age, sex, race, occupation, numeracy level, and health literacy level did not change estimates appreciably.ConclusionIn this workplace cafeteria setting, PACE labeling was no more effective than calorie-only labeling in reducing lunchtime calories purchased.

TI Self-medication for migraine: A nationwide cross-sectional study in

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID HEADACHE; CARE; DISORDERS; EUROPE; COST
AB Headache disorders are considered the second leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide, and 90% of people have a headache episode at least once a year, thus representing a relevant public health priority. As the pharmacist is often the first and only point of reference for people complaining of headache, we carried out a survey in a nationwide sample of Italian pharmacies, in order to describe the distribution of migraine or non-migraine type headaches and medicines overuse among people entering pharmacies seeking for self-medication; and to evaluate the association, in particular of migraine, with socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, and with the pathway of care followed by the patients. A 14-item questionnaire, including socio-demographic and clinical factors, was administered by trained pharmacists to subjects who entered a pharmacy requesting self-medication for a headache attack. The ID Migraine TM Screener was used to classify headache sufferers in four classes. From June 2016 to January 2017, 4424 people have been interviewed. The prevalence of definite migraines was 40%, significantly higher among women and less educated people. About half of all headache sufferers and a third of migraineurs do not consider their condition as a disease and are not cared by any doctor. Among people seeking self medication in pharmacies for acute headache attacks, the rate of definite or probable migraine is high, and a large percentage of them is not correctly diagnosed and treated. The pharmacy can be a valuable observatory for the study of headaches, and the first important step to improve the quality of care delivered to these patients.

ID HAPPINESS; CONTEXT
AB This paper presents a new public-use dataset for community-level life satisfaction in Canada, based on more than 500,000 observations from the Canadian Community Health Surveys and the General Social Surveys. The country is divided into 1216 similarly sampled geographic regions, using natural, built, and administrative boundaries. A cross-validation exercise suggests that our choice of minimum sampling thresholds approximately maximizes the predictive power of our estimates. The resulting dataset reveals robust differences in life satisfaction between and across urban and rural communities. We compare aggregated life satisfaction data with a range of key census variables to illustrate some of the ways in which lives differ in the most and least happy communities.

TI Socio-economic status and behavioural and cardiovascular risk factors in
   Papua New Guinea: A cross-sectional survey
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID DISEASE; GLOBALIZATION; STROKE; HEALTH
AB Background
   Risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) are negatively correlated with socio-economic status (SES) in high-income countries (HIC) but there has been little research on their distribution by household SES within low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Considering the limited data from LMICs, this paper examines the association between behavioural and cardiovascular risk factors and household SES in Papua New Guinea (PNG).
   Methods
   Reported here are results of 671 participants from the 900 randomly selected adults aged 15-65 years. These adults were recruited from three socioeconomically and geographically diverse surveillance sites (peri-urban community, rural Highland and an Island community) in PNG in 2013-2014. We measured their CVD risk factors (behavioural and metabolic) using a modified WHO STEPS risk factor survey and analysis of blood samples. We assessed SES by education, occupation and creating a household wealth index based on household assets. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a generalized linear model to assess the associations between risks and SES.
   Findings
   Elevated CVD risk factors were common in all SES groups but the CVD metabolic risk factors were most prevalent among homemakers, peri-urban and rural highlands, and the highest (4th and 5th) wealth quintile population. Adults in the highest wealth quintile had high risks of obesity, elevated HbA1c and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that were greater than those in the lowest quintile although those in the highest wealth quintiles were less likely to smoke tobacco. Compared to people from the Island community, peri-urban residents had increased risks of increased waist circumference (WC) (RR: 1.67, 95%Cl: 1.21-2.31), hypertension (RR: 2.29, 95%Cl: 1.89-4.56), high cholesterol (RR: 2.22, 95%Cl: 1.20-4-10), high triglycerides (RR: 1.49, 95%Cl: 1.17-1-91), elevated HbA1c (RR: 5.54, 95`)/X1: 1.3621-56), and Metabolic syndrome (MetS) (RR: 2.04, 95%Cl: 1.25-3.32). Similarly, Rural Highland residents had increased risk of obesity (Waist Circumference RR: 1.70, 95%Cl: 1.21-3-38, Waist-Hip-Ratio RR:1.48, 95%Cl: 1.28-1-70), hypertension (RR: 2.60, 95`)/X1: 1.71-3-95), high triglycerides (RR: 1.34, 95%Cl: 1.06-1-70) and MetS (RR: 1.88, 95%Cl: 1.12-3-16) compared to those in the rural Island site.
   Interpretation
   CVD risk factors are common in PNG adults but their association with SES varies markedly and by location. Our findings show that all community members are at risk of CVD weather they are part of high or low SES groups. These results support the notion that the association between CVD risk factors and SES differ greatly accordingly to the type of SES measure used, risk factors and the population studied. In addition, our findings contribute further to the limited literature in LMIC. Longitudinal studies are needed to monitor changes in rapidly changing societies such as PNG to inform public health policy for control and prevention of NCDs in the country.

AB BackgroundImproving detection of elevated blood pressure (BP) remains a public health need. We present results from a Pop-Up health check stationed in shopping centres in England. We hypothesise the rate of case detection is related to measurable unhealthiness' of the shopping centres.MethodsA Pop-Up health check was sited in four and three shopping centres sampled from the top ten unhealthiest and top 15 healthiest shopping regions respectively, following a report ranking towns/cities based on their unhealthy and healthy retail outlets. On one day in each shopping centre, people were approached and consented to BP testing. Outcome measure was people flagged with BP140/90mmHg (cases).ResultsWe detected 45 (22.6%) and 20 (13.1%) cases from testing 199 and 152 adults in the unhealthy and healthy locations respectively (relative risk 1.72; 95% confidence interval: 1.06 to 2.78). A measure of unhealthy retail outlets (e.g. fast-food outlets) within each shopping centre was associated with detection rate (R-2=0.61; p=0.04).ConclusionAn association exists between cases of suspect hypertension found in a health check Pop-Up and measured unhealthiness' of the shopping centre site. Results hint at strategies for public testing of BP, potentially in the context of reducing health inequalities.

DT Article
DE Renal failure; Emergency complications; Dialysis; Emergency department
ID ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY; MORTALITY; DIALYSIS
AB Background: Renal failure carries high mortality even in high-resource countries. Little attention has been paid to renal failure patients presenting acutely in emergency care settings in low-to-middle income countries (LMIC). Our aim was to describe the profile, management strategies and outcome of renal failure patients presenting with indications for emergent dialysis to an urban Emergency Department (ED) in a tertiary public hospital in Tanzania.
   Methods: This was a prospective cohort study of consecutive patients (age >= 15 yrs) presenting to the Emergency Medicine Department of Muhimbili National Hospital from September 2017 to February 2018. All patients with renal failure and complications requiring acute dialysis were included. A structured data collection sheet was used to gather demographics, clinical presentation, management strategies and outcomes. Data were summarized with descriptive statistics. Logistic regressions were performed to determine factors associated with receiving dialysis and with mortality.
   Results: We enrolled 146 patients, median age was 49 years (IQR 32-66 years), and 110 (75.3%) were male. Shortness of breath 67 (45.9%) and reduced urine output 58 (39.7%) were the most common presenting complaints. The most common complications were hyperkalemia 77 (53%), uremic encephalopathy 66 (45%) and pulmonary edema 54 (37%). All patients were hospitalized, and 61 (42%) received dialysis. Overall mortality was 39% (57 patients); the mortality in non-dialysed patients was 53% vs. 20% (p < 0.0005) in those receiving dialysis. 54% of patients with health insurance were dialyzed, compared to 39% who paid out of pocket (adjusted OR = 0.3, 95% CI: 0.1-0.9). Patients (>= 55 years) were less likely to be dialysed (adjusted OR = 0.2 [0.1-0.9]). Independent predictors of mortality were vomiting (OR = 6.2, 95% CI: 1.8-22.2), oliguria (OR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.2-9.5), pulmonary edema (OR = 4.6, 95% CI: 1.6-14.3), creatinine level > 1200umol/L (OR = 5.0 95% CI: 1.4-18.2), and not receiving dialysis (OR = 8.0, CI: 2. 7-23.5). Female sex had a lower risk of dying (OR = 0.13, CI: 0.03-0.5).
   Conclusions: In this ED in LIC, acute complications of renal failure created a need for ED stabilization and emergent dialysis. Overall in-hospital mortality was high; significantly higher in undialysed patients. Future studies in LICs should focus on identification of categories of patients that will do well with conservative therapy.

AB BackgroundThis study analyzed the reasons why physicians migrated from the Program to Value Primary Healthcare Professionals (PROVAB) to the Mais Medicos (More doctors) Program in 2015, opting to become physicians of the Primary Health Care.MethodsThe focal group techniques were used consisting of six doctors that made the option to remain in the PHC, being the results analyzed through content monitoring as well as the respective categories, which were identified as theme analysis.ResultsIt was evidenced that the physician's retention on primary care has a strong relationship with the acquisition of knowledge that is consistent with the context and the health needs of the population. Thus, appropriate competencies for the management of the different biopsychosocial characteristics of the territories, in consonance with abilities that use the communication centered on the patient as well as on the interdisciplinarity, producing health projects that include the uniqueness of the people, essential factor for the daily confrontation of the work of these physicians, strengthened by the training component of the program. Personal factors related to the empathetic profile with this level of care and the possibility of continuous improvement, besides the factors related to the adequate infrastructure and organizational climate with guaranteed salary in keeping with the complexity of Primary Care, positively influenced the permanence of these professionals and were drivers of changes in healthcare and management in the health units they were related to. The bond created with the team and patients was a great satisfaction factor for the professional, being identified by them as a possibility to make a difference in the treatment process of patients, strengthening the promotion of a healthier life through health education.ConclusionsPROVAB had an unparalleled contribution to the qualification of care in Primary Health Care, contributing to the birth of a new logic of medical training in Brazil. Its effective cooperation with the consolidation of the Mais Medicos Program, still in progress, is a great movement of resistance to the disarticulation and deconstruction of Unified Health System (SUS) which is in charge of public health in Brazil.

SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH

ID HEALTH-CARE; PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY; INTERPRETERS; BARRIERS; PHYSICIANS;
   COMPETENCE
AB BackgroundMany patients who present to public Emergency Departments (EDs) have Limited English Proficiency (LEP). LEP patients have worse understanding of their conditions and high rates of ED recidivism. LEP patients are entitled to language assistance under Title IV of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The objective of this study is to characterize the unmet need for language assistance in a public ED.MethodsRetrospective chart review of 48h of successive patient encounters in a public ED. Registration workers asked each patient their preferred language and whether they would like an interpreter. On recent implementation of a new electronic health record (EHR), however, providers were unable to see the responses recorded. When discovered, this created a natural experiment to compare patient request for language assistance with documented practice of the providers who were unaware of the patient's stated preference at registration. The study was set in a public, urban ED, annual census of 50,000 visits, with language assistance services available 24/7 via video units and phone line. The subjects included all patients presenting to the ED for a 48-h period. Those with altered level of consciousness and those who left before being seen were excluded. Age, race, ethnicity, preferred language, preference for language assistance, status of the provider as certified bilingual, documentation of language assistance use, type of language assistance used (video, phone, bilingual staff or ad hoc) were captured. Descriptive statistics were used with proportions and 95% CIs to describe the unmet need.ResultsIn total, 253 encounters met inclusion criteria. Mean age was 41years, 201/253 (79.5%) were Hispanic or Latino, and 134/253 (53%) preferred to use a language other than English (97% Spanish, 2% Armenian and 0.8% Tagalog). Of the 110/253 (43%) patients requesting an interpreter, 12/110 (10.9%) were seen by a certified bilingual provider and 5/110 (4.6%) had written documentation by the primary provider that language assistance was used. The calculated unmet need for spoken language assistance was 93/110 (84.5%) of patients requesting language assistance or 93/253 (36.8, 95%CI 31-42.9%) of total ED patients.ConclusionsIn this public ED, there is a large unmet need for language assistance for LEP patients.

AB BackgroundThe role of medicine in society appears to be focused on two views, which may be summarized as follows: Doing more means doing better (paradigm A) and Doing more does not mean doing better (paradigm B).Main bodyI compared paradigms A and B both in terms of a single clinical condition and in the general context of a medical system. For a single clinical condition, I analyzed breast cancer screening. There are at least seven interconnected issues that influence the conflict between paradigms A and B in the debate on breast cancer screening: disconnection between research and practice; scarcity of information given to women; how political correctness can influence the choice of a health policy; professional interests; doubts about effectiveness; incommensurability between harms and benefits; and the difficulty in making dichotomous decisions with discrete variables. As a general approach to medicine, the main representative of paradigm A is systems medicine. As representatives of paradigm B, I identified the following approaches or movements: choosing wisely; watchful waiting; the Too Much Medicine campaign; slow medicine; complaints against overdiagnosis; and quaternary prevention. I showed that both as a single condition and as a general approach to medicine, the comparison was entirely reducible to a harm-benefit analysis; moreover, in both cases, the two paradigms are in many respects incommensurable. This transfers the debate to the ethical level; consequently, scientists and the public have equal rights and competence to debate on this subject. Moreover, systems medicine has many ethical problems that could limit its spread.ConclusionI made some hypotheses about scenarios for the future of medicine. I particularly focused on whether systems medicine would become increasingly accessible and widespread in the population or whether it would be downsized because its promises have not been maintained or ethical problems will become unsustainable.

AB BackgroundDriver license departments in many US states collect data on individuals' height and weight. These data can be useful to researchers in epidemiological and public health studies. As height and weight on driver license are self-reported, they may be prone to reporting bias. We compare height and weight obtained from driver license records and clinically measured height and weight, as well as body mass index (BMI) values calculated using the two data sources for the same individual.MethodsWe linked individual height and weight records obtained from the Driver License Division (DLD) in the Utah Department of Public Safety to clinical records from one of the largest healthcare providers in the state of Utah. We then calculated average differences between height, weight and BMI values separately for women and men in the sample, as well as discrepancies between the two sets of measures by age and BMI category. We examined how well self-reported height and weight from the driver licenses classify individuals into specific BMI categories based on clinical measures. Finally, we used two sets of BMI values to estimate individuals' relative risk of type II diabetes.ResultsIndividuals, on average, tend to overestimate their height and underestimate their weight. Consequently, the value of BMI calculated using driver license records is lower than BMI calculated using clinical measurements. The discrepancy varies by age and by BMI category. Despite the discrepancy, BMI based on self-reported height and weight allows for accurate categorization of individuals at the higher end of the BMI scale, such as the obese. When used as predictors of relative risk of type II diabetes, both sets of BMI values yield similar risk estimates.ConclusionsData on height and weight from driver license data can be a useful asset for monitoring population health in states where such information is collected, despite the degree of misreporting associated with self-report.

TI Service-users' perspectives of link worker social prescribing: a
   qualitative follow-up study
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH; PEOPLE
AB BackgroundSocial prescribing enables health-care professionals to address non-medical causes of ill-health by harnessing the resources of the voluntary and community sectors in patient care. Although increasingly popular in the UK, evidence for the effectiveness of social prescribing is inconclusive and longer-term studies are needed. This study aimed to explore experiences of social prescribing among people with long-term conditions one to two years after their initial engagement with a social prescribing service.MethodsQualitative methods comprising semi-structured follow-up interviews were conducted with 24 users of a link worker social prescribing service who had participated in an earlier study. Participants were aged between 40 and 74years and were living in a socioeconomically-deprived area of North East England.ResultsParticipants reported reduced social isolation and improvements in their condition management and health-related behaviours. However, many participants had experienced setbacks, requiring continued support to overcome problems due to multi-morbidity, family circumstances and social, economic or cultural factors. Findings indicated that, in this sample of people facing complex health and socioeconomic issues, longer-term intervention and support was required. Features of the link worker social prescribing intervention that were positively appraised by participants, included a highly personalised service to reflect individual goal setting priorities and a focus on gradual and holistic change dealing with issues beyond health. The important role of a strong and supportive relationship with an easily-accessible link worker in promoting sustained behaviour change highlights the importance of link worker continuity. A lack of suitable and accessible voluntary and community services for onward referral acted as a barrier to involvement for some participants.ConclusionsThis study highlights issues of interest to commissioners and providers of social prescribing. Engagement with social prescribing for up to two years was examined and continued involvement was identified for those with complex issues, suggesting that a long-term intervention is required. The availability of onward referral services is an important consideration for social prescribing in a time of constrained public spending. From a research perspective, the range of improvements and their episodic nature suggest that the evaluation of social prescribing interventions requires both quantitative and qualitative data collected longitudinally.

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article

   ILLNESS; PEOPLE; ASSOCIATION; KNOWLEDGE
AB Background
   Mental health stigma persists despite coordinated and widely-evaluated interventions. Socioeconomic, structural, and regional context may be important in shaping attitudes to mental illness, and response to stigma interventions. Regional differences in attitudes towards mental illness could be relevant for intervention, but have not been systematically explored. We evaluated regional variation in mental health stigma using nationally representative data from England, the Health Survey for England (HSE), from 2014.
   Methods
   A previously derived scale for mental health-related attitudes with 2 factors (i. tolerance and support, ii. prejudice and exclusion), and overall attitudes, were outcomes. Weighted linear regressions estimated contribution of individual characteristics and region of residence to inter-individual variability in mental health-related attitudes.
   Results
   London and southern regions tended to have more negative mental health-related attitudes. These differences were not fully or consistently explained by individual sociodemographic characteristics, or personal familiarity with mental illness.
   Conclusions
   Stigma policies could require refinements based on geographic setting. Regions may be in particular need of stigma interventions, or be more resistant to them. Regional differences might be related to media coverage of mental illness, funding differences, service availability, or accessibility of educational opportunities. Greater geographic detail is necessary to examine reasons for regional variation in stigmatizing attitudes towards people with mental illness, for example through multilevel analysis.

TI A public health approach to mobilizing community partners for injury
   prevention: A scoping review
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Review
ID COALITIONS
AB Objectives
   Reducing injuries in adults requires work with diverse stakeholders across many sectors and at multiple levels. At the local level, public health professionals need to effectively bring together, facilitate, and support community partners to initiate evidence-based efforts. However, there has been no formal review of the literature to inform how these professionals can best create action among community partners to address injuries in adults. Thus, this scoping review aims to identify theories, models or frameworks that are applicable to a community-based approach to injury prevention.
   Methods
   Searches of scientific and less formal literature identified 13,756 relevant items published in the English language between 2000 and 2016 in North America, Europe and Australia. After screening and review, 10 publications were included that (1) identified a theory, framework or model related to mobilizing partners; and (2) referred to community-based adult injury prevention.
   Results
   Findings show that use of theories, frameworks and models in community-based injury prevention programs is rare and often undocumented. One theory and various conceptual models and frameworks exist for mobilizing partners to jointly prevent injuries; however, there are few evaluations of the processes to create community action.
   Conclusions
   Successful community-based injury prevention must build on what is already understood about creating partnership action. Evaluating local public health professional injury prevention practice based on available theories, models and frameworks will identify successes and challenges to inform process improvements. We propose a logic model to more specifically guide and evaluate how public health can work locally with community partners.

TI Anaemia among adolescent girls in three districts in Ethiopia
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Anaemia; Adolescent girls; Ethiopia; Iron folic acid; Food insecurity
ID IRON-DEFICIENCY
AB Background: Adolescence is characterized by rapid growth and development with a significantly increased need for macro and micronutrients. However, there is little empirical evidence on the burden of anaemia among adolescent girls in developing countries such as Ethiopia. This study aims to address this gap by evaluating the magnitude of anaemia with an aim to guide design of intervention modalities to address anaemia among adolescent girls.
   Methods: The study employed a community based cross sectional design. The study was conducted on weekends to capture both in school and out of school adolescent girls. Data was collected from a total 1323 adolescent girls. From each district, we randomly selected villages and ensured that the sampled households had a range geographical spread (lowlands, highlands) within the larger category of rural and urban. We performed anaemia testing using HemoCue B-Haemoglobin analyser. We applied a complex survey data analysis method to estimate the level of anaemia. The hemoglobin level was adjusted for altitude and smoking status. We ran a logistic regression model to evaluate predictors of anaemia.
   Results: The overall anaemia prevalence ranged from 24 to 38%, with an average rate of 29%. Less than half of the girls heard the term anaemia, and about one third knew the relationship between anaemia and the intake of iron rich foods. The risk of anaemia is higher among adolescent girls in their early adolescence period (10-14 years) (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR); 1.98; 95% CI; 1.03, 3.82] and among adolescent girls who lived in moderately food insecure households (AOR 1.48; 95% CI; 1.05-2.09). However, knowing the term "anaemia" was found to be protective against the risk of anaemia.
   Conclusions: The risk of anaemia was particularly high among adolescent girls in their early age and among those living in food insecure households. The prevalence of anaemia among adolescent girls is a moderate public health problem. According to the WHO set criteria, the districts could be candidates for intermittent iron and Folic acid supplementation program.

AB Background: Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) represent an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children, remaining a major public health concern, especially affecting children under 5 years old from low-income countries. Unfortunately, information regarding their epidemiology is still limited in Peru.
   Methods: A secondary data analysis was performed from a previous cross-sectional study conducted in children with a probable diagnosis of Pertussis from January 2010 to July 2012. All samples were analyzed via Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for the following etiologies: Influenza-A, Influenza-B, RSV-A, RSV-B, Adenovirus, Parainfluenza 1 virus, Parainfluenza 2 virus, Parainfluenza 3 virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae.
   Results: A total of 288 patients were included. The most common pathogen isolated was Adenovirus (49%), followed by Bordetella pertussis (41%) from our previous investigation, the most prevelant microorganisms were Mycoplasma pneumonia (26%) and Influenza-B (19.8%). Coinfections were reported in 58% of samples and the most common association was found between B. pertussis and Adenovirus (12.2%).
   Conclusions: There was a high prevalence of Adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and other etiologies in patients with a probable diagnosis of pertussis. Despite the presence of persistent cough lasting at least two weeks and other clinical characteristics highly suspicious of pertussis, secondary etiologies should be considered in children under 5 years-old in order to give a proper treatment.

AB Background: Hypertension self-care practice is essential for blood pressure control and reduction of hypertension complications. Nevertheless, we know little concerning hypertension self-care practice in Ethiopia. The purpose of this study was to assess hypertension self-care practice and associated factors among patients in public health facilities in Dessie town, Ethiopia.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 309 hypertensive patients (mean age 58.8 years, 53.4% women) completed the interviewer-administered questionnaire in Amharic language. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were conducted using SPSS version 22.
   Result: The mean score for hypertension self-care was 37.7 +/- 8.2 and 51% scored below the mean. Divorced participants (AOR = 0.115, 95% CI = 0.026, 0.508, p-value < 0.01) and those who lack source of information (AOR = 0. 084, 95% CI = 0.022, 0.322, p-value < 0.01) were less likely to have good self-care practice. But, participants who had convenient place for exercise (AOR = 2.968, 95% CI = 1.826, 4.825, p-value < 0.01), who had good social support (AOR = 2.204, 95% CI = 1.272, 3.821, p-value < 0.01), who had traditional clergy-based teaching (AOR = 2.209, 95% CI = 1.064, 4.584, p-value < 0.05), and who had good self-care agency (AOR = 1.222, 2.956, p-value < 0.05) were more likely to have good self-care practice.
   Conclusion: Most of the study participants reported poor self-care practices. Factors associated with hypertension self-care practice are marital status, education, source of self-care information, place for exercise, social support, and self-care agency. Targeted interventions are needed to improve hypertension self-care practice.

ID PREVENTIVE SERVICES; PUBLIC-HEALTH; US; ORGANIZATIONS; BENEFICIARIES;
   DISPARITIES; QUALITY; IMPACT
AB Background: Health care reform is changing preventive services delivery. This study explored trajectories in colorectal cancer (CRC) testing over a 5-year period that included implementation of 16 Medicaid Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs, 2012) and Medicaid expansion (2014) - two provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - within the state of Oregon, USA.
   Methods: Retrospective analysis of Oregon's Medicaid claims for enrollee's eligible for CRC screening (50-64 years) spanning January 2010 through December 2014. Our analysis was conducted and refined April 2016 through June 2018. The analysis assessed the annual probability of patients receiving CRC testing and the modality used (e.g., colonoscopy, fecal testing) relative to a baseline year (2010). We hypothesized that CRC testing would increase following Medicaid ACO formation - called Coordinated Care Organizations (CCOs).
   Results: A total of 132,424 unique Medicaid enrollees (representing 255,192 person-years) met inclusion criteria over the 5-year study. Controlling for demographic and regional factors, the predicted probability of CRC testing was significantly higher in 2014 (+ 1.4 percentage points, p < 0.001) compared to the 2010 baseline but not in 2012 or 2013. Increased fecal testing using Fecal Occult Blood Tests (FOBT) or Fecal Immunochemical Tests (FIT) played a prominent role in 2014. The uptick in statewide fecal testing appears driven primarily by a subset of CCOs.
   Conclusions: Observed CRC testing did not immediately increase following the transition to CCOs in 2012. However increased testing in 2014, may reflect a delay in implementation of interventions to increase CRC screening and/or a strong desire by newly insured Medicaid CCO members to receive preventive care.

SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Admitted patient; Nursing care; Interaction model; Amhara region
ID QUALITY; VERSION; SCALE
AB Background: Nursing care plays a prominent role in determining the overall satisfaction of patients' hospitalization experience. Studies have shown that satisfaction with nursing care is the best indicator of patients' satisfaction with healthcare facilities. The aim of the current study was intended to determine the level of satisfaction and identifying factors towards nursing care from the admitted adult patients' viewpoints.
   Method: The study was done from January 01 to February 01/ 2017 at three public hospitals of Amhara region using an institutional cross-sectional study design. Systematic random sampling technique was employed to recruit 585 sampled study participants. Patient Satisfaction with Nursing Care Scale was utilized to collect the data. Variables which had statistically significant association with the outcome variable (P < 0.05) were identified as significant in the multivariable logistic regression analysis.
   Result: A total of 563 patients participated. The overall admitted adult patient satisfaction with nursing care was 40.7%. Patients were more satisfied with the provision of health information, affective support, and professional technical control and least satisfied with decisional control which includes allowing patients and their attendants in the involvement of care. Being governmental employee, patients in the age group of 31-40 years and 4-8 patients in a single room were least satisfied with the nursing care whereas ever married, more educated and patients admitted to the surgical ward were more satisfied than their counterparts with nursing care.
   Conclusion: The overall level of patient satisfaction in this study was very low in comparison with many studies. This may urge hospital administrators, policymakers and nurses to be more sensitive with patients' decisional control or sense of autonomy when providing care.

DE Bovine; Fascioliasis; Economic loss; Lymnaea; Zambia
ID CATTLE; PROVINCE; KAFUE; AREAS
AB Background: Fascioliasis is a trematode zoonotic snail-borne disease of public health and economic importance. The disease causes liver damage and is hardly recognized by medical personnel hence, is rarely considered as the differential diagnosis. In animals, the disease leads to mortalities, growth retardation, drop in livestock production and condemnation of the infected livers during meat inspection.
   The cross-sectional study was conducted from 2013 to 2017 in abattoirs in Mongu district, Western province of Zambia. Each selected carcass was examined macroscopically for bovine fascioliasis by dissecting the liver and checking for adult liver flukes. Infested and condemned livers were weighed and incinerated.
   Results: A total of 69,152 carcasses with their livers was examined at the abattoirs for adult Fasciola worms and 44,511 (64.4%) were positive. According to the intensity of pathological lesions, 55.3% constituted severely affected livers, 30.3% were moderately affected livers and 14.4% were lightly affected livers. Our observation revealed that the most prevalent liver fluke identified was Fasciola gigantic-a (56.1%) and it mostly affected the poor body conditioned animals (71.4%). The study also indicated that 164,600 kg liver was condemned and destroyed.
   This reduced the income base for small-scale livestock farmers to about ZMW 7,407,000.00, which was equivalent to 592,560 USD.
   Conclusion: In conclusion, our study suggests that the prevalence of bovine fascioliasis was high resulting in a large amount of liver being condemned and destroyed, leading to economic losses for affected livestock farmers in the area. Consequently, there is a need to take the necessary measures to control the disease and create awareness among medical personnel to consider it as a differential diagnosis in all functional liver deficiencies due to the zoonotic nature of the disease.

AB BackgroundIn 2014, the Ethiopian government passed a new smoking legislation that banned smoking in public and workplaces including health care facilities. However, data's on level of non-compliance and associated factors with non-compliance towards smoke-free legislation in hospital settings of the country has not been studied yet.MethodsHospital-based Cross-sectional study design triangulated with observational study was conducted in five hospitals. Data were collected through direct observation and interviews using checklist, structured and pre-tested questionnaires for observational study and survey of hospital employee respectively. Nine data collectors and one supervisor were involved in data collection. Three hundred fifty (350) health care staffs were interviewed. Fifteen (15) buildings were purposively observed for observational non-compliance in the selected hospitals. Data were entered by Epi Info and analyzed using SPSS version 21 software. Logistic regression was used to compute the crude and adjusted odds ratios for the factors affecting employee non-compliance with the legislation. A p-value of <0.05 at 95% CI was considered to be statistically significant.ResultsAnti-smoking signs were absent from a high proportion of hospital areas (97% overall) although visible cigarette butts were generally not observed in most areas of the hospitals. Non-compliance level among health care staffs was 50(10.3%).Associated factors affecting to the non-compliance level of the staff were: being male (AOR=5.89, p value=0.001), having poor knowledge (AOR=2.71, p-value=0.022) and having Unfavorable attitudes (AOR=6.15, p-value=0.000).ConclusionsNon-compliance level was high and needs careful implementation for 100% smoke-free legislation in addressing knowledge and attitudes of health care staffs.

AB BackgroundChronic diseases have emerged as the leading cause of death globally, and 20% of Indians are estimated to suffer from a chronic condition. Care for chronic diseases poses a major public health challenge, especially when health care delivery has been geared traditionally towards acute care. In this study, we aimed to better understand how primary care for diabetes and hypertension is currently organised in first-line health facilities in rural India, and propose evidence-based ways forward for strengthening local health systems to address chronic problems.MethodsWe used qualitative and quantitative methods to gain insight into how care is organised and how patients and providers manage within this delivery system. We conducted in-depth interviews with the medical doctors working in three private clinics and in three public primary health centres. We also interviewed 24 patients with chronic diseases receiving care in the two sub-sectors. Non-participant observations and facility assessments were performed to triangulate the findings from the interviews.ResultsThe current delivery system has many problems impeding the delivery of quality care for chronic conditions. In both the public and private facilities studied, the care processes are very doctor-centred, with little room for other health centre staff. Doctors face very high workloads, especially in the public sector, jeopardising proper communication with patients and adequate counselling. In addition, the health information system is fragmented and provides little or no support for patient follow-up and self-management. The patient is largely left on their own in trying to make sense of their condition and in finding their way in a complex and scattered health care landscape.ConclusionsThe design and organisation of care for persons with chronic diseases in India needs to be rethought. More space and responsibility should be given to the primary care level, and relatively less to the more specialised hospital level. Furthermore, doctors should consider delegating some of their tasks to other staff in the first-line health facility to significantly reduce their workload and increase time available for communication. The health information system needs to be adapted to better ensure continuity of care and support self-management by patients.

TI Can mentorship improve laboratory quality? A case study from influenza
   diagnostic laboratories in Southeast Europe
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID SYSTEMS
AB BackgroundStrengthening the quality of laboratory diagnostics is a key part of building global health capacity. In 2015, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Southeast European Center for Surveillance and Control of Infectious Diseases (SECID), WHO European Regional Office (WHO EURO) and American Public Health Laboratories (APHL) collaborated to address laboratory quality training needs in Southeast Europe. Together, they developed a quality assurance (QA) mentorship program for six national laboratories (Laboratories A-E) in five countries utilizing APHL international consultants. The primary goal of the mentorship program was to help laboratories become recognized by WHO as National Influenza Centers (NICs). The program aimed to do this by strengthening influenza laboratory capacity by implementing quality management systems (QMS) action steps. After 1 year, we evaluated participants' progress by the proportion of QMS action steps they had successfully implemented, as well as the value of mentorship as perceived by laboratory mentees, mentors, and primary program stakeholders from SECID and WHO EURO.MethodsTo understand perceived value we used the qualitative method of semi-structured interviews, applying grounded theory to the thematic analysis.ResultsMentees showed clear progress, having completed 32 to 68% [median: 62%] of planned QMS action steps in their laboratories. In regards to the perceived value of the program, we found strong evidence that laboratory mentorship enhances laboratory quality improvement by promoting accountability to QMS implementation, raising awareness of the importance of QMS, and fostering collaborative problem solving.ConclusionIn conclusion, we found that significant accomplishments can be achieved when QA programs provide dedicated technical mentorship for QMS implementation. Since the start of the mentoring, Laboratory B has achieved NIC recognition by WHO, while two other labs made substantial progress and are scheduled for recognition in 2018. In the future, we recommend that mentorship is more inclusive of laboratory directors, and that programs evaluate the amount of staff time needed for mentorship activities, including lab-based assessments and mentoring.

AB BackgroundDespite progress towards achieving UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals, barriers persist in laboratory systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) restricting scale up of early infant diagnosis (EID) and viral load (VL) test monitoring of patients on antiretroviral therapy. If these facilities and system challenges persist, they may undermine recorded gains and appropriate management of patients. The aim of this review is to identify Public Private Partnerships (PPP) in SSA that have resolved systemic barriers within the VL and EID treatment cascade and demonstrated impact in the scale up of VL and EID.MethodsWe queried five HIV and TB laboratory databases from 2007 to 2017 for studies related to laboratory system strengthening and PPP. We identified, screened and included PPPs that demonstrated evidence in alleviating known system level barriers to scale up national VL and EID testing programs. PPPs that improved associated systems from the point of viral load test request to the use of the test result for patient management were deemed eligible.ResultsWe identified six PPPs collaborations with multiple activities in select countries that are contributing to address challenges to scale up national viral load programs. One of the six PPPs reached 14.5 million patients in remote communities and transported up to 400,000 specimens in a year. Another PPP enabled an unprecedented 94% of specimens to reach national laboratory through improved sample referral network and enabled a cost savings of 62%. Also PPPs reduced cost of reagents and enabled 300,000 tested infants to be enrolled in care as well as reduced turnaround time of reporting results by 50%.ConclusionsOur review identified the benefits, enabling factors, and associated challenges for public and private sectors to engage in PPPs. PPP contributions to laboratory systems strengthening are a model and present opportunities that can be leveraged to strengthen systems to achieve the UNAIDS 90-90-90 treatment targets for HIV/AIDS. Despite growing emphasis on engaging the private sector as a critical partner to address global disease burden, PPPs that specifically strengthen laboratories, the cornerstone of public health programs, remain largely untapped.

AB BackgroundAfghanistan faces a high burden of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including pre-eclampsia and eclampsia (PE/E), are among the most common causes of maternal and neonatal complications. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy can lead to fatal complications for both the mother and fetus. The 2016 Afghanistan National Maternal and Newborn Health Quality of Care Assessment assessed quality of early detection and management of PE/E in health facilities and skilled birth attendants' (SBAs) perceptions of their working environment.MethodsAll accessible public health facilities with an average of at least five births per day (n=77), a nationally representative sample of public health facilities with less than five births per day (n=149), and 20 purposively selected private health facilities were assessed. Methods included a facility inventory and record review, interviews with SBAs, and direct clinical observation of antenatal care (ANC), intrapartum care and immediate postnatal care (PNC), as well as severe PE/E case management.ResultsMost facilities had supplies and medicines for early detection and management of PE/E.At public health facilities, 357 of 414 (86.2%) clients observed during ANC consultations had their blood pressure checked and 159 (38.4%) were asked if they had experienced symptoms of PE/E. Only 553 of 734 (72.6%) SBAs interviewed were able to correctly identify severe pre-eclampsia described in a case scenario. Of 29 PE/E cases observed, 17 women (59%) received the correct loading dose of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and 12 women (41%) received the correct maintenance dose of MgSO4.At private health facilities, 39 of 45 ANC clients had their blood pressure checked and 9 of 45 (20%) were asked about symptoms of PE/E. Fifty-four of 64(84.4%) SBAs in private facilities correctly identified severe pre-eclampsia described in a case scenario.ConclusionNotable gaps in SBAs' knowledge and clinical practices in detection and management of PE/E in various health facilities increase the risk of maternal and perinatal mortality. Continuing education of health care providers and increased investment in focused quality improvement initiatives will be critical to improve the quality of health care services in Afghanistan.

AB BackgroundThis paper reports on a five-year study using a theory-based program logic evaluation, and supporting survey and interview data to examine the extent to which the activites of the South Australian Health in All Policies initiative can be linked to population health outcomes.MethodsMixed-methods data were collected between 2012 and 2016 in South Australia (144 semi-structured key informant interviews; two electronic surveys of public servants in 2013 (n=435) and 2015 (n=483); analysis of state government policy documents; and construction of a program logic model to shape assessment of the feasibility of attribution to population health outcomes).ResultsMultiple actions on social determinants of health in a range of state government sectors were reported and most could be linked through a program logic model to making some contribution to future population health outcomes. Context strongly influences implementation; not all initiatives will be successful and experimentation is vital. Successful initiatives included HiAP influencing the urban planning department to be more concerned with the health impacts of planning decisions, and encouraging the environment department to be concerned with the health impacts of its work.ConclusionsThe theory-based program logic suggests that SA HiAP facilitated improved population health through working with multiple government departments. Public servants came to appreciate how their sectors impact on health. Program logic is a mechanism to evaluate complex public health interventions in a way that takes account of political and economic contexts. SA HiAP was mainly successful in avoiding lifestyle drift in strategy. The initiative encouraged a range of state government departments to tackle conditions of daily living. The broader underpinning factors dictating the distribution of power, money and resources were not addressed by HiAP. This reflects HiAP's use of a consensus model which was driven by (rather than drove) state priorities and sought win-win' strategies.

AB BackgroundDaily behaviours such as active commuting to school (ACS) could be a source of physical activity, contributing to the improvement of youth cardiovascular health, however, the relationship between ACS and other aspects of a youth's health, such as sleep duration and breakfast consumption, require further clarification. The aims of this study were therefore: 1) to analyse the prevalence of modes of commuting to school, sleep duration, and breakfast consumption by age groups and gender, and 2) to analyse the association between ACS, sleep duration recommendations, and breakfast consumption by age groups and gender.MethodThis cross-sectional study included 732 school-aged students of low-middle socioeconomic status, categorised into children (10-12yr), young adolescents (13-15yr), and older adolescents (16-18yr). Modes of commuting to/from school, sleep duration, and breakfast consumption were self-reported. Logistic regression models were fitted to examine the association between ACS, sleep duration and breakfast consumption, analysed according to age groups and gender.ResultsThe percentage of students meeting sleep duration and daily breakfast recommendations was lowest in older adolescents, and highest in children (6.3% versus 50.8% p<0.001, and 62.1%, versus 76.8%, p=0.001, respectively). Young adolescents and girls who met the sleep duration recommendations were more likely to be active commuters than their counterparts (OR=4.25; 95% CI=1.81 to 9.92, p=0.001 and OR=2.89; 95%CI=1.01 to 8.27, p=0.04, respectively).ConclusionYoung adolescents (13-15yr) and girls who met the sleep duration recommendations during school days displayed a positive association with ACS. There was no association between ACS and breakfast consumption for any of the age groups or gender. Children (10-12yr) were those that best meet with the adequate sleep duration and breakfast consumption recommendations.

AB BackgroundThe growing number of sport-based youth development interventions provide a potential avenue for integrating sport meaningfully into the U.S. public health agenda. However, efficacy and quality must be reliably established prior to widespread implementation.MethodsA comprehensive search of databases, peer-reviewed journals, published reviews, and both published and unpublished documents yielded 10,077 distinct records. Title and abstract screening, followed by full-text screening using 6 criteria, resulted in 56 distinct studies (coalescing into 10 sport-based youth development intervention types) included in the synthesis. These studies were then independently assessed and critically appraised.ResultsLimited efficacy data were identified, with the quality of methods and evidence largely classified as weak. Processes likely to contribute to the outcomes of sport-based youth development interventions were identified (e.g., predictors of ongoing engagement, alignment between target population and intervention, intervention design), although more rigorous research is needed on these and other processes. Physical health outcomes were only studied in 3 of the 10 intervention types.ConclusionsThe evidence base does not yet warrant wide-scale implementation of sport-based youth development interventions for public health goals within the U. S., although there is promising research that identifies areas for further exploration.

AB BackgroundAn alarm increase the rate of emerging and re-emerging of multidrug resistant bacteria have been caused great public health concern in the worldwide. They have been resisting for most or majority of currently available and affordable antibiotics and imposed socioeconomic catastrophe at global scale. As a result, there is utmost important to discover new or modify currently available antibiotics. The aim of this study was to evaluate combined antibacterial effect of essential oils obtained from Blepharis cuspidata, Boswellia ogadensis and Thymus schimper against multidrug resistance (MDR) Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Methicillin resistant S. aureus.MethodsEssential oil (EO) was extracted from the aerial part of B. cuspidata, B.ogadensis and T. schimper by steam distillation and stored in brown bottles at 4 degrees C. There were mixed in 1:1 ratio and adsorbed to disc and placed on MHA and measured their minimum inhibitory zone seeded with E. coli, K. pneumoniae and MRAS after 18-24H. minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were measured by broth micro-dilution method. The interaction between EOs was determined by fractional inhibitory concentration index.ResultsThe antibacterial potential of mixed oil depends on the doses and type of the EOs and bacteria species. The combined EOs of B.cuspidata and T.schimperi had inhibition zone (39mm), its MIC and MBC value was 0.39l/ml against MRSA. It had inhibition zone (28-35mm), MIC value 0.39-6.25l/ml and MBC (0.78-12.5l/ml) against MDR E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Whereas, combined effects of B. cuspidata and B. ogadensis had MIC values ranges from 0.78-6.25l/ml for E.coli and K. pneumoniae and 1.56l/ml for MRSA. There was strong synergistic effect between the combination of B.cuspidata and T.schimperi. This study revealed that gram negative bacteria were slightly less susceptible than gram positive.ConclusionsThis in vitro study of combined EOs has significant antibacterial effect than using each of them and even it was more potent antibacterial effect on MDR as compare to modern antibiotics. Hence, it can be applied to a pharmaceutical composition as modulator or adjuvant or precursor for synthesis of new antibiotic in future activities.

AB BackgroundThe English national health system experienced a major reorganisation in April 2013. This mixed methods study examined how staff managed to deliver the national immunisation programme within a new health infrastructure and explored the role and contribution of partnership working' to programme implementation.MethodsA cross-sectional online questionnaire survey and a qualitative evaluation of an urban immunisation board were conducted in 2016. The questionnaire included 38 questions about immunisation responsibilities, collaboration, service evaluation and programme support. It was completed by 199 immunisation providers and 70 people involved in the management of the immunisation programme. The evaluation involved 12 semi-structured interviews, 3 observations of forum meetings and the review of forum meeting minutes. Descriptive statistical analysis of the survey data was performed using SPSS version 23 and qualitative data from both study components were uploaded to NVivo 11 and analysed thematically.ResultsScreening and Immunisation Teams were cited as responsible for programme leadership by 56% of survey respondents, but concerns were raised about their capacity to oversee larger geographies and a case made for decentralised accountability mechanisms. Only 44% of immunisation managers stated that poor performance was addressed adequately, and half of respondents thought that support given to providers was inadequate. Managers reported that partnership working improved the organisation (83%) and performance (78%) of immunisation, but stated it was more beneficial for information-sharing than implementation. A preference for a locality working approach with committees covering smaller health economies rather than larger commissioning areas was voiced. The immunisation board examined in the qualitative evaluation sought to achieve this by forging links with locally based steering committees, but also had to address internal challenges related to the role of the board and contribution of members to programmatic decision-making.ConclusionsKey challenges in delivering the immunisation programme were rooted in the new health infrastructure, which had created greater distance between commissioners and providers and resulted in the fragmentation of programme responsibilities. Partnership working bridged gaps but more needs to be done to strengthen accountability mechanisms and ensure that collaborative activities are outcome oriented and sustainable in the shifting environment of reorganisation.

AB BackgroundOn April 28, 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared polio a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHIC) under the authority of the International Health Regulations. Although polio has been eradicated from nearly every nation on earth, Pakistan is one of three countries where wild polio and vaccine-derived polio strains remain, thwarting global eradication efforts.AimsPolio eradication progress is complicated by security and conflict issues at the border area between Pakistan and Afghanistan. In addition to security issues,other critical challenges, such as maintaining cold supply chain for vaccines, active and sentinel surveillance, false beliefs about vaccines, distrust of healthcare workers, and accessibility to conflict areas due to terrorist activities, all play a role in the continued persistence of Polio. In response to these challenges, weassess the local and international policy environment and its impact on polio eradication in Pakistan.FindingsBased on our analysis of existing barriers and challenges associated with polio eradication in Pakistan, this study discusses why employing vaccine diplomacy represents a key policy and advocacy strategic approach to achieve the overall end game of polio eradication. Specifically, we identify a set of concrete public health, international development, and diplomatic and policy recommendations that can act synergistically under the umbrella of health and vaccine diplomacy to finally put an end to polio.

AB BackgroundThis study aimed to describe the most recent prevalence estimates of adolescent body mass index (BMI) and physical fitness from thirteen regions in Shandong Province, China and to examine differences by social-economic status (SES).MethodsThe participants were 27,955 adolescents (mean age=14.41.8years; 13,791 girls) enrolled from 91 public middle and high schools randomly selected from 13 administrative regions in Shandong Province. The Chinese National Student Physical Fitness Standard was employed to assess participants' fitness once during the school semester. Fitness assessments included BMI, a 50-m sprint run, sit-and-reach, standing-broad jump, sit-ups, pull-ups, and a 1000m/boy or 800m/girl distance run. Participants' fitness performance was categorized as excellent, good, pass, or no pass.ResultsThe percent of Chinese adolescents categorized as no pass ranged from just 8.9% for BMI to 67.1% for boy pull-ups. The percent of Chinese adolescents categorized as excellent ranged from 5.0% for the girl sit-ups to 35.4% for the 50-m sprint run. Approximately 8.4% of the sample was categorized as excellent for BMI. SES significantly predicted both girl and boy continuous distance run scores (p<0.05). Adolescents in lower SES strata had lower odds of achieving pass or better on cardio-respiratory endurance tests, muscular fitness tests, and flexibility tests, but higher odds of achieving pass or better on BMI compared to adolescents who were high SES (p<0.05).Conclusions p id=Par4 The large sample of the adolescents in Shandong province, on average, had healthy weight status and achieved a high prevalence of pass or better on physical fitness tests. Adolescents who were low SES demonstrated poorer cardio-respiratory endurance, muscular fitness, and flexibility test achievement but better BMI achievement compared to high SES adolescents in Shandong Province, China.

AB Bacterial meningitis is a public health crisis in the northern part of Ghana, where it contributes to very high mortality and morbidity rates. Early detection of the causative organism will lead to better management and effective treatment. Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of Pastorex and Wellcogen latex agglutination tests for the detection of bacterial meningitis in a resource-limited setting. CSF samples from 330 suspected meningitis patients within the northern zone of Ghana were analysed for bacterial agents at the zonal Public Health Reference Laboratory in Tamale using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and two latex agglutination test kits; Pastorex and Wellcogen. The overall positivity rate of samples tested for bacterial meningitis was 46.4%. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common cause of bacterial meningitis within the sub-region, with positivity rate of 25.2%, 28.2% and 28.8% when diagnosed using Wellcogen, Pastorex and PCR respectively. The Pastorex method was 97.4% sensitive while the Wellcogen technique was 87.6% sensitive. Both techniques however produced the same specificity of 99.4%. Our study revealed that the Pastorex method has a better diagnostic value for bacterial meningitis than the Wellcogen method and should be the method of choice in the absence of PCR.

TI Open-source food: Nutrition, toxicology, and availability of wild edible
   greens in the East Bay
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PLANTS; ACCUMULATION; HEALTH; RISK
AB Significance
   Foraged leafy greens are consumed around the globe, including in urban areas, and may play a larger role when food is scarce or expensive. It is thus important to assess the safety and nutritional value of wild greens foraged in urban environments.
   Methods
   Field observations, soil tests, and nutritional and toxicology tests on plant tissue were conducted for three sites, each roughly 9 square blocks, in disadvantaged neighborhoods in the East San Francisco Bay Area in 2014-2015. The sites included mixed-use areas and areas with high vehicle traffic.
   Results
   Edible wild greens were abundant, even during record droughts. Soil at some survey sites had elevated concentrations of lead and cadmium, but tissue tests suggest that rinsed greens of the tested species are safe to eat. Daily consumption of standard servings comprise less than the EPA reference doses of lead, cadmium, and other heavy metals. Pesticides, glyphosate, and PCBs were below detection limits. The nutrient density of 6 abundant species compared favorably to that of the most nutritious domesticated leafy greens.
   Conclusions
   Wild edible greens harvested in industrial, mixed-use, and high-traffic urban areas in the San Francisco East Bay area are abundant and highly nutritious. Even grown in soils with elevated levels of heavy metals, tested species were safe to eat after rinsing in tap water. This does not mean that all edible greens growing in contaminated soil are safe to eat-tests on more species, in more locations, and over a broader range of soil chemistry are needed to determine what is generally safe and what is not. But it does suggest that wild greens could contribute to nutrition, food security, and sustainability in urban ecosystems. Current laws, regulations, and public-health guidance that forbid or discourage foraging on public lands, including urban areas, should be revisited.

ID SOUTH-AFRICA; PREDICTORS
AB BackgroundTuberculosis (TB) continues to be the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals in Sub Saharan Africa including Tanzania. Provision of isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) is one of the public health interventions to reduce the burden of TB among HIV infected persons. However there is limited information about the influence of IPT on TB incidence in Tanzania. This study aimed at ascertaining the effect of IPT on TB incidence and to determine risk factors for TB among HIV positive adults in Dar es Salaam region.MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted using secondary data of HIV positive adults receiving care and treatment services in Dar es Salaam region from 2011 to 2014. TB incidence rate among HIV positive adults on IPT was compared to those who were not on IPT during the follow up period. Risk factors for incident TB were estimated using multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model.ResultsA total of 68,378 HIV positive adults were studied. The median follow up time was 3.4 (IQR=1.9-3.8) years for patients who ever received IPT and 1.3 (IQR=0.3-1.3) years among those who never received IPT. A total of 3124TB cases occurred during 114,926 total person-years of follow up. The overall TB incidence rate was 2.7/100 person-years (95%CI; 2.6-2.8). Patients on IPT had 48% lower TB incidence rate compared to patients who were not on IPT (IRR=0.52, 95%CI; 0.46-0.59). Factors associated with higher risk for incident TB included; being male (aHR=1.8, 95% CI; 1.6-2.0), WHO stage III (aHR=2.7, 95% CI; 2.3-3.3) and IV (aHR=2.4, 95% CI; 1.9-3.1),being underweight (aHR=1.7, 95% CI; 1.5-1.9) while overweight (aHR=0.7, 95% CI; 0.6-0.8), obese (aHR=0.5, 95% CI; 0.4-0.7), having baseline CD4 cell count between 200 and 350 cells/l (aHR=0.7, 95% CI; 0.6-0.8) and CD4 count above 350 cells/l (aHR=0.5, 95% CI; 0.4-0.6) were associated with lower risk of developing TB.ConclusionIsoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) has shown to be effective in reducing TB incidence among HIV infected adults in Dar es Salaam. More efforts are needed to increase the provision and coverage of IPT.

AB BackgroundBirth defects (BD) are considered a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality. Personal, cultural, and health care system barriers may increase the incidence of BD in low and middle income countries. In this study we assessed the knowledge of antenatal mothers on BD, associated factors, and prevention and management.MethodsThree hundred and fifty (350) antenatal mothers were surveyed using a pretested, self-administered questionnaire. The knowledge on BD was evaluated under 3 categories; knowledge on BD, knowledge on associated factors, and knowledge on prevention and management. The total scores were calculated for each category and converted into percentages. Ahigher percentage score indicates a high level of knowledge.Descriptive statistics and regression models were used for data analysis. Level of significance was considered as p<0.05.ResultsMean age of the participants was 28.7years (SD=5.2). The age range was 17-44years. Most of the participants (79%) had studied up to secondary or tertiary education. The average scores of knowledge on BD, associated factors, and prevention and management of BD were 57.6% (95% CI=52.3-62.9%), 55.1% (95% CI=49.8-60.4%) and 58.8% (95% CI=53.5-64.1%) respectively. The average score on the overall total knowledge was 56.4% (95% CI=51.1-61.7%). Mother's level of education, monthly income of the family and number of clinic visits made by the mother were found to be positively associated with the overall knowledge. About 62% of the participants had taken folic acid (FA) preconceptionally, a major preventive factor of BD associated with the nervous system. Folic acid intake was positively associated with age and educational level, but negatively associated with parity. Media (36.9%) and Public Health Midwives (PHMs) (20%) were found to be the major sources of knowledge on BD, associated factors and prevention in this target group.ConclusionsThe average overall knowledge on BD in this group of antenatal mothers was moderate. Thus, there is a need to improve the knowledge in eligible women to reduce the occurrence of BD, ideally before they become pregnant. Media and PHMs were seem to be the effective and possible resources that can be used to educate the community on BD, associated factors and prevention of BD in Sri Lanka.

AB BackgroundTuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health concern on a global scale, especially in developing nations. So far, no formal guidelines are available for the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis pleurisy. The diagnosis of TB is worsened by the immense difficulty in differential determination of tuberculosis pleural effusion (TPE) and malignant pleural effusion (MPE). The purpose of this investigation is to assess the differential diagnostic efficiencies of the pleural IFN- release assay (IGRA) and widely-used biochemical parameters in the distinction analysis of TPE and MPE.MethodsA cohort of 222 patients with pleural effusion was examined, comprising of 143 TPE and 58 MPE patients. The patients were examined with IGRA, and the widely-used biomarkers in the pleural effusion and peripheral blood.ResultsOur results show that the TPE patients have significantly higher M. tuberculosis (Mtb) antigen-specific IFN- responses to ESAT-6 protein and peptide pool in the blood compared to MPE patients. TPE patients were also shown to have enriched Mtb antigen-specific IFN- responses in pleural effusion than in peripheral blood. Among the widely-used biomarkers, the adenosine deaminase (ADA) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in pleural effusion were better biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity to discriminate TPE and MPE. In addition, pleural IGRA could not be affected by the pleural adhesion, and the applications of the pleural IGRA together with ADA and CEA provide a promising approach for the TPE and MPE differential identification.ConclusionsOur study proposes that the integration of pleural IGRA and ADA, CEA detection could add to more effective diagnosis stratagems in the discernment between TPE and MPE.

AB BackgroundAs health is influenced by the social, economic and environmental conditions in which individuals live, local communities are an ideal setting to promote health and wellbeing. However, up to now various health promotion interventions at the community level have had limited success, perhaps related to an incomplete understanding of local contexts and priorities. We therefore aimed to develop a broader and deeper understanding of topics or issues that were most salient to residents of a South-West German community by exploring their perceptions of needs, challenges, barriers and existing resources related to health and well-being.MethodsAs an initial step of a multi-year community-based participatory research project, we conducted semi-structured interviews with key informants (n=30) from various community settings (e.g., child care, elderly care, businesses, non-profit organizations, village councils, and local government). The terms health and wellbeing were included in the stem of each question in the semi-structured interview guide to enable a focus on related perceived needs, challenges, barriers and existing resources. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using qualitative content analysis techniques.ResultsThemes emerging from our interviews appeared to center primarily in three distinct areas: natural resources and built environment, access to services, and social cohesion including subthemes on the importance of social engagement and volunteerism, sense of community, and shared identity.ConclusionsThat health and wellbeing were not identified explicitly as a priority by key informants suggests that these should not be presented as the primary focus of a community-wide initiative. Instead themes with a higher priority should be addressed in ways that can lead to better health and wellbeing as a secondary goal.

TI Adjunct phage treatment enhances the effectiveness of low antibiotic

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID BACTERIOPHAGE THERAPY; PSEUDOMONAS; RESISTANCE; INFECTIONS
AB Phage therapy is drawing more interest as antibiotic resistance becomes an ever more serious threat to public health. Bacterial biofilms represent a major obstacle in the fight against bacterial infections as they are inherently refractory to many types of antibiotics. Treating biofilms with phage has shown promise in a handful of experimental and case studies. However, quantification of the effect of phage combined with antibiotics is needed to pave the way for larger clinical trials. Here we explore the effect of using phage in combination with a total of nine antibiotics, applied simultaneously or as a pretreatment before antibiotics are applied to in vitro biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus. Most antibiotics alone were ineffective at low concentration (2xMIC), but the addition of phage to treatment regimens led to substantial improvements in efficacy. At high concentration (10xMIC), antibiotics alone were effective, and in most cases the addition of phage to treatment regimens did not improve efficacy. Using phage with rifampin was also very effective at reducing the outgrowth of resistant strains during the course of treatment.

TI Exclusive breastfeeding and associated factors among HIV positive
   mothers in Northern Ethiopia
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   It is estimated that sub-optimal feeding, especially non-exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6months of life, results in 1.4million deaths and 10% of disease burden in children younger than five years. Worldwide, it is estimated that only 34.8% of infants are exclusively breastfed for the first 6months of life, the majority receiving some other food or fluid in the early months. Besides, the Ethiopian demographic and health survey (2016) stated that the median duration of exclusive breastfeeding in Tigray region was 3.8 months which is shorter than the recommended duration. The main purpose of this study was to determine the magnitude of exclusive breastfeeding practice and associated factors among HIV positive mothers in public hospitals of Tigray region, Northern Ethiopia.
   Methods
   A facility based cross-sectional study was conducted from July 9 to October 11, 2016, in public hospitals of Tigray region. Data was collected by using structured questionnaire using face-to-face interview among 304 eligible women through a systematic sampling technique. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 20.0. Binary and multiple variable logistic regressions ("odds ratio") analyses were calculated with 95% CI and p value <= 0.05 as significance were used.
   Result
   Two hundred seventy (88.8%) of mothers practiced exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life. Infant feeding counseling during antenatal care of last pregnancy [AOR = 6.9, 95% CI; 2.63, 17.99], knowledge on exclusive breastfeeding (AOR = 5.5, 95% CI; (2.12, 14.02] and attitude towards exclusive breastfeeding [AOR = 7.9; 95% CI; 2.96, 21.21] had significant association with exclusive breastfeeding practice.
   Conclusions
   A high proportion of mothers practiced exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life. Infant feeding counseling, knowledge and attitude towards exclusive breastfeeding practice were the predictors of exclusive breastfeeding among HIV positive mothers. Strengthening infant feeding counseling during antenatal care and improving mothers' knowledge and attitude on exclusive breastfeeding is essential.

TI Unravelling how and why the Antiretroviral Adherence Club Intervention
   works (or not) in a public health facility: A realist explanatory
   theory-building case study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID THERAPY PATIENTS; CAPE-TOWN; IMPLEMENTATION; CONTEXT; CARE
AB Background
   Although empirical evidence suggests that the adherence club model is more effective in retaining people living with HIV in antiretroviral treatment care and sustaining medication adherence compared to standard clinic care, it is poorly understood exactly how and why this works. In this paper, we examined and made explicit how, why and for whom the adherence club model works at a public health facility in South Africa.
   Methods
   We applied an explanatory theory-building case study approach to examine the validity of an initial programme theory developed a priori. We collected data using a retrospective cohort quantitative design to describe the suppressive adherence and retention in care behaviours of patients on ART using Kaplan-Meier methods. In conjunction, we employed an explanatory qualitative study design using non-participant observations and realist interviews to gain insights into the important mechanisms activated by the adherence club intervention and the relevant contextual conditions that trigger the different mechanisms to cause the observed behaviours. We applied the retroduction logic to configure the intervention- context-actor-mechanism-outcome map to formulate generative theories.
   Results
   A modified programme theory involving targeted care for clinically stable adult patients (18 years+) receiving antiretroviral therapy was obtained. Targeted care involved receiving quick, uninterrupted supply of antiretroviral medication (with reduced clinic visit frequencies), health talks and counselling, immediate access to a clinician when required and guided by club rules and regulations within the context of adequate resources, and convenient (size and position) space and proper preparation by the club team. When grouped for targeted care, patients feel nudged, their self-efficacy is improved and they become motivated to adhere to their medication and remain in continuous care.
   Conclusion
   This finding has implications for understanding how, why and under what health system conditions the adherence club intervention works to improve its rollout in other contexts.

DE Undernutrition; Good governance; Public health expenditures;

ID MORTALITY; OUTCOMES
AB BackgroundChild undernutrition remains the major public health problem in low and middle-income countries including Ethiopia. The effects of good governance, urbanization and public health expenditure on childhood undernutrition are not well studied in developing countries. The objective of the study is to examine the relationship between quality of governance, public health expenditures, urbanization and child undernutrition in Ethiopia.MethodsThis is pooled data analysis with ecological design. We obtained data on childhood undernutrition from the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Surveys (EDHS) that were conducted in 2000, 2005, 2011 and 2016. Additionally, data on quality of governance for Ethiopia were extracted from the World Governance Indicators (WGI) and public health spending and urbanization were obtained from the World Development Indicators and United Nations' World Population Prospects (WPP) respectively. Univariate and multivariate analysis were done to assess the relationship between governance, public health expenditure and urbanization with childhood undernutrition.ResultGovernment effectiveness (adjusted odd ratio (AOR)=20.7; p=0.046), regulatory quality (AOR=0.0077; p=0.026) and control of corruption (AOR=0.0019; p=0.000) were associated with stunting. Similarly, government effectiveness (AOR=72.2; p=0.007), regulatory quality (AOR=0.0015; p=0.004) and control of corruption (AOR=0.0005; p=0.000) were associated with underweight. None of the governance indicators were associated with wasting. On the other hand, there is no statistically significant association observed between public health spending and urbanization with childhood undernutrition. However, other socio-demographic variables play a significant effect on reducing of child undernutrition.ConclusionThis study indicates that good governance in the country plays a significant role for reducing childhood undernutrition along with other socio-demographic factors. Concerned bodies should focus on improving governance and producing a quality policy and at the same time monitor its implementation and adherence.

AB BackgroundCarotid intima media thickness (cIMT) and the carotid plaque score (cPS) are valid markers for detecting subclinical atherosclerosis. Evaluation of ASI and ABI for detection of atherosclerosis is assessed in this study. Finding a model to see which individual has a risk of having atherosclerosis, so those people can be further assessed by invasive but more accurate atherosclerosis detection methods like angiography is another objective of this study.MethodsData of 212 healthy community-dwelling subjects, consisting of carotid duplex records, ASI and ABI measurements, certain laboratory tests, and related cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks were analyzed for correlations.ResultsThe ABI was independently associated with high cPS. Age, hypertension and Waist circumference are determinants of subclinical atherosclerosis as in high cIMT and high cPS.ConclusionsThe use of the ASI cannot replace carotid ultrasound in detecting subclinical atherosclerosis because it is not independently associated with high cIMT and cPS while ABI can be used in detection of high cPS in healthy community-dwelling individuals. Public health policies to encourage weight reduction and treating hypertension can help prevention of subclinical atherosclerosis in healthy community-dwelling individuals. Models consist of age, body compositions like waist circumference and hypertension history can be used in further assessment of atherosclerosis.

AB Background: Pit latrine operational management and sludge accumulation rate, presents a challenging sanitation problem in low-income urban settlements. However, these challenges have been under-researched. This study was carried out between December 2014 and September 2015 in Nakuru, Kenya. Its objectives were to determine pit latrine management activities and content accumulation rates.
   Methods: A longitudinal design was used to study 100 households and their respective pit latrines. Sludge accumulation in 73 pit latrines was monitored for 10 months using a digital laser range-finder. Data analysis included normality testing and descriptive statistics. Differences in fill up across and within the study areas were analysed using one-way analysis of variance and the Fisher's Exact Test used to determine areas with significant differences.
   Results: Sixty-one percent of the pit latrines were used as solid waste disposal points while 45% of the respondents had no hygiene awareness. The annual fill-up rate and individual sludge contribution were 0.87 +/- 0.20m3 and 41.82 l respectively. The sludge accumulation rates across the study areas had statistically significant mean differences (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Operational management and design affect the fill-up rates and post fill-up management operations. This study argues for a need to link information and awareness to users, construction artisans, property owners and local authorities on appropriate vault volumes and management practices. Linking the variables would ensure efficient sanitation service delivery and public health protection.

   Systematic review
ID RISK-FACTORS; RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS; TEXTILE WORKERS; FACTORY-WORKERS;
   FEMALE WORKERS; PREVALENCE; STRESS
AB Background: There is a paucity of literature that addresses the health vulnerabilities of readymade garment (RMG) workers in South and Southeast Asian regions. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review is to identify the distinctive types of health vulnerabilities along with the causes and consequences of these vulnerabilities of the RMG workers in South and Southeast Asian regions.
   Methods: Systematic review search methods were applied utilising the PRISMA protocol. Literature published between July 2007 to June 2017 on health vulnerabilities of the RMG workers of South and Southeast Asian countries were identified through electronic databases and manual searches.
   Results: A total number of 19 studies (16 quantitative studies, 3 mixed-method studies) were included from the primary 17,001 papers identified. The quality of these studies was assessed by using the EPHPP (effective public health practice project) and the CASP (critical appraisal skills programme) tools. From the identified studies, 14 were considered 'strong,' with the remainder assessed as 'moderate' quality. The findings reported in these studies suggest that RMG workers of South and Southeast Asian countries are prone to several health vulnerabilities which include physical and psychological issues. Further, many of these health vulnerabilities arise from the nature of the RMG workplace, and include unhygienic and unsafe working environments, hazardous conditions of the factories, and lack of safety equipment.
   Conclusions: This systematic review suggests that RMG workers' health vulnerabilities are an emerging area of inquiry that needs to be better understood and solutions identified. Little is currently known about the distinctive types of health vulnerabilities of the RMG workers of these countries, other than Bangladesh and India, due to the lack of robust studies in other South and Southeast Asian countries. Although the health vulnerabilities of the Bangladeshi and Indian RMG workers have been previously highlighted, the health vulnerabilities arising from sudden disasters in the sector remain a neglected issue.

ID BELIEFS; MEDICATIONS; ATTITUDES; ADHERENCE
AB Background: Antibiotic resistance is a global health threat. Public knowledge is considered a prerequisite for appropriate use of antibiotics and limited spread of antibiotic resistance. Our aim was to examine the level of knowledge of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance among Norwegian pharmacy customers, and to assess to which degree beliefs, attitudes and sociodemographic factors are associated with this knowledge.
   Methods: A questionnaire based, cross-sectional study was conducted among pharmacy customers in three Norwegian cities. The questionnaire covered 1) knowledge of antibiotics (13 statements) and antibiotic resistance (10 statements), 2) the general beliefs about medicines questionnaire (BMQ general) (three subdomains, four statements each), 3) attitudes toward antibiotic use (four statements), and 4) sociodemographic factors, life style and health. High knowledge level was defined as > 66% of maximum score. Factors associated with knowledge of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance were investigated through univariate and multiple linear regression. Hierarchical model regression was used to estimate a population average knowledge score weighted for age, gender and level of education.
   Results: Among 877 participants, 57% had high knowledge of antibiotics in general and 71% had high knowledge of antibiotic resistance. More than 90% knew that bacteria can become resistant against antibiotics and that unnecessary use of antibiotics can make them less effective. Simultaneously, more than 30% erroneously stated that antibiotics are effective against viruses, colds or influenza. Factors positively associated with antibiotic knowledge were health professional background, high education level, and a positive view on the value of medications in general. Male gender, a less restrictive attitude toward antibiotic use, and young age were negatively associated with antibiotic knowledge. The mean overall antibiotic knowledge score was relatively high (15.6 out of maximum 23 with estimated weighted population score at 14.8).
   Conclusions: Despite a high level of knowledge of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance among Norwegian pharmacy customers, there are obvious knowledge gaps. We suggest that action is taken to increase the knowledge level, and particularly target people in vocational, male dominated occupations outside the health service, and primary/ secondary school curricula.

ID EARLY-CHILDHOOD CARIES; ORAL-HEALTH STATUS; 6-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN
AB BackgroundDental caries is still considered a major public health concern for human beings, especially minority groups and those living in disadvantaged communities. The Lisu is a minority group in China of more than 702,000 people located primarily in Yunnan Province. The present study was aimed at studying the status of dental caries status, as well as its risk factors, among Lisu children aged 5years in Yunnan Province, China.MethodsA multistage cluster sampling method was employed for participants' recruitment. Two calibrated dentists carried out the clinical examination with dental mirrors and CPI probes under an LED headlight. The dental caries experience was assessed by the dmft index. Oral hygiene status was evaluated using the visible plaque index (VPI). Information on the child's socio-demographic characteristics and oral health-related practices were collected using a parental questionnaire. A zero-inflated negative binomial regression (ZINB) was employed to analyse the associations between the dental caries status and the children's social-demographic status and their oral health-related behaviours.ResultsIn all, 470 Lisu children aged 5 were invited, and 404 were examined. Their mean dmft (SD) and caries prevalence were 5.6 +/- 4.8 and 80%, respectively. Their mean VPI scores were 58%+/- 21%. Lisu children who brushed their teeth at least once daily had higher dmft scores, and children from high-income families were more likely to have dental caries.ConclusionThe prevalence of dental caries among Lisu children aged 5years in Yunnan, China was high, and their caries status was severe, with a majority of carious teeth untreated. The dental caries experience of Lisu children aged 5 was related to their brushing frequency and families' economic backgrounds.

AB BackgroundProducing graduates for a breadth of sectors is a priority for veterinary science programs. Undergraduate career intentions represent de-facto outcome' measures of admissions policy and curricula design, as intentions are strong predictors of eventual behaviour. Informed by Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behaviour, this study aimed to identify if contextually relevant attitudes and self-ratings affect student intentions for veterinary career sectors.ResultsSurvey responses from 844 students enrolled in five Australian veterinary programs in 2014 were analysed. Intention was measured for biomedical research/academia, industry, laboratory animal medicine, public health/government/diagnostic laboratory services, mixed practice, intensive animal production, companion animal practice, not work in the veterinary profession, and business/entrepreneurship. Hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis enabled comparison of explanation of variance in intent by demographics, animal handling experience, species preference, and attitudes to aspects of veterinary work. Career sector intentions were highest for mixed or companion animal clinical practice, then business/entrepreneurship, then non-clinical sectors. Overall, intent was explained to a greater extent by species preferences than by animal experience, attitudes to aspects of veterinary work and demographics (with the exception of mixed practice intent) with gender having no significant effect. Several variables exerted negative effects on career intent for less popular career sectors.ConclusionAjzen's Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) provides a framework to increase understanding of and predict career sector intentions. Incorporation of attitude and self-efficacy measures in our study revealed preference for species types contributes greatly to career sector intentions for veterinary students, particularly for the more popular practice based sectors. Importantly, specific species preferences and other attitudes can have a negative effect on intent for non-aligned veterinary sectors. Further research is required to identify additional attitudes and/or beliefs to better explain variance in intent for less popular career sectors. Veterinary admissions processes may benefit from utilising the TPB framework. Identified effects revealed by this study may stimulate innovation in marketing, recruitment, admissions and curricular design, such as timing and role modelling, to utilise positive effects and mitigate against negative effects identified for sectors requiring greater representation of career intent in the student body.

TI A cross-sectional study on the prevalence of antibiotic use prior to

SO PLOS ONE

ID SELF-MEDICATION; BACTEREMIA; RESISTANCE; CULTURE
AB There has been a significant rise in global antibiotic use in recent years. Development of resistance has been linked to easy accessibility, lack of regulation of sale, increased tendency to self-medicate and the lack of public knowledge. The increase in antibiotic misuse, including self-medication, has not been well documented in developing countries. Antibiotic use prior to visiting health facilities has been found to be prevalent in developing countries. It has been identified by some studies to increase the likelihood of missed diagnoses and influence the outcome of bacteriological tests. This study is aimed at determining the prevalence of prior antibiotic use through a cross-sectional survey of patients undergoing laboratory tests at two health facilities in Ghana. Face-to-face questionnaires were used to interview 261 individuals chosen by random sampling of patients visiting the bacteriology laboratory of the hospitals within a two-month period. The questionnaire investigated participant demographic characteristics, knowledge about antibiotics and the nature of antibiotic use. Antibiotic property detection bioassay was performed on patient's urine sample using a disk diffusion method to accurately determine antibiotic use within 72 hours. Culture results were used as an index to evaluate the effect of prior antibiotic use on bacteriological tests. Out of a 261 participants enrolled, 19.9% (95% CI, 14.9-24.9) acknowledged using antibiotics prior to their visit to the laboratory during the study period. On the contrary, 31.4% (95% CI, 25.7-37.5) of participants' urine samples were positive for antimicrobial activity. Participants within the age ranges of 20-30, 31-40 and 41-50 years had significantly lower odds of urine antimicrobial activity. Participants who had urine antimicrobial activity were more likely to have no growth on their culture plates than participants who had no urine antimicrobial activity [OR 2.39(1.37-4.18), p = 0.002]. The most commonly used antibiotics were the penicillins, fluoroquinolones and metronidazole. Although, majority of the participant (54.8%) had knowledge of antibiotics, most of them had inadequate information on their proper use. The commonest indications for antibiotic use were aches and pains (30.3%), diarrhoea (43.3%) and urinary tract infections (28.0%). Prior antibiotic use was found to increase the likelihood of obtaining a culture negative result and can affect the outcome of bacteriological tests.

AB Introduction
   Adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) are unwanted or unexpected health outcomes following vaccination, which may or may not be causally-linked to vaccines. AEFI reporting is important to post-marketing vaccine safety surveillance and has the potential to identify new or rare AEFIs, show increases in known AEFIs, and help to maintain public confidence in vaccine programs. Knowledge of the expected incidence (i.e. background rate) of a possible AEFI is essential to the investigation of vaccine safety signals. We selected three rarely reported AEFIs representing the spectrum of causal association with vaccines, from proven (immune thrombocytopenia [ITP]) to questioned (Kawasaki disease [KD]) to unsubstantiated (multiple sclerosis [MS]) and determined their background rates.
   Methods
   We extracted data on hospitalizations (CIHI Discharge Abstract Database) for ITP, KD, and MS among Ontario children for the period 2005 to 2014 from IntelliHEALTH. As ITP can be managed without hospitalization, we also extracted emergency department (ED) visits from the CIHI National Ambulatory Care Reporting System. For all conditions, we only counted the first visit and if the same child had both an ED visit and a hospitalization for ITP, only the hospitalization was included. We calculated rates by year, age group and sex using population estimates from 2005-2014, focusing on age groups within the Ontario immunization schedule around vaccine(s) of interest.
   Results
   Per 100,000 population, annual age-specific incidence of ITP in children age 1 to 7 years ranged from 8.9 to 12.2 and annual incidence of KD in children less than 5 years ranged from 19.1 to 32.1. Average annualized incidence of adolescent (11-17 years) MS across the study period was 0.8 per 100,000.
   Discussion
   Despite limitations, including lack of clinical validation, this study provides an example of how health administrative data can be used to determine background rates which may assist with interpretation of passive vaccine safety surveillance.

AB BackgroundMuscular dystrophies are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by variable degrees of progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. There is a wide variability in the age of onset, symptoms and rate of progression in subtypes of these disorders. Herein, we present the results of our study conducted to identify the pathogenic genetic variation involved in our patient affected by rigid spine muscular dystrophy.Case presentationA 14-year-old boy, product of a first-cousin marriage, was enrolled in our study with failure to thrive, fatigue, muscular dystrophy, generalized muscular atrophy, kyphoscoliosis, and flexion contracture of the knees and elbows. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was carried out on the DNA of the patient to investigate all coding regions and uncovered a novel, homozygous missense mutation in SEPN1 gene (c. 1379 C>T, p.Ser460Phe). This mutation has not been reported before in different public variant databases and also our database (BayanGene), so it is classified as a variation of unknown significance (VUS). Subsequently, it was confirmed that the novel variation was homozygous in our patient and heterozygous in his parents. Different bioinformatics tools showed the damaging effects of the variant on protein. Multiple sequence alignment using BLASTP on ExPASy and WebLogo, revealed the conservation of the mutated residue.ConclusionWe reported a novel homozygous mutation in SEPN1 gene that expands our understanding of rigid spine muscular dystrophy. Although bioinformatics analyses of results were in favor of the pathogenicity of the mutation, functional studies are needed to establish the pathogenicity of the variant.

AB BackgroundIn the wake of China's massive economic development, attention has only recently turned to the enormous treatment gap that exists for mental health problems. Our study is the first comprehensive, national examination of the levels and correlates of the public's ability to recognize mental illness in the community and suggest sources of help, setting a baseline to assess contemporary Chinese efforts.MethodsData were collected in China as part of the Stigma in Global Context - Mental Health Study (SGC-MHS) through face-to-face interviews using vignettes meeting clinical criteria for schizophrenia and major depression. Our analysis targets the Han Chinese participants (n=1812). Differences in the recognition of mental health problems were assessed using a chi-square test and further stratified by vignette illness type and urban vs. rural residence. Adjusted regression models estimated the effects of each predictor towards the endorsement three types of help-seeking: medical doctor, psychiatrist, and mental health professional.ResultsAs expected, recognition of mental health problems is low; it is better for depression and most accurate in urban areas. Perceived severity increases endorsement of the need for care and for treatment by all provider types. Recognition of a mental health problem specifically decreases endorsement of medical doctors while increasing recommendations for psychiatrists and mental health professionals. Neurobiological attributions decrease recommendations for mental health professionals as opposed to general or specialty physicians.ConclusionsContinued efforts are needed in China to promote mental illness recognition within rural areas, and of schizophrenia specifically. Promoting recognition of mental illness, while balancing the special challenges among individuals who understand the neurobiological roots of mental illness, may constitute a key strategy to reduce the sizeable mental health treatment gap in China.

AB BackgroundMost of patients with dementia are cared for by family members. Caring for people with dementia is challenging; approximately 30-55% of caregivers suffered from anxiety or depressive symptoms. A range of studies have shown that psychosocial interventions are effective and can improve caregivers' quality of life, reduce their care burden, and ease their anxiety or depressive symptoms. However, information on the acceptability of these interventions, despite being crucial, is under-reported.MethodsSystematic searches of databases were conducted for literature published on EMBASE, PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and PsycARTICLES until August 2017 and the searches were updated on June 2018. The selection criteria included primary studies with data about the acceptability of psychosocial interventions for informal caregivers and publications written in English. Two authors independently selected studies, extracted study characteristics and data, assessed the methodological quality of the included studies by using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Quality Assessment Tool and Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) Qualitative Research Checklist, and conducted a narrative synthesis of quantitative and qualitative data.ResultsA total of 10,610 abstracts were identified through systematic searches. Based on screening titles and abstracts, 207 papers were identified that met the criteria for full paper review, with 42 papers from 13 different countries meeting the inclusion criteria. We found high- and moderate-quality evidence showing psychosocial interventions were acceptable, with important benefits for caregivers. Facilitators of acceptability included caregivers' need for intervention, appropriate content and organization of the intervention, and knowledge and professionalism of the staff. Barriers to acceptability included participants' poor health status and low education levels, caregiving burden, change of intervention implementers, and poor system performance of interventions.ConclusionThere is preliminary evidence to support the acceptability of psychosocial interventions for dementia caregivers. However, the available supporting evidence is limited, and there is currently no adequate information from these studies indicating that the acceptability has received enough attention from researchers. More well-designed studies assessing psychosocial interventions are needed to give specific statements about acceptability, and the measure of acceptability with psychosocial interventions should be more comprehensive.

AB BackgroundGlobally, millions of children aged below 5years die every year and some of these deaths could have been prevented. Though a global problem, under-five mortality is also a major public health problem in Ghana with a rate of 60 deaths per 1000 live births. Identification of drivers of mortality among children aged below 5years is an important problem that needs to be addressed because it could help inform health policy and intervention strategies aimed at achieving the United Nations SDG Goal 3 target 2. The aim of this study is to develop a predictive model and to identify determinants of under-five mortality.MethodThe 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey data was used in this study. Analyses were conducted on 5884 children. The outcome variable is child survival status (alive or dead). Single level binary logistic and multilevel logistic regression models were employed to investigate determinants of under-five mortality. The fit of the model was checked using Variance Inflation Factor and Likelihood Ratio tests. The Receiver Operating Characteristic curve was used to assess the predictive ability of the models. A p-value<0.05 was used to declare statistical significance.ResultsThe study observed 289 (4.91%) deaths among children aged below 5years. The study produced a good predictive model and identified increase in number of total children ever born, number of births in last 5years, and mothers who did not intend to use contraceptive as critical risk factors that increase the odds of under-five mortality. Also, children who were born multiple and residing in certain geographical regions of Ghana is associated with increased odds of under-five mortality. Maternal education and being a female child decreased the odds of under-five mortality. No significant unobserved household-level variations in under-five mortality were found. The spatial map revealed regional differences in crude under-five mortality rate in the country.ConclusionThis study identified critical risk factors for under-five mortality and strongly highlights the need for family planning, improvement in maternal education and addressing regional disparities in child health which could help inform health policy and intervention strategies aimed at improving child survival.

TI Vaccination coverage in Lebanon following the Syrian crisis: results
   from the district-based immunization coverage evaluation survey 2016
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH

DT Article
DE Expanded Programme on immunization; Vaccination coverage; Coverage
   evaluation survey; Lebanon; Syrian refugees
AB BackgroundFollowing the Syrian crisis, a substantial influx of Syrian refugees into Lebanon posed new challenges to optimal vaccination coverage for all children residing in the country. In 2016, the district-based immunization coverage evaluation survey (CES) assessed routine immunization coverage at the district level in Lebanon among children aged 12-59months.MethodsA cross-sectional multistage cluster survey was conducted in all of Lebanon (with the exception of the Nabatieh district) using the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) methodology adapted to the local context. A survey questionnaire consisting of closed and open-ended questions concerning demographic information and the child's immunization status was administered to collect immunization status information.ResultsAmong surveyed children aged 12-59months, irrespective of nationality, vaccination coverage at the national level for any recommended last dose was below the targeted 95%. Generally, vaccination coverage levels increased with age and were higher among Lebanese than Syrian children. However, large variations were revealed when coverage rates were analyzed at the district level. Vaccination was significantly associated with nationality, age, mother's educational status and the place of vaccination. Common reasons for undervaccination included the child's illness at the time of vaccine administration, vaccination fees, lack of awareness or a doctor's advice not to vaccinate during campaigns.ConclusionsSubstantial variability exists in vaccination coverage among children aged 12-59months residing in different districts in Lebanon. Immunization coverage reached 90% or above only for the first doses of polio and pentavalent vaccines. A considerable dropout rate from the first dose of any vaccine is observed. Efforts to optimize coverage levels should include increased vaccination initiatives targeting both refugee children and children from vulnerable host communities, increased cooperation between public and private vaccine providers, improved training for vaccine providers to adhere to complete vaccine administration recommendations, and increased awareness among caregivers.

AB Human viral pathogens are a major public health threat. Reliable information that accurately describes and characterizes the global occurrence and transmission of human viruses is essential to support national and global priority setting, public health actions, and treatment decisions. However, large areas of the globe are currently without surveillance due to limited health care infrastructure and lack of international cooperation. We propose a novel surveillance strategy, using metagenomic analysis of toilet material from international air flights as a method for worldwide viral disease surveillance. The aim of this study was to design, implement, and evaluate a method for viral analysis of airplane toilet waste enabling simultaneous detection and quantification of a wide range of human viral pathogens. Toilet waste from 19 international airplanes was analyzed for viral content, using viral capture probes followed by high-throughput sequencing. Numerous human pathogens were detected including enteric and respiratory viruses. Several geographic trends were observed with samples originating from South Asia having significantly higher viral species richness as well as higher abundances of salivirus A, aichivirus A and enterovirus B, compared to samples originating from North Asia and North America. In addition, certain city specific trends were observed, including high numbers of rotaviruses in airplanes departing from Islamabad. Based on this study we believe that central sampling and analysis at international airports could be a useful supplement for global viral surveillance, valuable for outbreak detection and for guiding public health resources.

AB BackgroundED overcrowding represents a significant public health problem in developed countries. Frequent users of the emergency departments (FUEDs; reporting 5 or more ED visits in the past year) are often affected by medical, psychological, social, and substance use problems and account for a disproportionately high number of ED visits. Past research indicates that case management (CM) interventions are a promising way to reduce ED overcrowding and improve FUEDs' quality of life. There is, however, very limited knowledge about how to disseminate and implement this intervention on a large scale to diverse clinical settings, including community hospitals and non-academic centers. This paper describes the protocol of a research project aiming to implement a CM intervention tailored to FUEDs in the public hospitals with ED in the French-speaking region of Switzerland and evaluate both the implementation process and effectiveness of the CM intervention.MethodsThis research project uses a hybrid study design assessing both implementation and clinical outcomes. The implementation part of the study uses mixed methods a) to describe quantitatively and qualitatively factors that influence the implementation process, and b) to examine implementation effectiveness. The clinical part of the study uses a within-subject design (pre-post intervention) to evaluate participants' trajectories on clinical variables (e.g., quality of life, ED use) after receiving the CM intervention. We designed the study based on two implementation science frameworks. The Generic Implementation Framework guided the overall research protocol design, whereas the RE-AIM (reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation and maintenance) framework guided the implementation and effectiveness evaluations.DiscussionThis research project will contribute to implementation science by providing key insights into the processes of implementing CM into broader practice. This research project is also likely to have both clinical and public health implications.Trial registrationNCT03641274, Registered 20 August 2018.

AB BackgroundAdvances in genetics and genomics require that healthcare professionals manage and incorporate new technologies into the appropriate clinical practice. The aim of this study was to identify core competencies in genetics for non-geneticists, both physicians and non-physicians.MethodsWe performed a literature review by searching MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and ISI Web of Science databases to identify studies reporting competencies in genetics in terms of knowledge, attitudes and abilities for non-genetic healthcare professionals. Furthermore, we conducted a survey according to a modified Delphi method, involving genetics experts to evaluate the competencies to be included as items of the curricula.ResultsThree eligible documents were identified and 3 Delphi rounds were carried out to reach a consensus on the competencies to be incorporated in the curricula. With reference to the curriculum for physicians, 19 items were included in the knowledge domain, 3 in the attitudes and 10 in the abilities domain. We developed two different curricula for non-physicians: one specific for those working in genetic services (20 items in the knowledge domain, 3 in the attitudes and 12 in the abilities) and one for those not working in genetic services (10 items in the knowledge domain, 3 in the attitudes and 2 in the abilities).ConclusionsWe developed 3 curricula in genetics addressed to non-genetic healthcare professionals. They differ in the knowledge and abilities, while the attitudes are the same for all the healthcare professionals. Although some concerns about the generalizability of the findings could arise due to the Italian perspective, we envisage the curricula can be used for genetics educational programs in several contexts.

TI 'Feminization' of physician workforce in Bangladesh, underlying factors
   and implications for health system: Insights from a mixed-methods study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CANADIAN MEDICINE; EXPECTATIONS; EDUCATION; GENDER; WOMEN
AB Background
   Bangladesh is currently faced with an emerging scenario of increased number of female physicians in the health workforce which has health system implications. For a health system to attract and retain female physicians, information is needed regarding their motivation to choose medical profession, real-life challenges encountered in home and workplaces, propensity to choose a few particular specialties, and factors leading to drop-out from the system. This exploratory mixed-methods study attempted to fill-in this knowledge gap and help the policy makers in designing a gender-sensitive health system.
   Methods
   Three-hundred and fifteen final year female medical students from four purposively selected medical colleges of Dhaka city (two each from public and private colleges) were included in a quantitative survey using self-administered questionnaire. Besides, 31 in-depth interviews with female students, their parents, and in-service trainee physicians, and two focus group discussions with female students were conducted. Gender disaggregated data of physicians and admitted students were also collected. Data were analysed using Stata version 13 and thematic analysis method, as appropriate.
   Results
   During 2006-2015, the female physicians outnumbered their male peers (52% vs. 48%), which is also supported by student admission data during 2011-2016 from the sampled medical colleges, (67% in private compared to 52% in public). Majority of the female medical graduates specialized in Obstetrics and Gynaecology (96%). Social status (66%), respect for medical profession (91%), image of a 'noble profession' (91%), and prospects of helping common people (94%) were common motivating factors for them. Gender disparity in work, career and work environment especially in rural areas, and problems of work-home balance, were a few of the challenges mentioned which forced some of them to drop-out. Also, this scenario conditioned them to crowd into a few selected specialties, thereby constraining health system from delivering needed services.
   Conclusions
   Increasing number of female physicians in health workforce, outnumbering their male peers, is a fact of life for health system of Bangladesh. It's high time that policy makers pay attention to this and take appropriate remedial measures so that women can pursue their career in an enabling environment and serve the needs and priorities of the health system.

AB BackgroundMental health disorders among adolescents have emerged as a major public health issue in many low and middle-income countries, including India. There is a paucity of research on the determinants of psychological distress, particularly among the poorest girls in the poorest communities. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and correlates of different indicators of psychological distress among 13-14year old low caste girls in rural, south India.MethodsCross-sectional survey of 1191 low caste girls in two districts in north Karnataka, conducted as part of a cluster randomised-control trial. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis assessed correlates of different indicators of psychological distress.ResultsMore than one third of girls (35.1%) reported having no hope for the future. 6.9% reported feeling down, depressed or hopeless in the past 2weeks. 2.1% reported thinking they would be better off dead or of hurting themselves in some way in the past 2weeks. 1.6% reported sexual abuse, 8.0% rrecent eve teasing and 6.3% having no parental emotional support. Suicidal ideation was independently associated with sexual abuse (AOR 11.9 (3.0-47.0)) and a lack of parental emotional support (AOR 0.2 (0.1-0.5)). Feeling down, depressed or hopeless was independently associated with recent eve-teasing (AOR 2.9 (1.6-5.4)), a harassing or abusive school environment (AOR 3.9 (1.8-8.2)), being frequently absent (AOR 2.8 (1.5-5.5)) or having dropped out of school (AOR 2.1 (1.0-4.3)), and living in Vijayapura district (AOR 2.5 (1.6-4.1)). Having no hope for the future was independently associated with a range of factors, including recent eve-teasing (AOR 1.5 (1.0-2.4)), being engaged (AOR 2.9 (0.9-9.7)), not participating in groups (AOR 0.5 (0.4-0.6)) and a lack of emotional support (AOR 0.6 (0.4-0.7)).ConclusionsRather than being a time of optimism, a third of low caste girls in rural north, Karnataka have limited hope for the future, with some contemplating suicide. As well as having important development benefits, interventions that address the upstream structural and gender-norms based determinants of poor mental health, and provide adolescent services for girls who require treatment and support, should have important benefits for girls' psychological wellbeing.Trial registrationProspectively registered at ClinicalTrials.GovNCT01996241.

AB BackgroundUrban form interventions can result in positive and negative impacts on physical activity, social participation, and well-being, and inequities in these outcomes. Natural experiment studies can advance our understanding of causal effects and processes related to urban form interventions. The INTErventions, Research, and Action in Cities Team (INTERACT) is a pan-Canadian collaboration of interdisciplinary scientists, urban planners, and public health decision makers advancing research on the design of healthy and sustainable cities for all. Our objectives are to use natural experiment studies to deliver timely evidence about how urban form interventions influence health, and to develop methods and tools to facilitate such studies going forward.MethodsINTERACT will evaluate natural experiments in four Canadian cities: the Arbutus Greenway in Vancouver, British Columbia; the All Ages and Abilities Cycling Network in Victoria, BC; a new Bus Rapid Transit system in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan; and components of the Sustainable Development Plan 2016-2020 in Montreal, Quebec, a plan that includes urban form changes initiated by the city and approximately 230 partnering organizations. We will recruit a cohort of between 300 and 3000 adult participants, age 18 or older, in each city and collect data at three time points. Participants will complete health and activity space surveys and provide sensor-based location and physical activity data. We will conduct qualitative interviews with a subsample of participants in each city. Our analysis methods will combine machine learning methods for detecting transportation mode use and physical activity, use temporal Geographic Information Systems to quantify changes to urban intervention exposure, and apply analytic methods for natural experiment studies including interrupted time series analysis.DiscussionINTERACT aims to advance the evidence base on population health intervention research and address challenges related to big data, knowledge mobilization and engagement, ethics, and causality. We will collect similar to 100TB of sensor data from participants over 5years. We will address these challenges using interdisciplinary partnerships, training of highly qualified personnel, and modern methodologies for using sensor-based data.

AB BackgroundHepatitis B (HepB) is a major public health concern in Malaysia yet little is known about knowledge and awareness of this infection in the country. Such information is essential for designing effective intervention strategies for HepB prevention and control. The aim of this study was to characterize knowledge and awareness regarding HepB in Malaysia and to identify their associated sociodemographic determinants.MethodsA community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted between January and May 2016 in Selangor state of Malaysia. A two-stage cluster random sampling design was used and one adult member of selected households was interviewed face-to-face. Logistic regression was used to estimate the differences in knowledge and awareness between groups.ResultsA total of 764 households completed the interviews and were included in the final analysis. Only 36.9 and 38.8% of the participants had good knowledge and awareness, respectively. The factors associated with good knowledge were being in the 35-44year age group, Malay ethnicity, high educational attainment and high family income. Being Chinese, being older and having high educational attainment were determinants of having good awareness towards HepB. Participants who had good knowledge were 2.5 times more likely to also have good awareness (OR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.78-3.26, p<0.001).ConclusionsThis study reveals a low level of knowledge and awareness of HepB among households in Malaysia. This finding highlights the need to improve public knowledge and awareness through well-designed programs targeting vulnerable groups in order to reduce hepatitis B virus transmission and achieve the governmental target of eliminating viral hepatitis as a public health concern by 2030.

AB Today, one of the most important global public health challenges is represented by hepatitis C virus (HCV), which imposes relevant costs. Globally speaking, the median cost of HCV-related complications ranges from $280 for an uncomplicated hepatitis to $139,070 for a liver transplantation. There are effective therapies for HCV patients worldwide, which has increased the hope of improving the process of managing and curing these patients. The adherence of patients to the pharmacological treatment and the use of effective drugs in the management of HCV disease are of crucial importance for health policy- and decision-makers. Studies show that, globally, insurance coverage for patients with HCV is not adequate in that still many patients are not covered by insurance programs. This issue as well as the economic conditions of countries are very serious challenges for ensuring an effective treatment. The most important and greatest help currently available to ensure HCV treatment is to implement plans to reduce costs and support patients. Some studies have shown that the expansion of coverage by private payers seems able to generate positive spillover benefits to public insures. Insurers, in addition to maintaining and increasing their own interests, are trying to increase their social status as a sponsor of patients. In conclusion, HCV disease requires serious policies and affordable insurance coverage.

TI Research ethics oversight in Norway: structure, function, and challenges
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Ethics; Health services research; Clinical trials; Undergraduate
   research
AB BackgroundWhile the development and evaluation of clinical ethics services in Norway has been recognized internationally, the country's research ethics infrastructure at times may have been less well developed. In 2016, media interest in the controversial nature of some health services research and pilot studies highlighted gaps in the system with certain types of research having no clear mechanisms through which they may be given due independent consideration. It is not clear that new legislation, implemented in 2017, will address this problem.SummaryWe explore relevant law, committee scope, and the function of the system. We show that 1) Norwegian law provides for ethics assessment for all forms of health research; 2) regional RECs in Norway might not have always enforced this provision, considering some interventional health services research to be outside their remit; and 3) Norwegian law does not explicity provide for local/university RECs, meaning that, in practice, there may be no readily accessible mechanisms for the assessment of research that is excluded by regional RECs. This may include health services research, pilot studies, and undergraduate research. New 2017 legislation has no effect on this specifically but focuses on institutions regulating researcher activity. This may place researchers in the difficult situation of on one hand, needing to hold to recognized ethical standards, while on the other, not readily having access to independent committee scrutiny to facilitate consistent operation with these standards.ConclusionTo support researchers in Norway and to protect the public, it may be necessary either to widen the regional RECs' remit or to make legislative alterations that permit and do not discourage the existence of local RECs.

It has been significantly a cause for great economic loss in animal production.MethodologyA cross-sectional study was conducted from December 2014 to June 2016 on 315 cattle in selected areas of eastern Ethiopia, aiming to estimate the occurrence of bovine tuberculosis using comparative intradermal tuberculin skin test and assess cattle owners' awareness on its public health implication. Random sampling method was applied in order to select animals from farm/household and associated risk factors were recorded before purified protein derivative (PPD) injection. Forty three farm/household owners of tuberculin tested animals were interviewed using pre-tested structured questionnaires.ResultsThe overall prevalence of bovine tuberculosis was 20.3% (n=64) in dairy cattle at recommended cut off >4mm. From a total of 43 farms/households tested, 22 were positive; each farm exhibited at least one tuberculin positive reactor animal with a total herd level prevalence of 51.2%. The prevalence of bovine tuberculosis in individual animal level was significantly different (2=45.2; P-value=0.000) in different sites with a higher prevalence (50%) in Dire Dawa. Farming system, herd size and other risk factors were significantly (p<0.05) associated with bovine tuberculosis occurrence. Of the total interviewed farm owners, only 33% had the knowledge of or had heard about bovine tuberculosis and 23% respondents were aware of the zoonotic importance of the disease. More than 50% of the interviewees had shown their preference of raw milk consumption. Out of the total interviewed households, 3 (7%) farm workers had TB cases that had direct contact with the animals.ConclusionThe study showed bovine tuberculosis is highly prevalent. Associated risk factors contributed to the prevalence of the disease in cattle and its transmission. Moreover, the majority of cattle owners lack awareness about the disease and its public health significance. Awareness rising about the disease, its transmission and zoonotic implication is of great importance for reduction and control measures. Evidence of tuberculosis patient farm attendants calls also for further detail investigation.

AB BackgroundInfluenza is a global infectious disease with a large burden of illness and high healthcare costs. Those who experience greater burden of disease include younger and older people, and pregnant women. Although there are known age and sex susceptibilities, little is known about how the interaction of age and sex may affect a population's vulnerability to infection with different subtypes of influenza virus.MethodsLaboratory-confirmed cases of influenza notified between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2015 obtained from the Australian Government National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System Influenza Public Data Set were analysed by age, sex and virus subtype. Age standardised notification rates per 100,000 population were calculated separately for females and males and used to generate female-to-male ratios with 95% confidence intervals for influenza A and B, and for virus subtypes A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2).Results334,560 notifications for influenza A (all notifications), A(H1N1)pmd09, A(H3N2) and B subtypes from a total of 335,414 influenza notifications were analysed. Male notification rates were significantly higher for the 0 to 4years old age group regardless of virus type or subtype; and higher for those aged 0 to 14years and those 85years and older for influenza types A and B and subtype A(H1N1)pdm09. Female notification rates were significantly higher for A(H1N1)pdm09 in those aged 15 to 54years, for Type A and sub-type A(H3N2) in those aged 15 to 69years, and for Influenza B in those aged 20 to 74years.ConclusionsWe observed a female dominance in notification rates throughout the adult age groups, which could possibly be related to health seeking behaviours. However, differences in health seeking behaviours cannot explain the variations observed across virus subtypes in the particular age groups with higher female notifications. Depending on their age, females may be more susceptible to certain subtypes of influenza virus. These observations suggest that there is an interaction between age and sex on susceptibility to influenza infection which varies by the subtype of the virus. The inclusion of pregnancy and menopausal status in surveillance data may assist development of targeted public health approaches during the emergence of new subtypes of influenza virus. Targeted vaccination campaigns may need to take into consideration specific age and sex groups who have a greater susceptibility to influenza infection as well as those who experience a greater burden of illness.

AB BackgroundCanadian policies regarding the implementation and public coverage of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) are heterogeneous and shifting, with NIPT being publicly covered for high-risk pregnancies in some provinces, but not others. Such a diverse and evolving policy landscape provides fertile ground for examining the preferences of pregnant women, their partners, and health professionals regarding the implementation and coverage of NIPT by the public healthcare system, as well as the factors influencing their preferences, which is what the present study does.MethodsIn this paper, we report the results of three-large scale Canadian surveys, in which 882 pregnant women, 395 partners of pregnant women, and 184 healthcare professionals participated.ResultsThe paper focuses on preferences regarding how and when NIPT should be used, as well as the factors influencing these preferences, and how coverage for NIPT should be provided. These are correlated with respondents' levels of knowledge about Down syndrome and testing technologies and with their stated intended use of NIPT results.ConclusionSalient is the marked difference between the preferences of prospective parents and those of healthcare professionals, which has potential implications for Canadian policy regarding NIPT implementation and insurance coverage.

AB Micronutrient deficiency is one of the biggest public health concerns in Bangladesh. As per World Health Organisation (WHO) in the 2016 report, 40% women of reproductive age suffer from anaemia. According to the National Micronutrient Survey 2011-2012, 57% women suffer from zinc deficiency. The objective of the present study was to determine the effectiveness of fortified rice (FFR in addressing anaemia and zinc deficiency among vulnerable women. Baseline and endline surveys were conducted among female Vulnerable Group Development (VDG) beneficiaries in five districts in Bangladesh before and after 12 months of FFR distribution. The intervention group received 30 kg FFR; the control group received 30 kg non-FFR for every month from January 2013 to December 2013. The sample sizes were 870 women (435/group) at baseline and 800 (400/group) at endline. Difference-in-difference (DID) was estimated to measure the effect of FFR on anaemia and serum zinc. In the baseline survey, 39% of the FFR group and 34% of the non-FFR group had anaemia. At endline, 34% of women in the FFR group were anaemic compared to 40.7% in the non-FFR group. At endline, prevalence of anaemia was reduced in the FFR group by 4.8% but increased in the non-FFR group by 6.7%. The DID estimation showed the reduction in anaemia after 12 months of FFR consumption was significant (p = 0.035). The DID in mean haemoglobin level after 12 months of FFR consumption was also statistically significant (p = 0.002). Zinc deficiency decreased by 6% in the FFR group at endline, though the DID was not significant. Most of the respondents of the FFR group reported that they received their entitled rice on a regular basis however only half of the non-FFR respondents received every month in 12 months. Anaemia was significantly associated with not consuming fortified rice, geographical region, older age and heavy menstrual bleeding (P<0.05). FFR reduced anaemia and zinc deficiency prevalence. Replacement of regular rice with FFR in the VGD programme is recommended to reduce anaemia among vulnerable groups.

AB There is evidence that in southern US, leprosy is a zoonosis infecting wild Dasypus novemcinctus armadillos but the extent of this finding is unknown. This ecological study investigated leprosy in rural communities and in wild armadillos from the Brazilian Amazon. The study area was the Mamia Lake of Coari municipality, Amazonas State, Northern region, a hyper endemic leprosy area where residents live on subsistence farming, fishing and armadillo hunting and its meat intake are frequent. The leprosy survey was conducted in sixteen communities by a visiting team of specialists. Local partakers provided wild armadillos to investigate M. leprae infection. Volunteers had complete dermato-neurological examination by a dermatologist with expertise in leprosy diagnosis, suspect skin lesions were biopsied for histopathology (Hematoxylin-eosin/HE, Fite-Faraco/FF staining); slit skin smears were collected. Armadillos' tissue fragments (skins, spleens, livers, lymph nodes, adrenal glands, others) were prepared for histopathology (HE/FF) and for M. leprae repetitive element-RLEP-qPCR. Among 176 volunteers, six new indeterminate leprosy cases were identified (incidence = 3.4%). Suspect skin sections and slit skin smears were negative for bacilli. Twelve wild D. novemcinctus were investigated (48 specimens/96 slides) and histopathological features of M. leprae infection were not found, except for one skin presenting unspecific inflammatory infiltrate suggestive of indeterminate leprosy. Possible traumatic neuroma, granuloma with epithelioid and Langhans cells, foreign-body granuloma were also identified. Granulomatous/non-granulomatous dermatitides were periodic-acid-Schiff/PAS negative for fungus. M. leprae-RLEP-qPCR was negative in all armadillos' tissues; no bacillus was found in histopathology. Our survey in rural communities confirmed the high endemicity for leprosy while one armadillo was compatible with paucibacillary M. leprae infection. At least in the highly endemic rural area of Coari, in the Brazilian Amazon region where infectious sources from untreated multibacillary leprosy are abundant, M. leprae infected armadillos may not represent a major source of infection nor a significant public health concern.

TI Malaria knowledge and its associated factors among pregnant women
   attending antenatal clinic of Adis Zemen Hospital, North-western
   Ethiopia, 2018
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Introduction
   In Ethiopia, the burden of malaria during pregnancy remains a public health problem. Having a good malaria knowledge leads to practicing the prevention of malaria and seeking a health care. Researches regarding pregnant women's knowledge on malaria in Ethiopia is limited. So the aim of this study was to assess malaria knowledge and its associated factors among pregnant woman, 2018.
   Methods
   An institutional-basedcross-sectional study was conducted in Adis Zemen Hospital. Data were collected using pre-tested, an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire among 236 mothers. Women's knowledge on malaria was measured using six malariarelated questions (cause of malaria, mode of transmission, signs and symptoms, complication and prevention of malaria). The collected data were entered using Epidata version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were computed to identify predictor variables at 95% confidence interval. Variables having P value of < 0.05 were considered as predictor variables of malaria knowledge.
   Result
   A total of 235 pregnant women participated which makes the response rate 99.6%. One hundred seventy two pregnant women (73.2%) of mothers had good knowledge on malaria. Women who were from urban (AOR; 2.4: CI; 1.8, 5.7), had better family monthly income (AOR; 3.4: CI; 2.7, 3.8), attended education (AOR; 1.8: CI; 1.4, 3.5) were more knowledgeable.
   Conclusion and recommendation
   Majority of participants had good knowledge on malaria. Educational status, household monthly income and residence werepredictors of malaria knowledge. Increasing women's knowledge especially for those who are from rural, have no education, and have low monthly income is still needed.

   Using data from DATASUS, the public national healthcare database, absolute counts of diagnostic tests performed were calculated for each of the 5570 municipalities and mapped. Spatial error regression and geographic weighted regression models were used to describe the geographic variation in the association between ACS mortality, income, and access to diagnostic testing.
   From 2008 to 2014, a total of 4,653,884 cardiac diagnostic procedures were performed in Brazil, at a total cost of $271 million USD. The overall ACS mortality rate during this time period was 133.8 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants aged 20 to 79. The most commonly utilized test was the stress ECG (3,015,993), followed by catheterization (862,627), scintigraphy (669,969) and stress echocardiography (105,295). The majority of these procedures were conducted in large urban centers in more economically developed regions of the country. Increased access to testing and increased income were not uniformly associated with decreased ACS mortality, and tremendous geographic heterogeneity was observed in the relationship between these variables.
   Conclusions
   The majority of testing for ACS in Brazil is conducted at referral centers in developed urban settings. Stress ECG is the dominant testing modality in use. Increased access to diagnostic testing was not consistently associated with decreased ACS mortality across the country.

TI On the prevalence of racial discrimination in the United States
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID PERCEIVED DISCRIMINATION; HEALTH; RACE; EXPERIENCES; DISPARITIES
AB Boutwell, Nedelec, Winegard, Shackelford, Beaver, Vaughn, Barnes, & Wright (2017) published an article in this journal that interprets data from the Add Health dataset as showing that only one-quarter of individuals in the United States experience discrimination. In Study 1, we attempted to replicate Boutwell et al.'s findings using a more direct measure of discrimination. Using data from the Pew Research Center, we examined a large sample of American respondents (N = 3,716) and explored the prevalence of discrimination experiences among various racial groups. Our findings stand in contrast to Boutwell et al.'s estimates, revealing that between 50% and 75% of Black, Hispanic, and Asian respondents (depending on the group and analytic approach) reported discriminatory treatment. In Study 2, we explored whether question framing affected how participants responded to Boutwell's question about experiencing less respect and courtesy. Regardless of question framing, non-White participants reported more experiences than White participants. Further, there was an interaction of participant race and question framing such that when participants were asked about experiences of less respect or courtesy broadly, there were no differences between non-White participants and White participants, but when they were asked about experiences that were specifically race-based, non-White participants reported more experiences than White participants. The current research provides a counterweight to the claim that discrimination is not a prevalent feature of the lives of minority groups and the serious implications this claim poses for research and public policy.

TI Development and characteristics of the Provincial Overdose Cohort in
   British Columbia, Canada
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID OPIOID OVERDOSE; PUBLIC-HEALTH
AB Introduction
   British Columbia (BC), Canada declared a public health emergency in April 2016 for opioid overdose. Comprehensive data was needed to identify risk factors, inform interventions, and evaluate response actions. We describe the development of an overdose cohort, including linkage strategy, case definitions, and data governance model, and present the resulting characteristics, including data linkage yields and case overlap among data sources.
   Methods
   Overdose events from hospital admissions, physician visits, poison centre and ambulance calls, emergency department visits, and coroner's data were grouped into episodes if records were present in multiple sources. A minimum of five years of universal health care records (all prescription dispensations, fee-for-service physician billings, emergency department visits and hospitalizations) were appended for each individual. A 20% random sample of BC residents and a 1: 5 matched case-control set were generated. Consultation and prioritization ensured analysts worked to address questions to directly inform public health actions.
   Results
   10,456 individuals suffered 14,292 overdoses from January 1, 2015 to Nov 30, 2016. Only 28% of overdose events were found in more than one dataset with the unique contribution of cases highest from ambulance records (32%). Compared with fatal overdoses, non-fatal events more often involved females, younger individuals (20 to 29 years) and those 60 or older. In 78% of illegal drug deaths, there was no associated ambulance response. In the year prior to first recorded overdose, 60% of individuals had at least one ED visit, 31% at least one hospital admission, 80% at least one physician visit, and 87% had filled at least one prescription in a community pharmacy.
   Conclusion
   While resource-intensive to establish, a linked cohort is useful for characterizing the full extent of the epidemic, defining sub-populations at risk, and patterns of contact with the health system. Overdose studies in other jurisdictions should consider the inclusion of multiple data sources.

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SEXUALLY-TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS; INFERTILITY CARE; REPRODUCTIVE
   TECHNOLOGIES; ASSOCIATION; ACCESS; AGE; CONSEQUENCES; PREVALENCE;
   MANAGEMENT; PREGNANCY
AB Background
   There is paucity of data on risk factors for reduced fertility in low-income countries.
   Objective
   To investigate factors associated with fertility among women in rural north eastern Tanzania.
   Subjects and methods
   A cohort of 1248 non-pregnant women was followed with urine pregnancy testing every third month or more regularly if they reported a missed menstrual period. Pregnancy was confirmed with trans-abdominal ultrasound. Information regarding general health, socioeconomic status and obstetric-gynaecological history was collected. Factors associated with conceiving within 180 days were identified using multivariate logistic regression analyses.
   Results
   Among the 1248 women, 736 were followed for 180 days and 209 of these had an ultra-sound confirmed pregnancy. During the follow-up period, 169/736 women were diagnosed with urogenital infections, including suspected sexually transmitted or reproductive tract infections, urinary tract infection, and vaginal candidiasis. Urogenital infections were significantly associated with reduced odds of conceiving within 180 days (adjusted OR (AOR) 00.21, 95% CI 0.11-0.36). Being above 30 years of age was also negatively associated with odds of conceiving (AOR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26-0.77). In contrast, women who recently stopped using hormonal contraceptives (AOR 2.86, 95% CI 1.45-5.70) and women with low socioeconomic status (AOR 1.56, 95% CI 1.04-2.33) were significantly more likely to become pregnant within 180 days.
   Conclusion
   Urogenital infection seems to be a major health factor associated with reduced chances of conceiving. Considering the availability of effective treatment options for these diseases, public health authorities should increase awareness of diagnostic tools in settings with limited resources in order to improve fertility.

TI Prevalence and determinants of anti-tuberculosis treatment non-adherence
   in Ethiopia: A systematic review and meta-analysis
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Review
ID PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS PATIENTS; ADHERENCE; DOTS; DEFAULT; ZONE; CARE
AB Background
   Tuberculosis is a global public health problem. One of the overarching dilemmas and challenges facing most tuberculosis program is non-adherence to treatment. However, in Ethiopia there are few studies with variable and inconsistent findings regarding non-adherence to treatment for tuberculosis.
   Methods
   This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine the prevalence of non-adherence to tuberculosis treatment and its determinants in Ethiopia. Biomedical databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, HINARI, EMBASE and Cochrane Library were systematically and comprehensively searched. To estimate the pooled prevalence, studies reporting the prevalence of adherence or non-adherence to tuberculosis treatment and its determinants were included. Data were extracted using a standardized data extraction tool prepared in Microsoft Excel and transferred to STATA/se version-14 statistical software for further analyses. To assess heterogeneity, the Cochrane Q test statistics and I 2 test were performed. Since the included studies exhibited high heterogeneity, a random effects model meta-analysis was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of nonadherence to tuberculosis treatment. Finally, the association between determinant factors and non-adherence to tuberculosis treatment was assessed.
   Results
   The result of 13 studies revealed that the pooled prevalence of non-adherence to tuberculosis treatment in Ethiopia was found to be 21.29% (95% CI: 15.75, 26.68). In the subgroup analysis, the highest prevalence was observed in Southern Nations and Nationalities of Ethiopia, 23.61% (95% CI: 21.05, 26.17) whereas the lowest prevalence was observed in Amhara region, 10.0% (95% CI: 6.48, 13.17.0;). Forgetfulness (OR = 3.22, 95% CI = 2.28, 4.53), fear side effect of the drugs (OR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.37, 2.74), waiting time >= 1 hour during service (OR = 4.88, 95% CI = 3.44, 6.91) and feeling distance to health institution is long (OR = 5.35, 95% CI = 4.00, 7.16) were found to be determinants of non-adherence to tuberculosis treatment.
   Conclusion
   In this meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of non-adherence to tuberculosis treatment in Ethiopia was high. Forgetfulness, fear of side effect of the drugs, long waiting time (>= 1 hour) during service and feeling distance to health institution is long were the main risk factors for non-adherence to tuberculosis treatment in Ethiopia. Early monitoring of the side effects and other reasons which account for missing medication may increase medication adherence in patients with tuberculosis in Ethiopia.

TI Methods of sample size calculation in descriptive retrospective burden

SO BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
LA English

DE Pharmacoepidemiology; Epidemiology; Public health
ID RESOURCE UTILIZATION; PATTERNS; MODERATE; OUTCOMES
AB BackgroundObservational burden of illness studies are used in pharmacoepidemiology to address a variety of objectives, including contextualizing the current treatment setting, identifying important treatment gaps, and providing estimates to parameterize economic models. Methodologies such as retrospective chart review may be utilized in settings for which existing datasets are not available or do not include sufficient clinical detail. While specifying the number of charts to be extracted and/or determining whether the number that can feasibly extracted will be clinically meaningful is an important study design consideration, there is a lack of rigorous methods available for sample size calculation in this setting. The objective of this study was to develop recommended sample size calculations for use in such studies.MethodsCalculations for identifying the optimal feasible sample size calculations were derived, for studies characterizing treatment patterns and medical costs, based on the ability to comprehensively observe treatments and maximize precision of resulting 95% confidence intervals. For cost outcomes, if the standard deviation is not known, the coefficient of variation cv can be used as an alternative. A case study of a chart review of advanced melanoma (MELODY) was used to characterize plausible values for cv in a real-world example.ResultsAcross sample sizes, any treatment given with greater than 1% frequency has a high likelihood of being observed. For a sample of size 200, and a treatment given to 5% of the population, the precision of a 95% confidence interval (CI) is expected to be 0.03. For cost outcomes, for the median cv value observed in the MELODY study (0.72), a sample size of approximately 200 would be required to generate a 95% CI precise to within +/- 10% of the mean.Conclusion This study presents a formal guidance on sample size calculations for retrospective burden of illness studies. The approach presented here is methodologically rigorous and designed for practical application in real-world retrospective chart review studies.

AB BackgroundUganda is a low income country that continues to experience disease outbreaks caused by emerging and re-emerging diseases such as cholera, meningococcal meningitis, typhoid and viral haemorrhagic fevers. The Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy was adopted by WHO-AFRO in 1998 as a comprehensive strategy to improve disease surveillance and response in WHO Member States in Africa and was adopted in Uganda in 2000. To address persistent inconsistencies and inadequacies in the core and support functions of IDSR, Uganda initiated an IDSR revitalisation programme in 2012. The objective of this evaluation was to assess IDSR core and support functions after implementation of the revitalised IDSR programme.MethodsThe evaluation was a cross-sectional survey that employed mixed quantitative and qualitative methods. We assessed IDSR performance indicators, knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention and level of confidence in performing IDSR tasks among health workers who underwent IDSR training. Qualitative data was collected to guide the interpretation of quantitative findings and to establish a range of views related to IDSR implementation.ResultsBetween 2012 and 2016, there was an improvement in completeness of monthly reporting (69 to 100%) and weekly reporting (56 to 78%) and an improvement in timeliness of monthly reporting (59 to 93%) and weekly reporting (40 to 68%) at the national level. The annualised non-polio AFP rate increased from 2.8 in 2012 to 3.7 cases per 100,000 population<15years in 2016. The case fatality rate for cholera decreased from 3.2% in 2012 to 2.1% in 2016. All districts received IDSR feedback from the national level. Key IDSR programme challenges included inadequate numbers of trained staff, inadequate funding, irregular supervision and high turnover of trained staff. Recommendations to improve IDSR performance included: improving funding, incorporating IDSR training into pre-service curricula for health workers and strengthening support supervision.ConclusionThe revitalised IDSR programme in Uganda was associated with improvements in performance. However in 2016, the programme still faced significant challenges and some performance indicators were still below the target. It is important that the documented gains are consolidated and challenges are continuously identified and addressed as they emerge.

AB BackgroundEffective alcohol policy measures conflict with the interests of the alcohol industry. In this study we addressed how various alcohol industry actors in Norway have responded to research findings and police data relating to the possible impacts of changes in on-premise trading hours on violent offending.MethodsA content analysis of documents was undertaken. The documents comprised i) hearing statements from policy processes on on-premise trading hours at the national level, and in 15 Norwegian cities, and ii) newspaper articles and other media coverage of this topic in Norway.ResultsAlcohol industry actors employed a range of strategies to shape the use of evidence regarding on-premise trading hours and violence. Nationally, the relevance of the international research literature was questioned before the publication of an unfavourable national study which was criticized directly. This led to commissioned attacks on the findings, constructing what were claimed to be disagreements between experts, emphasis on the complexity of violence and the role of confounding variables, and deflecting attention to alternative interventions. The handling of evidence at the local level was importantly different, where different industry actors and forms of evidence, notably police data, were involved in debates.ConclusionAlcohol industry actors employed various strategies to shape perceptions and use of evidence to advance their interests. The particular strategies and arguments changed over time as new data and research became available, and also varied between the national and the local levels, and by categories of industry actors.

   OVERWEIGHT CHILDREN; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; SELF-HELP; MAINTENANCE; PROGRAM
AB Background
   Childhood overweight and obesity has emerged as a major public health threat worldwide with challenges in its management. This review assessed the effectiveness of interventions for childhood overweight and obesity.
   Methods
   A systematic literature search was conducted using CINAHL, EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO and SPORTDiscus databases to retrieve articles published from 1st January 2000 to 31st December 2017. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies comparing different strategies in managing overweight and obesity among schoolchildren (6 to 12 years of age) were included. The main outcomes of interest were reductions in weight related variables included anthropometry and body composition measurements. All variables were analysed using random effects meta-analyses.
   Results
   Fourteen studies were reviewed, 13 were RCTs and one was a quasi-experimental study. The risk of bias for randomisation was low risk for all of RCTs except for one, which was unclear. The risk of bias for randomisation was high for the quasi-experimental study. Most interventions incorporated lifestyle changes and behavioural strategies such as coping and problem solving skills with family involvement. The meta-analyses did not show significant effects of the intervention in reducing weight related outcomes when compared with controls.
   Conclusion
   Meta-analyses of the selected studies did not show significant effects of the interventions on weight related outcomes among overweight and obese schoolchildren when compared with controls. The role of interdisciplinary team approaches with family involvement using behaviour and lifestyle strategies to curb obesity among schoolchildren is important.

AB Background
   Attendees of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinics could also benefit from HPV vaccination. Healthcare providers' recommendation is the most effective published method in motivating HPV vaccination initiation. This study was to investigate practice of recommending HPV vaccination to attendees among healthcare providers (doctors and nurses) working in public STD clinics in Hong Kong, China.
   Method
   Participants were medical doctors, registered nurses and enrolled nurses working in all eight public STD clinics in Hong Kong. All of them (29 doctors and 82 nurses) were approached by telephone. A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to them. A total of 98 completed questionnaires were received (28 doctors and 70 nurses). The study was conducted during January to May, 2018. Using recommendation of HPV vaccination to any attendees in the last year as the dependent variable, univariate and multiple logistic regression models were fitted.
   Results
   In the last 12 months, 16.3% and 36.7% of the participants had recommended HPV vaccination to any male attendees and to any female attendees of their clinics; 41.8% had recommended it to either male or female attendees. Adjusting for significant background variables (professions and years of working experience in the clinic), three constructs of the Theory of Planned Behavior were significantly associated with the dependent variable in expected directions. They were: 1) the Positive Attitude Scale (adjusted odds ratios, AOR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.41), 2) the Negative Attitude Scale (AOR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.77, 0.94), and 3) the Perceived Behavioral Control Scale (AOR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.75).
   Conclusion
   STD clinics are ideal settings that allow healthcare providers to access individuals who are at high-risk of HPV infection and promote HPV vaccination. Health promotion targeting these healthcare providers is warranted to enhance their perceived importance of recommending HPV vaccination. Such promotion should modify their attitudes and perceived behavioral control related to recommending HPV vaccination to attendees.

ID GENDER
AB BackgroundThis study reviews the attitudes and behaviours in rural Nepalese society towards women with disabilities, their pregnancy, childbirth and motherhood. Society often perceives people with disabilities as different from the norm, and women with disabilities are frequently considered to be doubly discriminated against. Studies show that negative perceptions held in many societies undervalue women with disabilities and that there is discomfort with questions of their control over pregnancy, childbirth and motherhood, thus limiting their sexual and reproductive rights. Public attitudes towards women with disabilities have a significant impact on their life experiences, opportunities and help-seeking behaviours. Numerous studies in the global literature concentrate on attitudes towards persons with disabilities, however there have been few studies in Nepal and fewer still specifically on women.MethodsA qualitative approach, with six focus group discussions among Dalit and non-Dalit women without disabilities and female community health volunteers on their views and understandings about sexual and reproductive health among women with disabilities, and 17 face-to-face semi-structured interviews with women with physical and sensory disabilities who have had the experience of pregnancy and childbirth was conducted in Rupandehi district in 2015. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and translated into English before being analysed thematically.ResultsThe study found negative societal attitudes with misconceptions about disability based on negative stereotyping and a prejudiced social environment. Issues around the marriage of women with disabilities, their ability to conceive, give birth and safely raise a child were prime concerns identified by the non-disabled study participants. Moreover, many participants with and without disabilities reported anxieties and fears that a disabled woman's impairment, no matter what type of impairment, would be transmitted to her baby, Participants - both disabled and non-disabled, reported that pregnancy and childbirth of women with disabilities were often viewed as an additional burden for the family and society. Insufficient public knowledge about disability leading to inaccurate blanket assumptions resulted in discrimination, rejection, exclusion and violence against women with disabilities inside and outside their homes. Stigma, stereotyping and prejudice among non-disabled people resulted to exclusion, discrimination and rejection of women with disabilities. Myths, folklore and misconceptions in culture, tradition and religion about disability were found to be deeply rooted and often cited as the basis for individual beliefs and attitudes.ConclusionWomen with disabilities face significant challenges from family and society in every sphere of their reproductive lives including pregnancy, childbirth and motherhood. There is a need for social policy to raise public awareness and for improved advocacy to mitigate misconception about disability and promote disabled women's sexual and reproductive rights.

AB BackgroundThe literature has described several challenges related to the quality of diabetes management clinics in public primary health care centres in Oman. These clinics continue to face challenges due to the continuous growth of individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. We sought to explore the challenges faced in these clinics and discuss opportunities for improvement in Oman.MethodsThis qualitative study was designed to include non-participant observations of diabetic patients and care providers during service provision at diabetes management clinics, as well as semi-structured interviews with care providers, at five purposively selected public primary health care centres. Care providers included physicians, nurses, dieticians, health educators, pharmacists, an assistant pharmacist, a psychologist, and a medical orderly. The data were analysed using qualitative content analysis.ResultsThe study disclosed three different models of service delivery at diabetes management clinics, which, to varying degrees, face challenges related to health centre infrastructure, technical and pharmaceutical support, and care providers' interests, knowledge, and skills. Challenges related to the community were also found in terms of cultural beliefs, traditions, health awareness, and public transportation.ConclusionThe challenges encountered in diabetes management clinics fall within two contexts: health care centres and community. Although many challenges exist, opportunities for improvement are available. However, improvements in the quality of diabetic clinics in primary health care centres might take time and require extensive involvement, shared responsibilities, and implications from the government, health care centres, and community.

AB BackgroundRelatively little is known about which characteristics of smokers are related to choosing a specific type of smoking cessation service. The user characteristics of different smoking cessation services were compared to determine the service preferred by user characteristics.MethodsThe characteristics of adult smokers from Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (3762) and registered users of national smoking cessation services operated through the web (14,762), at Public Health Center-based Smoking Cessation Clinics (PHC-based SCCs) (335,532), and by telephone (Quitline) (2983) were compared.ResultsFemales and younger aged were more in web and telephone-based cessation service users, while aged 50years or older were more in PHC-based SCCs users. Although manufacturing and production workers were the most prevalent among smokers in the general population, office workers and others including housewives and unemployed were most prevalent among the users of Quitline and PHC-based SCCs, respectively. The number of cigarettes smoked per day was twice as high among cessation service users as in general population. Smokers with greater nicotine dependency were most prevalent in the web-based service. Overseas users were in the web-based cessation service.ConclusionIdentifying user-specific characteristics by the type of cessation services looks necessary to develop and offer appropriate cessation services.

AB BackgroundPatient centeredness is an important component of patient care and healthcare quality. Several scales exist to measure patient centeredness, and previous literature provides a critical appraisal of their measurement properties. However, limited knowledge exists regarding the content of the various scales in terms of what type of patient centeredness they represent and how they can be used for quality improvement. The aim of this study was to explore the measurement properties of patient centeredness scales and their content with a special focus on patient involvement, and assess whether and how they can be used for quality improvement.MethodsA systematic review of patient centeredness scales was conducted in Medline, CINAHL, Embase, and SCOPUS in April and May 2017. Inclusion criteria were limited to articles written in English published from 2005 to 2017. Eligible studies were critically appraised in terms of internal consistency and reliability, as well as their content, structural, and cross-cultural validity. Type of studies included were scale-development articles and validation studies of relevant scales, with healthcare personnel as respondents. We used directed content analysis to categorize the scales and items according to Tritter's conceptual framework for patient and public involvement.ResultsEleven scales reported in 22 articles were included. Most scales represented individual, indirect, and reactive patient involvement. Most scales included items that did not reflect patient centeredness directly, but rather organizational preconditions for patient centered practices. None of the scales included items explicitly reflecting the use of patient experiences of quality improvement.ConclusionsThere is a lack of patient centeredness scales focusing on direct and proactive involvement of patients in quality improvement. It would be useful to develop such instruments to further study the role of patient involvement in quality improvement in healthcare. Furthermore, they could be used as important tools in quality improvement interventions.

We reviewed records of all patients for whom a H. pylori serology test was requested. The Cochran-Armitage trend test and multiple regression models were used to explore seroprevalence trends and predictors of seropositivity respectively.ResultsWe included 451 records, 63.6% (n=287) were female. The mean age of the study population was 40.7years, and the overall H. pylori seroprevalence was 51.5% (95% CI: 47-56%). The use of recommended eradication regimen appears to be low and declining. On average, H. pylori seroprevalence declined by 6.8% annually (p<0.0001). Occupational status independently predicted seropositivity, with students having lower odds of being seropositive than employed persons (aOR=0.09, 95% CI: 0.02-0.49, p=0.016).ConclusionDespite decreasing trends, the seroprevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection is high in dyspeptic patients attending this primary care setting. Improving living standards and establishing national guidelines for eradication can possibly aid the control of this infection.

AB BackgroundHepatic clonorchiasis is one of the most prevalent food-borne parasitic diseases worldwide. Clonorchis sinensis, the pathogen, is the major parasitic trigger contributing to cholangitis, cholelithiasis, and even cholangiocarcinoma. Unfortunately, unspecific clinical manifestations of patients with hepatic clonorchiasis tend to mislead clinicians to neglect or misdiagnose them, following ignorance of appropriate therapy. Our case report may shed light on definite diagnosis of clonorchiasis with concomitant cholelithiasis, methodology for surgical drainage of the parasites, and postoperative anthelmintic therapy.Case presentationTwo patients with habit of eating infected raw or undercooked freshwater fish were hospitalized due to right upper quadrant pain and jaundice. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)/computed tomography (CT) detection indicated cholangiolithiasis and cholangiolithiasis with concurrent cholecystolithiasis, respectively. Fecal examinations were both negative for adult worms or eggs of parasites. However, adults of Clonrochis sinensis were detected within hepatobiliary tracts during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Postoperative drainage and anthelmintic therapy contributed to complete recovery with good prognosis.ConclusionsClonorchiasis provokes cholangiolithiasis and cholecystolithiasis. Standardized treatments for these gallstone patients with concomitant clonorchiasis include surgical removal of the calculus, postoperative T tubule drainage and anthelmintic therapy. Serological test or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approaches might be helpful for diagnosis of clonorchiasis when no eggs are found by stool microscopy. Public health promotion on ceasing to eat raw freshwater fish is essential for prevention and control of clonorchiasis.

AB BackgroundDuring 2015-2016 an outbreak of invasive meningococcal disease due to N. meningitidis serogroup C ST-11 (cc11) occurred in Tuscany, Italy. The outbreak affected mainly the age group 20-30years, men who have sex with men, and the area located between the cities of Firenze, Prato and Empoli, with discos and gay-venues associated-clusters. A cross-sectional-survey was conducted to assess the prevalence and risk factors for meningococcal-carriage, in order to address public health interventions.MethodsA convenience sample of people aged 11-45years provided oropharyngeal swab specimens and completed questionnaires on risk factors for meningococcal carriage during a 3months study-period, conducted either in the outbreak-area and in a control-area not affected by the outbreak (cities of Grosseto and Siena). Isolates were tested by culture plus polymerase chain reaction. Serogroup C meningococcal isolates were further characterized using multilocus sequence typing. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to estimate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) for meningococcal carriage.ResultsA total of 2285 oropharyngeal samples were collected. Overall, meningococcal carriage prevalence was 4.8% (n=110), with nonencapsulated meningococci most prevalent (2.3%; n=52). Among encapsulated meningococci, serogroup B was the most prevalent (1.8%; n=41), followed by serogroup Y (0.5%; n=11) and serogroup C (0.2%; n=4); one carrier of serogroup E and one of serogroup Z, were also found (0.04%). Three individuals from the city of Empoli were found to carry the outbreak strain, C:ST-11 (cc11); this city also had the highest serogroup C carriage prevalence (0.5%). At the multivariate analyses, risk factors for meningococcal carriage were: illicit-drugs consumption (AOR 6.30; p<0.01), active smoking (AOR 2.78; p=0.01), disco/clubs/parties attendance (AOR 2.06; p=0.04), being aged 20-30years (AOR 3.08; p<0.01), and have had same-sex intercourses (AOR 6.69; p<0.01).ConclusionsA low prevalence of meningococcal serogroup C carriage in an area affected by an outbreak due to the hypervirulent N. meningitidis serogroup C ST-11 (cc11) strain was found. The city of Empoli had the highest attack-rate during the outbreak and also the highest meningococcal serogroup C carriage-prevalence due to the outbreak-strain. Multivariate analyses underlined a convergence of risk factors, which partially confirmed those observed among meningococcal outbreak-cases, and that should be considered in targeted immunization campaigns.

TI Kenyan health stakeholder views on individual consent, general

AB BackgroundIncreasing adoption of electronic health records in hospitals provides new opportunities for patient data to support public health advances. Such learning healthcare models have generated ethical debate in high-income countries, including on the role of patient and public consent and engagement. Increasing use of electronic health records in low-middle income countries offers important potential to fast-track healthcare improvements in these settings, where a disproportionate burden of global morbidity occurs. Core ethical issues have been raised around the role and form of information sharing processes for learning healthcare systems, including individual consent and individual and public general notification processes, but little research has focused on this perspective in low-middle income countries.MethodsWe conducted a qualitative study on the role of information sharing and governance processes for inpatient data re-use, using in-depth interviews with 34 health stakeholders at two public hospitals on the Kenyan coast, including health managers, providers and researchers. Data were collected between March and July 2016 and analysed using a framework approach, with Nvivo 10 software to support data management.ResultsMost forms of clinical data re-use were seen as an important public health good. Individual consent and general notification processes were often argued as important, but contingent on interrelated influences of the type of data, use and secondary user. Underlying concerns were linked to issues of patient privacy and autonomy; perceived risks to trust in health systems; and fairness in how data would be used, particularly for non-public sector re-users. Support for engagement often turned on the anticipated outcomes of information-sharing processes, as building or undermining trust in healthcare systems.ConclusionsAs reported in high income countries, learning healthcare systems in low-middle counties may generate a core ethical tension between supporting a public good and respecting patient autonomy and privacy, with the maintenance of public trust acting as a core requirement. While more evidence is needed on patient and public perspectives on learning healthcare activities, greater collaboration between public health and research governance systems is likely to support the development of efficient and locally responsive learning healthcare activities in LMICs.

AB BackgroundKnowledge of HIV-1 molecular transmission clusters (MTCs) is important, especially in large-scale datasets, for designing prevention programmes and public health intervention strategies. We used a large-scale HIV-1 sequence dataset from nine European HIV cohorts and one Canadian, to identify MTCs and investigate factors associated with the probability of belonging to MTCs.MethodsTo identify MTCs, we applied maximum likelihood inferences on partial pol sequences from 8955 HIV-positive individuals linked to demographic and clinical data. MTCs were defined using two different criteria: clusters with bootstrap support >75% (phylogenetic confidence criterion) and clusters consisting of sequences from a specific region at a proportion of >75% (geographic criterion) compared to the total number of sequences within the network. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess factors associated with MTC clustering.ResultsAlthough 3700 (41%) sequences belonged to MTCs, proportions differed substantially by country and subtype, ranging from 7% among UK subtype C sequences to 63% among German subtype B sequences. The probability of belonging to an MTC was independently less likely for women than men (OR = 0.66; P < 0.001), older individuals (OR = 0.79 per 10-year increase in age; P < 0.001) and people of non-white ethnicity (OR = 0.44; P < 0.001 and OR = 0.70; P = 0.002 for black and other' versus white, respectively). It was also more likely among men who have sex with men (MSM) than other risk groups (OR = 0.62; P < 0.001 and OR = 0.69; P = 0.002 for people who inject drugs, and sex between men and women, respectively), subtype B (ORs 0.36-0.70 for A, C, CRF01 and CRF02 versus B; all P < 0.05), having a well-estimated date of seroconversion (OR = 1.44; P < 0.001), a later calendar year of sampling (ORs 2.01-2.61 for all post-2002 periods versus pre-2002; all P < 0.01), and being naive to antiretroviral therapy at sampling (OR = 1.19; P = 0.010).ConclusionsA high proportion (>40%) of individuals belonged to MTCs. Notably, the HIV epidemic dispersal appears to be driven by subtype B viruses spread within MSM networks. Expansion of regional epidemics seems mainly associated with recent MTCs, rather than the growth of older, established ones. This information is important for designing prevention and public health intervention strategies.

AB BackgroundViolence against intimate partners is a worldwide public health problem. Cognitive behavioural therapy delivered in a group format is widely used for the treatment of men's violent behaviour towards their female partners. A Cochrane review about the effectiveness of this therapy from 2011 revealed a lack of controlled studies. Our aim is to update the current evidence on the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural group therapy on men's violent behaviour towards their female partner.MethodsThe Cochrane Library, the Campbell Collaboration Social, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, CINAHL, SCOPUS, Embase, Open Grey, Grey Literature Report, and Sociological Abstracts were searched for studies investigating the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural group therapy on intimate partner violence published in the period of January 1, 2010, to February 12, 2018. Manual searches were also performed to identify randomized and non-randomized controlled trials. Data extraction was done in duplicate. The primary outcome was the reduction in violent behaviour, and secondary outcomes were physical health, mental health, quality of life, emotion regulation, and substance use. Study quality was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool and the Risk of Bias In Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions tool. A narrative summary was used to describe the review findings.ResultsWe identified six new studies that met the inclusion criteria: four randomized controlled trials and two non-randomized trials. Three of the randomized controlled trials found a reduction in intimate partner violence after treatment. The fourth randomized trial found that a subsample of responding partners reported a reduction in violence but no changes in the men's self-reported violence after treatment. No effect could be detected in the two non-randomized studies. Analysis of risk of bias revealed mixed results, indicating both strengths and weaknesses.LimitationsOnly a limited amount of studies which scored as low quality were available.ConclusionsThere is still insufficient evidence to confirm that cognitive behavioural group therapy for perpetrators of intimate partner violence has a positive effect. Future research should focus on randomized controlled studies distinguishing between convicted and non-convicted populations where violent behaviour is the primary outcome.Trial registrationCRD42016041493.

AB BackgroundSoil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections are major public health problems in poor and developing countries that require fecal contamination of the environment for transmission. The consumption of raw vegetables without proper washing is one of the main routes of intestinal parasite acquisition. Therefore, this study was designed to detect the prevalence of intestinal parasitic contamination in commonly consumed raw vegetables sold in three central open-air markets in Nakhon Si Thammarat province, southern Thailand.MethodsA total of 265 fresh vegetable samples consisting of peppermint, lettuce, coriander, leek, gotu kola, celery, Chinese cabbage, culantro, Thai basil, and Chinese morning glory were purchased from three central open-air markets in the Mueang, Thasala and Sichon districts from December 2016 to March 2017. Each sample was washed with physiological saline, shaken for 15min, and then allowed to sediment. Finally, sedimentation was performed via the sedimentation concentration technique and examined using light microscopy for the detection of pathogenic parasites.ResultsThe overall prevalence of parasitic contamination was 35.1% (93/265). The most predominant parasite was hookworms (42.9%), followed by Strongyloides stercoralis (10.6%), Trichuris trichiura (2.6%), Ascaris lumbricoides (2.6%), and Toxocara spp. (2.6%). The highest level of contamination was found in celery, with a prevalence rate of 63.3% (19/30), while the lowest contamination level was found in Chinese morning glory, with a prevalence rate of 2.0% (2/30). The prevalence of intestinal parasite contamination in Mueang district (51.5%) was significantly higher than that in Thasala district (17.9%) and Sichon district (30.6%) (P<0.001).ConclusionThe results of the present study demonstrate that consumption of vegetables with parasite contamination in this area represents a potential route for the transmission of parasitic infection, particularly hookworm infection. Therefore, it is necessary for health authorities to educate consumers about the proper washing of vegetables prior to consumption. Preventive methods such as wearing gloves and washing hands after handling vegetables should also be advocated to sellers who are at risk of acquiring STH infections via skin penetration.

AB Background
   Depression and obesity are two major conditions with both psychological and somatic burdens. Some data suggest strong connections between depression and obesity and more particularly associated prevalence of both disorders. However, little is known about the geographical distribution of these two diseases. This study aimed to determine if there is spatial overlap between obesity and depression using data from the entire French territory.
   Methods
   Data for 5,627 geographic codes for metropolitan France were collected from the two national hospital databases (PMSI-MCO and RIM-P) for the year 2016. We identified people who were depressed, obese or both registered in the two public medico-administrative databases, and we assessed their location. In addition, a multivariable analysis was performed in order to determine geographic interactions between obesity and depression after controlling for age, sex, environmental and socio-economic factors (social/material deprivation, urbanicity/rurality).
   Results
   1,045,682 people aged 18 years and older were identified. The mapping analysis showed several cold and hot regional clusters of coinciding obesity and depression. The multivariable analysis demonstrated significant geographic interactions, with an increasing probability of finding a high prevalence of obesity in regions with major depression (OR 1.29 95% CI 1.13-1.49, p = 0.0002) and an increased probability of finding a high prevalence of depression in regions with a high ration of obesity (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.15-1.52, p<0.0001).
   Conclusion
   Our study confirms the significant bidirectional relationships between obesity and depression at a group level. French geographic patterns reveal a partial overlap between obesity and depression, suggesting these two diseases can be included in a common approach. Further studies should be done to increase the understanding of this complex comorbidity.

AB Introduction
   In Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), community-based health insurance (CBHI) is the only voluntary insurance scheme; it typically targets self-employed people, most of whom reside in rural areas and are dependent on agricultural activities for subsistence. However, until very recently, the enrollment rate has fallen short and failed to reach a large percentage of the target group. To promote the CBHI scheme and increase demand, some supporting components should be considered for inclusion together with the health infrastructure component.
   Objectives
   This paper provides empirical evidence that the benefit package components of hypothetical CBHI schemes have causal effects on enrollment probabilities. Furthermore, we examine the distribution of willingness to pay (WTP) in response to policy changes based on a sample of 5,800 observations.
   Methods
   A randomized conjoint experiment is conducted in rural villages in Savannakhet Province, Lao PDR, to elicit stated preference data. Each respondent ranks three options-two hypothetical alternatives and the CBHI status quo scheme. The levels of seven attributes-insurance coverage for medical consultations, hospitalizations, traffic accidents, pharmaceuticals and transportation; premiums; and prepaid discounts-are randomly and simultaneously assigned to the two alternatives.
   Results
   The findings suggest that the average WTP is at least as large as 10.9% of the per capita income of those who live in rural areas, which is higher than the WTP for health insurance averaged across low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in the literature. The component of round-trip transportation insurance coverage has a significant effect on WTP distribution, particularly increasing the share of the highest bin.
   Conclusion
   Therefore, the low CBHI scheme enrollment rate in Lao PDR does not necessarily imply low demand among the targeted population, as the finding from the WTP analysis illustrates potential demand for the CBHI scheme. Specifically, if transportation is addressed, enrollment is likely to significantly increase.

ID ANTENATAL CARE; ATTENDANCE
AB BackgroundThe heart-breaking maternal and neonatal health indicators in Nigeria are not improving despite previous interventions, such as Health for all' and Millennium Development Goals. The unattained health-related goals/targets of previous interventions put the success of the new Sustainable Development Goals in doubt if the existing paradigm remains unchanged. Thus, mere branding of health policies without improving what constitutes the health system such as manpower capacity and quality as well as staff-patients ratio will be wasteful efforts. This issue of global public health concern provided an indication for describing the capacity of manpower and reasons for staff shortage in primary level of health that are providing maternity services to women and their new-borns in Nigeria.MethodsThis is an embedded mixed-methods study. Its quantitative strand collected data with the aid of a structured questionnaire from 127 health workers across the 21 purposively selected primary health care centres in five local government areas. Descriptive statistics were employed for analysis. The qualitative strand of the study collected data through in depth interviews from medical officers of health or their representatives. The tape recorded and transcribed data were thematically coded, while reporting was by direct quotes. The mixing of the data from both strands was done in the discussion section.ResultsTwenty-nine (22.8%) of the health workers were between ages 51-58; 111 (87.4%) were married, while 44 (34.6%) had worked for duration of 21-33years in service. Evidences of incompetence were observed among the health workers. A total of 92 (72.4%) had been performing episiotomies on women in labour. Similarly, 69.8% had been repairing vaginal traumas. Nine (7.1%) knew the necessary steps of controlling postpartum vaginal bleeding, while 115 (91.3%) of them had not been trained in Life-Saving Scheme and post-abortions care.ConclusionThe shortage of manpower, disproportional skilled/semi-skilled ratio, lack of framework for staff recruitment, staff incompetence and inappropriate childbirth practices show that women were not receiving quality maternal and neonatal cares at the maternity centres.

AB BackgroundAt a population level, the majority of alcohol-related harm is attributable to drinkers whose consumption exceeds recommended drinking levels, rather than those with severe alcohol dependency. Identification and Brief Advice (IBA) interventions offer a cost-effective approach for reducing this harm. Traditionally, IBA interventions have been delivered in healthcare settings and therefore contextual influences on their use in non-clinical settings are not well understood.MethodsQualitative face-to-face and telephone interviews with staff responsible for delivering a pilot IBA intervention across community settings in the UK. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Inductive thematic analysis was used to identify key issues and the constant comparison method was employed to compare barriers and facilitators to implementation across and within settings.ResultsA number of facilitators and barriers to delivery and implementation was identified across settings. These included familiarity with the customer base, working within public spaces, and assimilation of the intervention within existing role boundaries. Despite underlying concerns relating to the sensitive nature of the topic, most delivery staff felt their respective settings were appropriate for the delivery of the intervention and had proactively engaged members of the public with varying levels of risky drinking and readiness for behaviour change. Perceptions of actual or potential intervention success were conceptualised in relation to existing day-to-day role boundaries and responsibilities and the contexts in which they took place.ConclusionsFindings support the potential value of multi-setting community approaches to facilitate more inclusive engagement with IBA. By comparing experiences and views from staff responsible for delivering the intervention across different community settings, our findings provide insight into how intervention acceptability and success are framed across settings, and how the intervention is assimilated within everyday practice and role boundaries. This study also highlights key areas to be addressed when implementing IBAs in non-clinical community settings by staff with diverse levels of health-related knowledge, skills and support needs. Although essential, the need for adaptable training and delivery approaches across different setting types is likely to result in methodological challenges that need to be addressed when evaluating future interventions and setting-specific influences on behaviour change and health outcomes.

AB BackgroundHealthcare-associated infections have become a public health problem, creating a new burden on medical care in hospitals. The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria poses a difficult task for physicians, who have limited therapeutic options. The dissemination of pathogens depends on reservoirs, the different transmission pathways of the infectious agents and the factors favouring them. Contaminated environmental surfaces are an important potential reservoir for the transmission of many healthcare-associated pathogens. Pathogens can survive or persist in the environment for months and be a source of infection transmission when appropriate hygiene and disinfection procedures are inefficient. The aim of this study was to identify bacterial species from hospital surfaces in order to effectively prevent healthcare-associated infections.MethodsSamples were taken from surfaces at the University Hospital of Abomey-Calavi/So-Ava in South Benin (West Africa). To achieve the objective of this study, 160 swab samples of hospital surfaces were taken as recommended by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 14698-1). These samples were analysed in the bacteriology section of the National Laboratory for Biomedical Analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics 21 software. A Chi Square Test was used to test the association between the Results of culture samples and different care units.ResultsOf the 160 surface samples, 65% were positive for bacteria. The frequency of isolation was predominant in Paediatrics (87.5%). The positive samples were 64.2% Gram-positive bacteria and 35.8% of Gram-negative bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus predominated (27.3%), followed by Bacillus spp. (23.3%).The proportion of other microorganisms was negligible. S. aureus and Staphylococcus spp. were present in all care units. There was a statistically significant association between the Results of culture samples and different care units (2=12.732; p=0.048).ConclusionThe bacteria found on the surfaces of the University Hospital of Abomey-Calavi/So-Ava's care environment suggest a risk of healthcare-associated infections. Adequate hospital hygiene measures are required. Patient safety in this environment must become a training priority for all caregivers.

AB BackgroundThus far, studies on Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing organisms have only been reported in those with a history of foreign travel, and a specific Japanese KPC-producing isolate has not yet been reported.Case presentationWe describe a Japanese patient, with no history of travel to foreign countries, admitted due to aspiration pneumonia, and a KPC-producing isolate detected in his sputum. Fortunately, his pneumonia resolved. His close contacts did not have a history of foreign travel, and the isolate was not detected in other patients.ConclusionsThe potential for KPC-producing organisms to become endemic in Japan is currently of great concern.

AB BackgroundMany upper respiratory pathogens cause similar symptoms. In China, routine molecular tests for upper respiratory pathogens are not widely performed and antibiotics abuse in treating upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) is a major public health concern.MethodsWe performed qualitative real-time PCR tests to detect common upper respiratory tract pathogens including 9 viruses and 3 bacteria in 1221 nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with fever and influenza-like symptoms in a Chinese city. A quantitative real-time PCR was also performed to measure the bacterial density of the colonizing Streptococcus pneumoniae in these samples.ResultsWe found very diverse pathogens including 81.7% viruses, 11.6% bacteria and 6.7% mixed viruses and bacteria. S. pneumoniae colonization was found in 8.0% of the cases but most of them had low bacterial density (Mean=3.9 log cfu/ml). We also discovered an increase of S. pneumoniae colonization frequency (but not the density) in patients with detectable upper respiratory tract pathogens, in a pathogen variety-dependent manner.ConclusionsOur study provided strong evidence against empiric antibiotic use for treating URTIs, and highlighted a strong need for improving the diagnostic capacity for URTIs by using more molecular testing in China.

ID DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
AB BackgroundViolence against women is a major human rights and public health issue globally. The experience of violence affects women across Australia, including the large number of migrant and refugee women who permanently or temporarily resettle in the country. Many women who experience violence find it difficult to access support, and evidence suggests women who have resettled in Australia face additional barriers to violence-specific services. Previous research, however, indicates many migrant and refugee women experiencing violence have contact with, and may disclose violence to, settlement and multicultural services. There has been limited research documenting current knowledge of, and practices by, settlement and multicultural services in relation to violence. The MuSeS project will address this knowledge gap and identify strategies settlement and multicultural services can use to better support women experiencing violence.MethodsThis mixed methods research project will be conducted in six geographic communities across three Australian states: South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria. The different migration and resettlement patterns seen in these jurisdictions will enable generation of data relevant to settings across the country. The project has been designed in consultation with partner organisations from the settlement and multicultural service sector to ensure the research addresses their concerns and priorities. A mix of quantitative and qualitative methods will be used to generate rich data to inform strategies for settlement and multicultural services to better support women experiencing violence. These methods include an anonymous online survey of settlement and multicultural service providers to assess current knowledge, practices and professional development needs; in-depth interviews with settlement, multicultural and specialist (refugee) mental health service providers; in-depth interviews with refugee women; and focus group discussions with frontline workers and volunteers working with settlement and multicultural services.DiscussionFindings from this two-year research project will generate an in-depth understanding of the current and potential role of Australian settlement and multicultural services in supporting migrant and refugee women experiencing violence, and inform strategies to strengthen services' capacity to appropriately respond. Given the prevalence of violence against women globally, findings will be useful for services engaging with migrant and refugee populations around the world.

AB BackgroundAutomatic clinical text classification is a natural language processing (NLP) technology that unlocks information embedded in clinical narratives. Machine learning approaches have been shown to be effective for clinical text classification tasks. However, a successful machine learning model usually requires extensive human efforts to create labeled training data and conduct feature engineering. In this study, we propose a clinical text classification paradigm using weak supervision and deep representation to reduce thesehuman efforts.MethodsWe develop a rule-based NLP algorithm to automatically generate labels for the training data, and then use the pre-trained word embeddings as deep representation features for training machine learning models. Since machine learning is trained on labels generated by the automatic NLPalgorithm, this training process is called weak supervision. We evaluat the paradigm effectiveness on two institutional case studies at Mayo Clinic: smoking status classification and proximal femur (hip) fracture classification, and one case study using a public dataset: the i2b2 2006 smoking status classification shared task. We test four widely used machine learning models, namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLPNN), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), using this paradigm. Precision, recall, and F1 score are used as metrics to evaluate performance.ResultsCNN achieves the best performance in both institutional tasks (F1 score: 0.92 for Mayo Clinic smoking status classification and 0.97 for fracture classification). We show that word embeddings significantly outperform tf-idf and topic modeling features in the paradigm, and that CNN captures additional patterns from the weak supervision compared to the rule-based NLP algorithms. We also observe two drawbacks of the proposed paradigm that CNN is more sensitive to the size of training data, and that the proposed paradigm might not be effective for complex multiclass classification tasks.ConclusionThe proposed clinical text classification paradigm could reduce human efforts of labeled training data creation and feature engineering for applying machine learning to clinical text classification by leveraging weak supervision and deep representation. The experimental experiments have validated the effectiveness of paradigm by two institutional and one shared clinical text classification tasks.

AB BackgroundDental caries are a significant public health problem. It is a disease with multifactorial causes. In Sub-Sahara Africa, Ethiopia is one of the countries with a high record of dental caries. This study was to determine the risk factors affecting dental caries using both Bayesian and classical approaches.MethodsThe study design was a retrospective cohort study in the period of March 2009 to March 2013 dental caries patients Hawassa Haik Poly Higher Clinic. The Bayesian logistic regression procedure was adapted to make inference about the parameters of a logistic regression model. The purpose of this method was generating the posterior distribution of the unknown parameters given both the data and some prior density for the unknown parameters.ResultsFrom this study the prevalence of natural dental caries was 87% and non-natural dental caries were 13%. The age group of 18-25 was higher prevalence of dental caries than the other age groups. From Bayesian logistic regression, we found out that rural patients, do not clean their teeth, patients from SNNPR and age group 18-25 are statistically significant. The finding from the Bayesian statistics approach is getting popular in data analysis than classical statistics because the technique is more robust and precise.ConclusionsBayesian approach was found to be better than classical method as the value of the standard errors in Bayesian approaches is smaller than that of classical logistic regression. The Bayesian credible interval is smaller than the length of the confidence interval for all significant risk factors. Age, sex, place of residence, region and habit of cleaning teeth was found to have a significant effect on dental caries patients.

AB BackgroundPsychosocial issues are major determinants as well as consequences of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study sought to assess the prevalence and identify factors associated with depression among patients with cardiac disease in a public health institute in Trinidad and Tobago.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted with a convenience sample of 388 hospitalised, stable, adult patients with cardiac disease admitted in the only tertiary public health institute in South Trinidad. Patients were identified and interviewed 3 to 5days after admission using a questionnaire comprising questions on demographic, medical, and lifestyle issues and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).ResultsThe prevalence of clinically significant depression (PHQ-9>9) among hospitalised patients with cardiac disease was 40.0%. However, the prevalence of non-minimal depression (PHQ-95) in this study was 78.4%. It was greater among women (83.1%) than among men (72.9%). Non-minimal depression was associated with sex (p=0.015), employment status (p=0.007), hypertension (p=0.017), stressful life (p0.001), feelings of depression (p0.001), regular exercise (p0.001), and living alone (p=0.006). Age, ethnicity, education level, income, or religious affiliations were not associated (p>0.05) with depression. Participants diagnosed with depression commonly reported feeling tired (81.2%), having trouble sleeping (74.7%), and moving/speaking slowly (73.5%). Patients with self-claimed depression (past or current) were four times more likely to have depression and those with self-reported stress and loneliness were twice as likely to have depression. Employed patients and those who exercised regularly were approximately 50% less likely to have depression.ConclusionsClinical depression prevalence among hospitalised patients with cardiac disease was 40.0%. Approximately twice as many (78.4%) had non-minimal depression, with higher prevalence among women. Employment, sex, hypertension, stressful life, feelings of depression, regular exercise, and living alone were associated with non-minimal depression. Patients with self-claimed depression, stress, and those living alone had a much higher likelihood of having depression, while those who were employed and exercised regularly were approximately half as likely to have depression.

AB BackgroundThe prevalence of obesity has increased significantly worldwide within the last decade. As obesity is recognised as a contributing factor when developing various health threatening chronic diseases, prevention initiatives focusing on weight loss are becoming more important. Because of the time spent at the workplace, workplaces can be optimal arenas for weight loss programs and these programs have been effective to decrease body weight. Thus, reasons for engaging in weight loss interventions needs exploring, in order to engage more workplaces in weight loss interventions. Such information provides important knowledge that may help to inform decisions of municipalities, employers and other public health decision makers, when and if implementing weight loss interventions. The aim of this study was therefore to explore reasons for employee engagement in weight loss projects at the workplace and the incentives a municipality, a manager at a home-care centre, and a project manager have to launch such project.MethodsA stratified case study was conducted. A representative from the municipality, the manager at a home-care centre, the project manager of the weight loss intervention and six health-care workers were interviewed at the end of a one-year weight loss intervention at the workplace. Data were analysed using Systematic Text Condensation.ResultsAnalysis identified different views and considerations for engaging in a weight loss intervention at the workplace. For the representative of the municipality the possible economical gain of the project was in focus. The project manager and the manager of the home-care centre both reflected mainly on improvement of the healthcare workers health. For the project manager, achieving good scientific results was highlighted as well. However, the employees were influenced by several factors, such as their own health and weight loss, the pressure from the environment and their struggle for recognition.ConclusionsThis study concluded that if targeting the increasing worldwide obesity problem through workplace initiated weight loss programs, the sales pitch to managements and employers have to be tailored in order to increase the participation and the motivation for the initiative.Trial registrationClinicalTrial.gov: NCT01015716, registration data 14.12.2010 (Prospectively registered).

ID TOBACCO-CONTROL; CHALLENGE; TRENDS
AB BackgroundYouth smoking continues to be a significant global public health concern. To ensure healthier lives for youths, healthcare professionals need to increase awareness among the youth of the health risks and addictive nature of smoking, strengthen their ability to resist negative peer influence and curiosity, and help those who smoked to quit. The Smoke-free Teens Programme was launched in 2012 to equip youngsters with up-to-date information about smoking and global trends in tobacco control and to encourage them to play a pioneering role in tobacco control. This paper describes the process and outcomes of this programme for youths in Hong Kong.MethodsThe Smoke-free Teens Programme contained three major components: (i) a 2-day-1-night training camp; (ii) creative activities to promote smoke-free messages in schools and the community; and (iii) an award presentation ceremony to recognize the efforts of outstanding Smoke-free Teens in establishing a smoke-free culture. All secondary school students or teenagers aged 14 to 18years from secondary schools, youth centres and uniform groups were invited to join the programme. The outcome measures were changes in (1) knowledge about smoking hazards; (2) attitudes towards smoking, tobacco control, and smoking cessation; and (3) practices for promoting smoking cessation.ResultsA total of 856 teenagers were recruited during the study period (July 2014 to March 2017). The results showed statistically significant changes in participants' knowledge about smoking hazards, attitudes towards tobacco control, and practice for promoting smoking cessation.ConclusionsThe Smoke-free Teens Programme demonstrated effectiveness in equipping youngsters with up-to-date information about smoking and global trends in tobacco control and in encouraging them to play a pioneering role in tobacco control. The trained Smoke-free Teens not only promoted the smoke-free messages among their schoolmates, friends, and families, but also gathered community support for a smoke-free Hong Kong. The programme has been instrumental in fostering a new batch of Smoke-free Teens to advocate smoke-free culture and protect public health.Trial registrationClinicaltrials.gov ID NCT03291132 (retrospectively registered on September 19, 2017).

AB BackgroundIn recent years, there has been an increased awareness of antimicrobial resistance in both animals and humans, which has triggered concerns over non-judicious antimicrobial use. In the United States, antimicrobial use in food-producing animals for growth promotion or improved feed efficiency is perceived as non-judicious. To facilitate judicious antimicrobial use, the United States Food and Drug Administration implemented the Veterinary Feed Directive, effective from January 1, 2017. Interventions, such as the VFD, designed to ensure the judicious use of antimicrobials among cattle producers may be more effective if the factors that inform and influence producer AMU practices are addressed. The specific objectives of this study were to determine the following among Tennessee beef cattle producers: (1) the most common drivers for using antimicrobials, (2) the perceived alternatives to antimicrobials, (3) the knowledge and perceptions regarding antimicrobial resistance, and (4) the preferred avenues for receiving information on prudent antimicrobial use. A total of 5 focus group meetings with beef producers were conducted in East, Middle, and West Tennessee. Each focus group was video recorded and thematic analysis was performed using NVivo.ResultsThe factors that producers considered to drive antimicrobial use were the type of cattle operation, disease and animal welfare, economic factors, veterinarian consultation, producer's experience and peer support, Veterinary Feed Directive, and perceived drug efficacy. Vaccination, proper nutrition, and other good management practices were considered alternatives to antimicrobial use. To encourage vaccine use among small producers, participants suggested packaging vaccines into smaller quantities. Antimicrobial resistance was perceived to be a problem affecting animal and public health. Participants suggested additional education for cattle producers on the prudent use of antimicrobials as a measure for improving antimicrobial use. The veterinarian, producer associations and meetings, and county extension agents emerged as trusted avenues for channeling information on prudent antimicrobial use to cattle producers.ConclusionsSeveral factors drive antimicrobial use among cattle producers in Tennessee. Participants generally perceived their antimicrobial use to be discreet and only when necessary. More awareness of drivers for the development of antimicrobial resistance and continuing education on prudent antimicrobial use is needed for Tennessee beef producers.

DE Breast cancer screening; Awareness and pPractice
ID TRENDS
AB BackgroundBreast cancer is a global health problem being the most common cancer of women in both developed and under-developed countries. Public and individual awareness can play a vital role in the prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. However evidence is sparse on awareness and practice of breast cancer screening methods used among women of reproductive age in Ethiopia. The present study was designed to determine factors associated with breast cancer screening awareness and practices of women in Addis Ababa.MethodsA facility based cross-sectional study was conducted among women who came for maternal and child health care services to selected public health centers. The participants were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Following data collection, data entry and analysis was done using Epi-Info version 7and SPSS Version 21 respectively. Cross tabulation of each independent variable with the dependent variable with their 95% confidence interval was done and those variables associated at binary logistic regression with a significance level of 0.2 were entered into multiple logistic regression.ResultsAbout half (53%) of women have heard about breast cancer and 35.5% of women are aware of at least one breancer screening method. Among those who are informed about breast cancer screening, 97% indicated that screening improves the chance of survival. Among the common screening methods; self-breast examination, clinical-breast examination and mammographic examination were practiced by 24.3%, 7.6% and 3.8% of respondents, respectively. Women who had high level of income were about 3 times more likst caely to be aware about breast cancer screening methods, [AOR = 2.5; 95%CI (1.04--5.91)], while women who attended secondary and tertiary school were 2 and 4 times more likely to practice breast cancer screening methods [AOR = 2.46; 95% CI (1.12--5.38)] and [AOR = 4.00; 95% CI(1.48--10.86)] respectively.ConclusionThis study has showed that self-reported breast cancer screening coverage is low. About two-thirds of women had no information about breast cancer screening methods.

AB BackgroundCancer screening programs hold much potential for reducing the cervical cancer disease burden in developing countries. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of mobile health (mHealth) phone technology to improve management and follow-up of clients with cervical cancer precursor lesions.MethodsA sequential mixed methods design was employed for this study. Quantitative data was collected using a cross-sectional survey of 364 women eligible for a Pap smear at public sector health services in Cape Town, South Africa. Information was collected on socio-demographic status; cell phone ownership and patterns of use; knowledge of cervical cancer prevention; and interest in Pap smear results and appointment reminders via SMS-text messages. Descriptive statistics, crude bivariate comparisons and logistic regression models were employed to analyze survey results. Qualitative data was collected through 10 in-depth interviews with primary health care providers and managers involved in cervical cancer screening. Four focus group discussions with 27 women attending a tertiary level colposcopy clinic were also conducted. Themes related to loss of mobile phones, privacy and confidentiality, interest in receiving SMS-text messages, text language and clinic-based management of a SMS system are discussed. Thematic analyses of qualitative data complemented quantitative findings.ResultsPhone ownership amongst surveyed women was 98% with phones mostly used for calls and short message service (SMS) functions. Over half (58%) of women reported loss/theft of mobile phones. Overall, there was interest in SMS interventions for receiving Pap smear results and appointment reminders. Reasons for interest, articulated by both providers and clients, included convenience, cost and time-saving benefits and benefits of not taking time off work. However, concerns were expressed around confidentiality of SMS messages, loss/theft of mobile phones, receiving negative results via SMS and accessibility/clarity of language used to convey messages. Responsibility for the management of a clinic-based SMS system was also raised.ConclusionsResults indicated interest and potential for mHealth interventions in improving follow-up and management of clients with abnormal Pap smears. Health system and privacy issues will need to be addressed for mHealth to achieve this potential. Next steps include piloting of specific SMS messages to test feasibility and acceptability in this setting.

   ANALYSIS; SODIUM REDUCTION; PACKAGED FOOD; SATURATED FAT; QUALITY;
   PATTERNS; TAX
AB Background
   Traditional methods of dietary assessment have their limitations and commercial sources of food sales and purchase data are increasingly suggested as an additional source to measuring diet at the population level. However, the potential uses of food sales data are less well understood. The aim of this review is to establish how sales data on food and soft drink products from third-party companies have been used in public health nutrition research.
   Methods
   A search of five electronic databases was conducted in February-March 2018 for studies published in peer-reviewed journals that had used food sales or purchase data from a commercial company to analyse trends and patterns in food purchases or in the nutritional composition of foods. Study quality was evaluated using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Quality Assessment Tool for Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies.
   Results
   Of 2919 papers identified in the search, 68 were included. The selected studies used sales or purchase data from four companies: Euromonitor, GfK, Kantar and Nielsen. Sales and purchase data have been used to evaluate interventions, including the impact of the saturated fat tax in Denmark, the soft drink and junk food taxes in Mexico and supplemental nutrition programmes in the USA. They have also been used to identify trends in the nutrient composition of foods over time and patterns in food purchasing, including socio-demo-graphic variations in purchasing.
   Conclusion
   Food sales and purchase data are a valuable tool for public health nutrition researchers and their use has increased markedly in the last four years, despite the cost of access, the lack of transparency on data-collection methods and restrictions on publication. The availability of product and brand-level sales data means they are particularly useful for assessing how changes by individual food companies can impact on diet and public health.

DT Article
ID ANEMIA
AB Introduction
   Nutritional anemia is a major public health problem throughout the world, particularly in developing countries. Iron with folic acid supplementation (IFAS) is recommended to mitigate anemia and its resulting complications during pregnancy. There has been limited study on IFAS adherence of pregnant women in the study area. The aim of this study was to assess adherence to IFAS and its associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care service in Debre Tabor General Hospital, Ethiopia.
   Methods
   An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from January 9 to April 8, 2017, at Debre Tabor General Hospital. A total of 262 study participants were included and selected by systematic random sampling. The entire interviewed questionnaire was checked and entered into EpiData version 3.1 and then exported to SPSS version 20 for windows for analysis. IFAS adherence status was defined as, if pregnant mothers took 65% or more of the IFAS which is equivalent to taking IFAS at least 4 days a week during the 1-month period preceding the study. Regressions were fitted to identify independent predictors of IFAS adherence. A P-value of less than 0.05 was used to declare statistical significance.
   Results
   A total of 241 pregnant women were included (92% response rate), of which 107 (44%) were adherent to IFAS. Only 39% received IFAS counseling, and 52% had some knowledge of IFAS. Gravidity (AOR = 2.92 95% CI (1.61, 5.30)), gestational age at first ANC visit (AOR = 3.67, 95% CI (1.94, 6.97)), pregnant women who got advice about IFAS (AOR = 2.04, 95% CI (1.12, 3.75)), current anemia (AOR = 2.22, 95% CI (1.45, 4.29)), and had knowledge about IFAS (AOR = 3.27, 95% CI (1.80, 5.95)) were statistically associated with adherence to IFAS among pregnant women.
   Conclusion
   Overall, IFAS adherence among pregnant women was low. The associated factors with adherence of IFAS were counseling and knowledge, early ANC attendance, pregnancy history, and current anemia diagnosis. IFAS counseling by health workers was low but, when given, was associated with improved IFAS adherence. Health workers and health extension workers should consistently counsel on IFAS benefits during ANC visit, to improve IFAS adherence during the current and subsequent pregnancies.

AB Background
   It has been widely understood that well-trained doctors are crucial for a high-quality public health system and safe patient care. Thus, in 2011, China initiated its first national residency training program, called the China Standardized Training for Resident Doctor (C-STRD), for medical graduates to prepare qualified doctors for the medical care system with increasing demands. So far, no studies have specifically address the prevalence of stress and its determinants among residents enrolled in the C-STRD.
   Participants and methods
   The research is performed in two stages. In stage I, the authors conducted a pilot study and met 112 C-STRD residents in person. Based on the preliminary data, a revised questionnaire was adopted in stage II, during which the authors conducted a multi-institutional, cross-sectional survey of 340 participants from 11 hospitals in Shanghai in a self-administered manner.
   Results
   The results showed that C-STRD residents were overall under severe stress as their mean PSS score was 27.5 4.9, which was higher than the threshold of high stress (PSS = 20). Specifically, the PSS score for the residents with Bachelor (MB), Master (MM) and Doctoral of Medicine (MD) educational degree were 26.6 +/- 4.1, 27.8 +/- 3.5 and 27.1 +/- 5.2, respectively (P>0.05). Their stress was mainly associated with their financial income status and workload, as these two factors caused more severe burden than other listed stressors (P<0.05). Specially, the residents indicated that their montly payroll amout were as low as $590.2 +/- 127 while no benefit package and allowance were given. Surprisingly, wage arrears up to 5.3 month were reported by 36 (10%) participants. Workload survey showed the residents has high work intensity and inadequate rest. Since no stress management program was provided, the majority of residents tended to cope their stress with unhealthy strategies, such as mesmerizing in TV/computer (88.2%) and overeating (59.7%).
   Conclusion
   The C-STRD residents are at high risk of perceived stress. Although there was a difference in perception of stress for workload and career future among different educational degree owners, low financial income is the major stressor among all C-STRD residents. Unhealthy stress management strategies were adopted by all residents due to lack of appropriate stress-relieving intervention.

AB Research on patient and public involvement so far concentrates on defining involvement, describing its methods, and analyzing involvement practices in various individual research disciplines. There is little empirical data on the process of and aims for selecting (lay) PPI participants, and to what extend they can and should be representative of the population at large. To explore practices and perceptions on these issues and on future PPI conduct more generally, we sent an electronic survey to authors who published involvement activities as part of their studies in medical and social science journals. We identified such authors with a systematic search of five databases and applied descriptive statistics for analysis. Of those who returned the survey (n = 127 of 315; 40%), most had previously conducted involvement activities (73%). 45% reported more than one type of involvement, e.g. consultation and deliberation and participation (14%) and to have recruited more than one type of participant for their PPI activity (56%), e.g. 'lay publics' and 'expert publics' (33% of 71). Representativeness was often seen as a crucial objective when selecting PPI participants, while less than half found it very easy (9%) or rather easy (34%) to select participants. Many respondents considered achieving good representativeness difficult (52%) or very difficult (17%). They identified significant respective challenges and desired more guidance on various aspects of planning and conducting PPI (56%). 55% thought that the concept of "involvement" should be changed or improved. We conclude that recruiting lay people for PPI activities and deciding about and handling representativeness are controversial in current PPI practice, given the manifold challenges mentioned by the survey respondents. Our findings may inform further research particularly regarding the potentially many cases of unpublished PPI.

AB Introduction
   Chronic respiratory diseases in Tanzania are prevalent and a silent burden to the affected population, and healthcare system. We aimed to explore the availability of services and level of health facilities readiness to provide management of chronic respiratory diseases and its associated factors.
   Methods
   The current study is a secondary analysis of the 2014-2015 Tanzania Service Provision Assessment Survey data. Facilities were considered to have a high readiness to provide management of chronic respiratory diseases if they scored at least half (>50%) of the indicators listed in each of the three domains (staff training and guideline, equipment, and basic medicines) as identified by World Health Organization-Service Availability and Readiness Assessment manual. Descriptive, unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression analyses were performed. A Pvalue < 0.05 was taken to indicate statistical significance.
   Results
   Out of 723 facilities included in this analysis, approximately one-tenth had a high readiness to provide management of chronic respiratory diseases. Less than 10% of the facilities had at least one staff who received training for management of chronic respiratory diseases. In an adjusted model, privately owned facilities [AOR = 3.3; 95% CI, 1.5-7.5], hospitals [AOR = 11.6; 95% CI, 5.0-27.2], health centres [AOR = 5.0; 95% CI, 2.4-10.7], and performance of routine management meeting [AOR = 3.3; 95% CI, 1.4-7.8] were significantly associated with high readiness to provide management for chronic respiratory diseases.
   Conclusion
   Majority of Tanzanian health facilities have low readiness to provide management for chronic respiratory diseases. There is a need for the Tanzanian government to increase the availability of diagnostic equipment, medication, and to provide refresher training specifically in the lower-level and public health facilities for better management of chronic respiratory diseases and other non-communicable diseases.

TI Poor quality male latex condoms found in Dominican Republic: Quality
   assurance evaluation and public health impact
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Male condoms are important to prevent transmission of HIV (and other STIs) and unwanted pregnancies. Research was conducted to evaluate the quality of male condoms available in the Dominican Republic market based on preliminary concerns of suspect product. Based on international testing standards (ISO 4074 and ASTM D 3492-08), condoms were sampled across ten prominent brands within the market and evaluated for airburst pressure/volume, freedom from holes, visual defects, package seal integrity, packaging and marking, lubricant quantity, and dimensions. Five of the brands were found to have extensive quality problems, where holes were found in 5.7% to 17.5% of the condoms (depending on the brand). Between 5.1% and 30.5% of these condoms failed to meet the requirements for air burst properties, and violations in regulatory labeling where observed. Three additional brands were compliant for the other tests, but were found to have the same challenges with labeling violations as the previous five brands. Two brands were found to be fully compliant with all aspects of the evaluation. The level of defects observed in these samples would greatly increase the risk of HIV transmission (and other STIs) and unwanted pregnancies. When projected on the annual market of male condoms sold in the Dominican Republic (similar to 26 million), potentially over 1 million condoms could be estimated to adversely impact the health risk of the end-user. These results prompted action by the Dominican Republic regulatory authorities to investigate and remove poor quality product from the market. This research study emphasizes the need for continued vigilance towards increased regulatory and market surveillance efforts to better protect public health interests.

DE Norovirus; Gastroenteritis: Care homes; Outbreaks; Surveillance
ID NOROVIRUS; DISEASE
AB BackgroundOutbreaks of infectious gastroenteritis in care homes are common, with norovirus a frequent cause. In England there is no co-ordinated national surveillance system. We aimed to estimate the burden of these outbreaks.MethodsUsing a generalised linear mixed effects regression model we described the relationship between the observed number of care home outbreaks and covariates. Estimated model parameters were used to infer uplift in the number of outbreaks expected if all areas were subjected to enhanced surveillance. From this we then estimated the total burden of care home gastroenteritis outbreaks in this period.ResultsWe estimated a total of 14,146 care home gastroenteritis outbreaks in England during 2014-2016; this is 47% higher than the reported total and a rate of 32.4 outbreaks per 100 care homes per year. The median number of outbreaks from the model estimates was 31 (IQR 20-46) compared to 19 (IQR 12-34) reported from routine surveillance.ConclusionsThis estimated care home gastroenteritis burden in England indicates that current surveillance substantially underestimates the number of outbreaks, by almost half. Improving this surveillance could provide better epidemiological knowledge of the burden of norovirus to inform public health policy, particularly with the advent of norovirus vaccines.

   INFECTION; PREGNANCY; OUTCOMES
AB Background
   Congenital syphilis (CS) is a major cause of mortality in several countries, especially in Latin America and the Caribbean. This study aimed to analyze fetal and infant mortality of CS reported to the Health Information System in a State in Northeastern Brazil.
   Methods and results
   This was a cross-sectional study that analyzed the deaths of CS from 2010 to 2014 through the linkage of the Mortality Information System (SIM) and the Notifiable Diseases Information System (Sinan). The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23.0 was used to calculate the rates of Fetal, Perinatal, Neonatal (early and late), and Postneonatal Mortality. Simple linear regression was performed. Fisher's exact test or Pearson's chi-square test were used for comparison of proportions and Student's t-test was used for comparison of means.
   Of the 414 cases reported to the SIM as deaths possibly caused by CS, 44 (10.6%) presented CS as the underlying cause. From 2010 to 2014 the Infant Mortality Rate of CS was 16.3 per 100,000 live births (y = 0.65x + 14.33, R-2 = 0.2338, p = 0.003). There was an 89.4% underreporting of deaths. Perinatal deaths and fetal deaths of CS accounted for 87.7% and 73.9% of total deaths, respectively.
   Conclusions
   The results of the study revealed a significant Fetal and Infant Mortality rate of CS and demonstrated the importance of using the linkage method in studies that involve the analysis of secondary data obtained from mortality and disease reporting systems. The underreporting of CS as a cause of fetal and infant mortality leads to unawareness of the reality of deaths from this disease, hindering the development of public policies aimed at its prevention.

AB Background
   Sexual and physical abuse in childhood creates a great health burden including on mental and reproductive health. A possible link between child abuse and HIV infection has increasingly attracted attention. This paper investigated whether a history of child physical and sexual abuse is associated with HIV infection among adult women.
   Methods
   A cross sectional survey was conducted among 2042 postnatal women (mean age = 26y) attending six public primary health care clinics in Harare, Zimbabwe within 6 weeks post-delivery. Clinic records were reviewed for mother's antenatal HIV status. Participants were interviewed about childhood abuse including physical or sexual abuse before 15 years of age, forced first sex before 16, HIV risk factors such as age difference at first sex before age 16. Multivariate analyses assessed the associations between mother's HIV status and child physical and sexual abuse while controlling for confounding variables.
   Results
   More than one in four (26.6%) reported abuse before the age of 15: 14.6% physical abuse and 9.1% sexual abuse, 14.3% reported forced first sex and 9.0% first sex before 16 with someone 5+ years older. Fifteen percent of women tested HIV positive during the recent antenatal care visit. In multivariate analysis, childhood physical abuse (aOR 3.30 95% CI 1.58-6.90), sexual abuse (3.18 95% CI: 1.64-6.19), forced first sex (aOR 1.42, 95% CI: 1.00-2.02), and 5+ years age difference with first sex partner (aOR 1.66 95% CI 1.09-2.53) were independently associated with HIV infection.
   Conclusion
   This study highlights that child physical and/or sexual abuse may increase risk for HIV acquisition. Further research is needed to assess the pathways to HIV acquisition from childhood to adulthood. Prevention of child abuse must form part of the HIV prevention agenda in Sub-Saharan Africa.

AB Background: Globally, about 1.25 million people die annually from road trafficcollisions. Evidence from global safety report shows a decreasing trend of road traffic injury indeveloped countries while there is an increasing trend in many developing countriesincluding Ethiopia. This study is aimed at assessing factors affecting injury severity levels of road traffic collision victims referred to selected public hospitals in Addis Ababa based on the Haddon Matrix.
   Methods: Ahospital-based cross-sectional study designwas implemented to randomly select a total of 363 road traffic collision victims. The collected data was cleaned andentered into Epidata version 3.1 and exported to SPSS Version 21 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariate logisticregression models were used to examine the association between explanatory and outcome variables.
   Results: A total of 363 individual sustained road traffic injuries were included to the study. Theprevalence of severe injury among road traffic accident victims was 36.4%. The following variables were significantly associated with increased injury severity: motorbike rider or motorbike passenger without helmet, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 4.7(95% CI: 1.04-21.09); driving under the influence of alcohol, crude odds ratio (COR) 2.64(95% CI; 1.23-5.64); victim with multiple injuries, AOR 3.88(95% CI: 2.26-6.65); vehicle size, AOR 2.14(95% CI: 1.01-4.52); collision in dark lighting condition, AOR 1.93(95% CI: 1.01-3.65); collision in cross city/rural, AOR 1.95(95% CI: 1.18-3.24) and vehicle occupant travelling unrestrained on the back of a truck, AOR3.9 (95% CI: 1.18-12.080). On the other hand, victims extricated at the scene by health care professional, AOR 0.33(95% CI: 0.13-0.83); victims extricated at the scene by police AOR 0.47(95% CI: 0.24-0.94); strict traffic police control at the scene of the collision, AOR 0.49(95% CI: 0.27-0.88) were significantly associated with less severe injuries.
   Conclusions: Findings reported in this paper suggest the need forimmediate and pragmatic steps to be taken to curb the unnecessary loss of livesoccurring on the roads. In particular, there is urgent need to introduce road safety interventions.

AB BackgroundThis paper aims to demonstrate how systems modeling methodology of Group Model Building (GMD) can be applied for exploring and reaching consensus on non-communicable disease (NCD) management. This exercise was undertaken as a first step for developing a quantitative simulation model for generating credible estimates to make an investment case for the prevention and management of NCDs.MethodsStakeholder engagement was facilitated through the use of a Group Model Building (GMB) approach. This approach combines various techniques in order to gain a whole system perspective.ResultsA conceptual qualitative model framework that connects preventionvia risk factors reductionscreening and treatment of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) was developed with stakeholders that draws on stakeholders personal experiences, beliefs, and perceptions through a moderated interactions to gain in-depth understanding of NCDs management.ConclusionManaging NCDs in Cambodia will require concerted effort to tackle NCD risk factors, identifying individuals with NCDs through screening and providing adequate and affordable consistent care to improve health and outcomes of NCDs.

AB BackgroundVisceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease of public health relevance in Brazil. To prioritize disease control measures, the Secretaria de Vigilancia em Saude of Brazil's Ministry of Health (SVS/MH) uses retrospective human case counts from VL surveillance data to inform a municipality-based risk classification. In this study, we compared the underlying VL risk, using a spatiotemporal explicit Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM), with the risk classification currently in use by the Brazil's Ministry of Health. We aim to assess how well the current risk classes capture the underlying VL risk as modelled by the BHM.MethodsAnnual counts of human VL cases and the population at risk for all Brazil's 5564 municipalities between 2004 and 2014 were used to fit a relative risk BHM. We then computed the predicted counts and exceedence risk for each municipality and classified them into four categories to allow comparison with the four risk categories by the SVS/MH.ResultsMunicipalities identified as high-risk by the model partially agreed with the current risk classification by the SVS/MH. Our results suggest that counts of VL cases may suffice as general indicators of the underlying risk, but can underestimate risks, especially in areas with intense transmission.ConclusionAccording to our BHM the SVS/MH risk classification underestimated the risk in several municipalities with moderate to intense VL transmission. Newly identified high-risk areas should be further evaluated to identify potential risk factors and assess the needs for additional surveillance and mitigation efforts.

AB BackgroundOn 18th May 2017, State Ministry of Health of former Warrap State received a report from Tonj East County of an outbreak of acute watery diarrhoea and vomiting in Makuac payam. We conducted this investigation to confirm the causative organism and describe the epidemiology of the outbreak in order to support evidence-based control measures.MethodsWe defined a suspected case as a resident of Tonj East or Tonj North County with sudden onset of acute watery diarrhoea and vomiting between May 1 and October 15, 2017. A probable case was defined as a suspected case with a positive rapid test for Vibrio cholerae; a confirmed case was a probable case with a positive stool culture for V. cholerae. We conducted systematic case finding by visiting health facilities and villages in the affected payams. We reviewed patient records from 1 May 2017 to 15 October 2017, to identify suspected cholera case-patients. We conducted a descriptive epidemiologic study, examining the distribution of the cases. We computed the attack rates by age, sex, and payam of residence. Case fatality rate was calculated as the ratio of the total number of suspected cholera death to the total number of cholera case-patients. We conducted an oral cholera vaccination campaign after the peak of the outbreak to control and prevent the spread to other payams.ResultsWe identified 1451 suspected cholera cases between May and October 2017. Of these, 81% (21/26) had a positive rapid diagnostic test for V. cholerae; out of the 16 rectal swabs transported to the National Public Laboratory, 88% (14/16) were confirmed to be V. cholerae O1 serotype Inaba. The epidemic curve shows continuous common source outbreak with several peaks. The mean age of the case-patients was 24years (Range: 0.2-75y). The clinical presentations of the case-patients were consistent with cholera. Males had an attack rate of 9.9/10000. The highest attack rate was in 30y (14 per 10,000). Among the six payams affected, Makuac had the highest attack rate of 3/100. The case fatality rate (CFR) was 3.0% (44/1451). Paliang and Wunlit had an oral cholera vaccination coverage of 100%, while 4 payams had a vaccination coverage of <90%.ConclusionThis was a continuous common source cholera outbreak caused by V. cholerae 01 sero type Inaba. We recommended strengthening of the surveillance system to improve early detection and effective response.

AB BackgroundIncreasing awareness of the complexity of public health problems, including obesity, has led to growing interest in whole systems approaches (WSAs), defined as those that consider the multifactorial drivers of overweight and obesity, involve transformative co-ordinated action across a broad range of disciplines and stakeholders, operate across all levels of governance and throughout the life course. This paper reports a systematic review of WSAs targeting obesity and other complex public health and societal issues, such as healthy lifestyles for prevention of non-communicable disease.MethodsSeven electronic databases were searched from 1995 to 2018. Studies were included if there had been an effort to implement a WSA. Study selection was conducted by one reviewer with a random 20% double checked. Data extraction and validity assessment were undertaken by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Narrative synthesis was undertaken.ResultsSixty-five articles were included; 33 about obesity. Most examined multicomponent community approaches, and there was substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity. Nevertheless, a range of positive health outcomes were reported, with some evidence of whole systems thinking. Positive effects were seen on health behaviours, body mass index (BMI), parental and community awareness, community capacity building, nutrition and physical activity environments, underage drinking behaviour and health, safety and wellbeing of community members, self-efficacy, smoking and tobacco-related disease outcomes.Features of successful approaches reported in process evaluations included: full engagement of relevant partners and community; time to build relationships, trust and capacity; good governance; embedding within a broader policy context; local evaluation; finance.ConclusionsSystems approaches to tackle obesity can have some benefit, but evidence of how to operationalise a WSA to address public health problems is still in its infancy. Future research should: (a) develop an agreed definition of a WSA in relation to obesity, (b) look across multiple sectors to ensure consistency of language and definition, (c) include detailed descriptions of the approaches, and (d) include process and economic evaluations.

AB BackgroundCarbon-monoxide (CO) poisoning is a substantial cause of preventable mortality. In Turkey, no nationwide data are being collected nowadays. In our study, we aimed to assess the trend in deaths related to CO exposure in all provinces of Turkey in a 10-year period by using the records of a news agency which collects the news from the majority of the national newspapers, local newspapers and television channels.MethodsIn this study, 27,881 news items that were released between January 2008 to December 2017 which included keywords of poisoning and death or carbon monoxide and death were evaluated. 2667 non-fire related deaths were used in the final analyses.ResultsIn a 10-year period, the risk of CO-related death in Turkey was 0.35/100000. 1371 (51.4%) of the victims were male and the median age of the patients was 45years (range, 15days-108years). Most of the deaths occurred 50years of age. Stoves were the predominant source [n=2096 (78.6%)]. There was a stagnating trend of CO-related deaths. Most of the incidents occurred in winter. The Middle Anatolian region was of the highest risk in CO-related mortality.ConclusionsIn conclusion, CO poisoning is still a considerable public health concern in Turkey. Results of our study showed that stoves are still frequently being used and are the cause of death especially in rural areas with lower socioeconomic status. A better organized, nationwide surveillance and management approaches are needed to demonstrate the true burden CO related morbidity and mortality as well as its prevention in Turkey.

AB BackgroundSocioeconomic disadvantage is a fundamental cause of morbidity and mortality. One of the most important ways that governments buffer the adverse consequences of socioeconomic disadvantage is through the provision of social assistance. We conducted a systematic review of research examining the health impact of social assistance programs in high-income countries.MethodsWe systematically searched Embase, Medline, ProQuest, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to December 2017 for peer-reviewed studies published in English-language journals. We identified empirical patterns through a qualitative synthesis of the evidence. We also evaluated the empirical rigour of the selected literature.ResultsSeventeen studies met our inclusion criteria. Thirteen descriptive studies rated as weak (n=7), moderate (n=4), and strong (n=2) found that social assistance is associated with adverse health outcomes and that social assistance recipients exhibit worse health outcomes relative to non-recipients. Four experimental and quasi-experimental studies, all rated as strong (n=4), found that efforts to limit the receipt of social assistance or reduce its generosity (also known as welfare reform) were associated with adverse health trends.ConclusionsEvidence from the existing literature suggests that social assistance programs in high-income countries are failing to maintain the health of socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. These findings may in part reflect the influence of residual confounding due to unobserved characteristics that distinguish recipients from non-recipients. They may also indicate that the scope and generosity of existing programs are insufficient to offset the negative health consequences of severe socioeconomic disadvantage.

AB BackgroundHousehold food insecurity is a potent social determinant of health and health care costs in Canada, but understanding of the social and economic conditions that underlie households' vulnerability to food insecurity is limited.MethodsData from the 2011-12 Canadian Community Health Survey were used to determine predictors of household food insecurity among a nationally-representative sample of 120,909 households. Household food insecurity over the past 12months was assessed using the 18-item Household Food Security Survey Module. Households were classified as food secure or marginally, moderately, or severely food insecure based on the number of affirmative responses. Multivariable binary and multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to determine geographic and socio-demographic predictors of presence and severity of household food insecurity.ResultsThe prevalence of household food insecurity ranged from 11.8% in Ontario to 41.0% in Nunavut. After adjusting for socio-demographic factors, households' odds of food insecurity were lower in Quebec and higher in the Maritimes, territories, and Alberta, compared to Ontario. The adjusted odds of food insecurity were also higher among households reliant on social assistance, Employment Insurance or workers' compensation, those without a university degree, those with children under 18, unattached individuals, renters, and those with an Aboriginal respondent. Higher income, immigration, and reliance on seniors' income sources were protective against food insecurity. Living in Nunavut and relying on social assistance were the strongest predictors of severe food insecurity, but severity was also associated with income, education, household composition, Aboriginal status, immigration status, and place of residence. The relation between income and food insecurity status was graded, with every $1000 increase in income associated with 2% lower odds of marginal food insecurity, 4% lower odds of moderate food insecurity, and 5% lower odds of severe food insecurity.ConclusionsThe probability of household food insecurity in Canada and the severity of the experience depends on a household's province or territory of residence, income, main source of income, housing tenure, education, Aboriginal status, and household structure. Our findings highlight the intersection of household food insecurity with public policy decisions in Canada and the disproportionate burden of food insecurity among Indigenous peoples.

AB BackgroundThe post-disaster mental health crisis intervention (MHCI) system in China remains immature and unsystematic. We aim to report the perceptions of a large sample of MHCI workers and government administrators and provide recommendations for developing a national mental health disaster response management plan in China.MethodsAn in-depth qualitative study was conducted, collecting data from 20 focus-group discussions and 25 key stakeholder interviews. These recruited participants who had been involved in different types of disaster rescue across 7 provinces/cities where disasters have recently occurred. We used thematic analysis to analyze the data and relevant findings were extracted for policy recommendation.ResultsMental health workers' perspectives were examined in detailed according to four core themes: forms of organization, intervention pathway, intervention strategy and technique, and public health information. Post-disaster MHCI should be approached in teams that are integrated with emergency medicine systems, and be led by unified command management. All levels of local health and family planning commission should prepare post-disaster MHCI work plans and build response teams/emergency centres. Future training for MHCI workers should focus on: building a sense of trust within the team; clarifying each member's role; strengthening the screening, assessment and referrals training for psychological professionals; and providing psychological intervention training for Chinese psychiatrists. It is necessary to set up guiding principles for disaster research ethics, mental health rehabilitation and media interaction.ConclusionsThrough exploring and analyzing the perceptions of current disaster response mental health workers and government administrators, our findings provide essential recommendations for developing a national to county level post-disaster MHCI emergency management plan and can guide the formulation of relevant laws and regulation in China.

AB High blood pressure is a worldwide problem and major global health burden. Whether alone or combined with other metabolic diseases, high blood pressure increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. This study is a secondary data analysis from the National Health and Morbidity Survey 2015, a population-based study that was conducted nationwide in Malaysia using a multi-stage stratified cluster sampling design. A total of 15,738 adults >= 18-years-old were recruited into the study, which reports the prevalence of hypertension stages among adults in Malaysia using the JNC7 criteria and determinants of its severity. The overall prevalence of raised blood pressure was 66.8%, with 45.8% having prehypertension, 15.1% having Stage 1 hypertension, and 5.9% having Stage 2 hypertension. In the multivariate analysis, a higher likelihood of having prehypertension was observed among respondents with advancing age, males (OR = 2.74, 95% CI: 2.41-3.12), Malay ethnicity (OR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.02-1.44), lower socioeconomic status, and excessive weight. The factors associated with clinical hypertension (Stages 1 and 2) were older age, rural residency (Stage 1 OR = 1.22, Stage 2 OR = 1.28), Malay ethnicity (Stage 2 OR = 1.64), diabetes (Stage 2 OR = 1.47), hypercholesterolemia (Stage 1 OR = 1.34, Stage 2 OR = 1.82), being overweight (Stage 1 OR = 2.86, Stage 2 OR = 3.44), obesity (Stage 1 OR = 9.01, Stage 2 OR = 13.72), and lower socioeconomic status. Almost 70% of Malaysian adults are at a risk of elevated blood pressure. The highest prevalence was in the prehypertension group, which clearly predicts a future incurable burden of the disease. Public health awareness, campaigns through mass and social media, and intervention in the work place should be a priority to control this epidemic.

AB Background
   Cryptosporidium spp are important intestinal protozoan parasites that cause diarrhea in humans, domestic and wild animals. Its infection remains a main public health concern however, the epidemics in human being is still unclear, particularly in developing countries. There are several factors that may enhance the spreading of this parasite in human population especially in young children.
   Methodology
   A questionnaire was designed to obtain the demographic and clinical data from the participants. A total of 425 stool samples were collected from suspected children (aged 3-10 years) in different hospitals and villages. The initial screening was performed with modified Ziehl Neelsen (mZN) staining technique followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Several potential risk factors were also assessed through the obtained information from suspected individuals.
   Results
   Out of all 425 collected samples, 127 were observed positive by mZN with a prevalence of 29.88% (127/425). The 127 mZN positive samples together with 50 mZN negative samples were processed for molecular analysis through PCR assay. Among them, 71 out of 127 mZN positive samples and 4 out of 50 mZN negative samples were found positive by PCR. The molecular analysis showed that Cryptosporidium parvum was the main cause of infection in children. The results revealed that individuals exposed to diarrhea were more likely to be infected with Cryptosporidium infection while several environmental factors may also play a key role in spreading of this parasite.
   Conclusions/Significance of the study
   The current high prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection may be due to the lack of awareness and routine based testing in identification of this parasite in District Buner. Further studies are required to determine the importance of Cryptosporidium infection in this area as well as across the country and to find out the possible risk factors that may be associated with the occurrence of this protozoan. There is, however, an urgent need for laboratory based observational studies to develop a more dynamic estimate of the cryptosporidial disease burden in the region.

DT Article
ID ANEMIA
AB Nutritional deficiencies are a major problem among developing countries including Myanmar. They can occur in all age groups, but the impact is more severe among children age 6-23 months as this period is critical for child development, and irreversible damages can occur due to nutritional deficiencies. Proper infant and young child feeding practices are pivotal to tackle nutritional problems and to prevent irreversible consequences among children. To assess the current feeding practices and associations with nutritional status, we conducted a secondary data analysis using the 2015-16 Myanmar Demographic and Health Survey. Multiple logistic regression analysis was done adjusting for covariates and the results were presented by adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. A total of 1,222 children age 6-23 months were included in this analysis. Twenty percent were stunted and 43% were moderately anemic. Only 16% of children received a minimum acceptable diet, 25% received diverse food groups, 58% were fed with minimum meal frequency, 85% currently breastfed, and 59% consumed iron-rich foods. Breastfeeding reduced the odds of being stunted. Male sex, perceived small birth size, mother with short stature, and working mother were significant predictors of stunting. Iron-rich food consumption was inversely associated with moderate anemia. Male sex and maternal anemia were also significant predictors of moderate anemia. The study concluded that stunting and anemia among young children in Myanmar are major public health challenges that need urgent action. While further prospective research is needed to determine the effect of feeding practice on linear growth, interventions such as iron supplementation, and nutritional education programs according to the World Health Organization complementary feeding guidelines could help prevent stunting and childhood anemia and might reduce their prevalence in Myanmar.

AB Acarological surveys in areas outside the currently believed leading edge of the distribution of lone star ticks (Amblyomma americanum), coupled with recent reports of their identification in previously uninvaded areas in the public health literature, suggest that this species is more broadly distributed in North America than currently understood. Therefore, we evaluated the potential geographic extent under present and future conditions using ecological niche modeling approach based on museum records available for this species at the Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit (WRBU). The median prediction of a best fitting model indicated that lone star ticks are currently likely to be present in broader regions across the Eastern Seaboard as well as in the Upper Midwest, where this species could be expanding its range. Further northward and westward expansion of these ticks can be expected as a result of ongoing climate change, under both low- and high-emissions scenarios.

AB Epidemiological synergy between outbreaks of viruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, such as chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses, has resulted in coinfection of humans with multiple viruses. Despite the potential impact on public health, we know only little about the occurrence and consequences of such coinfections. Here, we review the impact of coinfection on clinical disease in humans, discuss the possibility for co-transmission from mosquito to human, and describe a role for modeling transmission dynamics at various levels of co-transmission. Solving the mystery of virus coinfections will reveal whether they should be viewed as a serious concern for public health.

AB Background Mosquito-borne virusessuch as Zika, chikungunya, dengue fever, and yellow fever, among othersare of global importance. Although vaccine development for prevention of mosquito-borne arbovirus infections has been a focus, mitigation strategies continue to rely on vector control. However, vector control has failed to prevent recent epidemics and arrest expanding geographic distribution of key arboviruses, such as dengue. As a consequence, there has been increasing necessity to further optimize current strategies within integrated approaches and advance development of alternative, innovative strategies for the control of mosquito-borne arboviruses.
   Methods and findings This review, intended as a general overview, is one of a series being generated by the Worldwide Insecticide resistance Network (WIN). The alternative strategies discussed reflect those that are currently under evaluation for public health value by the World Health Organization (WHO) and represent strategies of focus by globally recognized public health stakeholders as potential insecticide resistance (IR)-mitigating strategies. Conditions where these alternative strategies could offer greatest public health value in consideration of mitigating IR will be dependent on the anticipated mechanism of action. Arguably, the most pressing need for endorsement of the strategies described here will be the epidemiological evidence of a public health impact.
   Conclusions As the burden of mosquito-borne arboviruses, predominately those transmitted by Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus, continues to grow at a global scale, new vector-control tools and integrated strategies will be required to meet public health demands. Decisions regarding implementation of alternative strategies will depend on key ecoepidemiological parameters that each is intended to optimally impact toward driving down arbovirus transmission.
   Author summary International public health workers are challenged by the burden of arthropod-borne viral diseases, to include mosquito-borne arboviruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus due in part to lack of sustainable vector control and insecticide resistance (IR), as well as the inability to scale up and sustain existing interventions for prevention of urban epidemics. As a consequence, there has been increasing interest to advance the development of alternative methods. This review provides a general overview of alternative vector-control strategies under development for the control of arbovirus mosquito vectors and highlights how each could offer innovative public health value. Considerations to regulations, acceptance, and sustainability are also provided.

AB Background Infection of bones and joints remains one of the most commonly described complications of brucellosis in humans and is predominantly reported in all ages and sexes in high-risk regions, such as the Middle East, Asia, South and Central America, and Africa. We aimed to systematically review the literature and perform a meta-analysis to estimate the global prevalence of osteoarticular brucellosis (OAB).
   Methodology Major bibliographic databases were searched using keywords and suitable combinations. All studies reporting the incidence and clinical manifestations of osteoarticular brucellosis in humans, and demonstrated by two or more diagnostic methods (bacteriological, molecular, serological, and/or radiographic) were included. Random model was used, and statistical significance was set at 0.05%
   Principal findings A total of 56 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. There was an evidence of geographical variation in the prevalence of osteoarticular disease with estimates ranging from 27% in low-risk regions to 36% in high-risk regions. However, the difference was not significant. Thus, brucellosis patients have at least a 27% chance of developing osteoarticular disease.
   Conclusions The prevalence of OAB is not dependent on the endemicity of brucellosis in a particular region. Hence, further research should investigate the potential mechanisms of OAB, as well as the influence of age, gender, and other socioeconomic factor variations in its global prevalence, as this may provide insight into associated exposure risks and management of the disease.
   Author summary Brucellosis continues to be a global public health concern. It is caused by facultative, intracellular Brucella species. The most commonly described complication of brucellosis in humans is the infection of bones and joints, which is predominantly reported in all ages and sexes in high-risk regions, such as the Middle East, Asia, South and Central America, and Africa. In this current study, we systematically reviewed the literature and performed a meta-analysis to estimate the global prevalence of osteoarticular brucellosis. We demonstrated an evidence of geographical variation in the prevalence of osteoarticular brucellosis with estimates ranging from 27% in low-risk regions to 36% in high-risk regions. However, the difference was not significant. Therefore, the prevalence of osteoarticular brucellosis is not dependent on the endemicity of brucellosis in a particular region, and brucellosis patients have at least a 27% chance of developing osteoarticular disease.

AB Background Zoonotic pathogens respond to changes in host range and/or pathogen, vector and host ecology. Environmental changes (biodiversity, habitat changes, variability in climate), even at a local level, lead to variability in environmental pathogen dynamics and can facilitate their transmission from natural reservoirs to new susceptible hosts. Whilst the environmental dynamics of aquatic bacteria are directly linked to seasonal changes of their habitat they also rely on the ecological processes underpining their transmission. However data allowing the comparison of these ecological processes are lacking. Here we compared the environmental dynamics of generalist and vector-borne aquatic bacterial pathogens in the same unit of time and space, and across rural and urban habitats in French Guiana (South America).
   Principal findings Using Leptospira sp. and Mycobacterium ulcerans we performed an environmental survey that allowed the detection of both pathogens in urban vs. rural areas, and during rainy vs. dry weather conditions. All samples were subjected to qPCR amplifications of LipL32 (Leptospira sp.) and IS2404 and KR (M. ulcerans) genetic markers. We found (i) a greater presence of M. ulcerans in rural areas compared with Leptospira sp., (ii) that modified urban environments were more favourable to the establishment of both pathogens, (iii) that Leptospira sp. presence was enhanced during the rainy season and M. ulcerans during the dry period, and (iv) differences in the spatial distribution of both bacteria across urban sites, probably due to the mode of dissemination of each pathogen in the environment.
   Conclusions We propose that in French Guiana simplified and modified urban ecosystems might favour leptospirosis and Buruli ulcer emergence and transmission. Moreover, disease risk was also constrained by seasonality. We suggest that the prevention of aquatic bacterial disease emergence in impoverished urban areas of developing countries would benefit from seasonal diseases targeted surveys, which would maximise limited budgets from cash-strapped health agencies.
   Author summary Many emerging pathogens are zoonotic and transmit from their abiotic reservoir to wild animals, domesticated animals and humans. It is now well known that environmental changes lead to variability in their dynamics in the environment and contribute to changes in the infectious risk. Many aquatic bacteria are responsable for major public health concerns, and more importantly in developing countries where access to drinking-water and sanitation is often limited. Whilst their environmental dynamics are directly linked to seasonal changes of their habitat, they also rely on the ecological processes underpining their transmission, i.e. directly transmitted vs. vector-borne. However, few studies have compared such environmental dynamics despite the fact that it would help to better characterise the infectious risk in the environment, as well as to better monitor the emergence of infectious diseases. Our aim was to provide data on the prevalence of generalist vs. vector-borne aquatic bacterial pathogens in the environment that would further allow the comparison of their environmental dynamics in the same unit of time and space, and across rural and urban habitats. We showed that urbanization and seasonality are two important factors underlying Buruli ulcer and leptospirosis disease emergence in French Guiana (South America), and propose that the mode of transmission of such environmental pathogens might have a detrimental role in disseminating the infectious agent in the environment.

AB Background Up to 1.45 billion people currently suffer from soil transmitted helminth infection, with the largest burden occurring in Africa and Asia. Safe and cost effective deworming treatment exists, but there is a debate about mass distribution of this treatment in high prevalence settings. While the World Health Organization recommends mass administration of anthelmintic drugs for preschool and school-aged children in high (>20%) prevalence settings, and several long run follow up studies of an influential trial have suggested large benefits that persist over time, recent systematic reviews have called this recommendation into question.
   Methods and findings This paper analyzes the long-term impact of a cluster-randomized trial in eastern Uganda that provided mass deworming treatment to preschool aged children from 2000 to 2003 on the numeracy and literacy skills of children and young adults living in those villages in 2010-2015. This study uses numeracy and literacy data collected seven to twelve years after the end of the deworming trial in a randomly selected subset of communities from the original trial, by an education-focused survey that had no relationship to the deworming study. Building on an earlier working paper which used data from 2010 and 2011 survey rounds, this paper uses an additional four years of numeracy and literacy data (2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015). Aggregating data from all survey rounds, the difference between numeracy scores in treatment versus control communities is 0.07 standard deviations (SD) (95% CI -0.10, 0.24, p = 0.40), the difference in literacy scores is 0.05 SD (95% CI -0.16, 0.27, p = 0.62), and the difference in total scores is 0.07 SD (95% CI -0.11, 0.25, p = 0.44). There are significant differences in program impact by gender, with numeracy and literacy differentially positively affected for girls, and by age, with treatment effects larger for the primary school aged subsample. There are also significant treatment interactions for those living in households with more treatment-eligible children. There is no evidence of differential treatment effects on age at program eligibility or number of years of program eligibility.
   Conclusions Mass deworming of preschool aged children in high prevalence communities in Uganda resulted in no statistically significant gains in numeracy or literacy 7-12 years after program completion. Point estimates were positive but imprecise; the study lacked sufficient power to rule out substantial positive effects or more modest negative effects. However, there is suggestive evidence that deworming was relatively more beneficial for girls, primary school aged children, and children living in households with other treated children.
   Research approval As this analysis was conducted on secondary data which is publicly available, no research approval was sought or received. All individual records were anonymized by the data provider prior to public release.
   Author summary Mass deworming is recommended by the World Health Organization for health benefits to communities where soil-transmitted helminth infection is endemic. In addition to health benefits, several recent studies find long run educational or economic benefits for cohorts dewormed as children. In this paper, treatment and control communities which formed part of a cluster randomized deworming trial in eastern Uganda from 2000-2003 were surveyed from 2010-2015 to measure children's basic numeracy and literacy. We analyze this data to see if there are detectable improvements in basic academic skills among children in the dewormed communities. We find that mass deworming of preschool aged children in high prevalence communities in Uganda resulted in no statistically significant gains in numeracy or literacy 7-12 years after program completion. However, there is suggestive evidence that deworming is relatively more effective for girls, primary school aged children, and children living in households with other treatment-eligible children.

ID POSTMORTEM DIAGNOSIS; TITRATION; DISEASE; ELISA; IGG; PCR
AB Background Early ante-mortem laboratory confirmation of human rabies is essential to aid patient management and institute public health measures. Few studies have highlighted the diagnostic value of antibody detection in CSF/serum in rabies, and its utility is usually undermined owing to the late seroconversion and short survival in infected patients. This study was undertaken to examine the ante-mortem diagnostic utility and prognostic value of antibody detection by rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum samples received from clinically suspected human rabies cases from January 2015 to December 2017.
   Methodology/Principal findings Samples collected ante-mortem and post-mortem from 130 and 6 patients with clinically suspected rabies respectively, were received in the laboratory during the study period. Ante-mortem laboratory confirmation was achieved in 55/130 (42.3%) cases. Real time PCR for detection of viral nucleic acid performed on saliva, nuchal skin, brain tissue and CSF samples could confirm the diagnosis in 15 (27.2%) of the 55 laboratory confirmed cases. Ante-mortem diagnosis could be achieved by RFFIT (in CSF and/or serum) in 45 (34.6%) of the 130 clinically suspected cases, accounting for 81.8% of the total 55 laboratory confirmed cases. The sensitivity of CSF RFFIT increased with the day of sample collection (post-onset of symptoms) and was found to be 100% after 12 days of illness. Patients who had received prior vaccination had an increased probability of a positive RFFIT and negative PCR result. Patients who were positive by RFFIT alone at initial diagnosis had longer survival (albeit with neurological sequelae) than patients who were positive by PCR alone or both RFFIT and PCR.
   Conclusions/Significance Detection of antibodies in the CSF/serum is a valuable ante-mortem diagnostic tool in human rabies, especially in patients who survive beyond a week. It was also found to have a limited role as a prognostic marker to predict outcomes in patients.
   Author summary Ante-mortem diagnosis of human rabies is essential for patient management and public health measures. The detection of virus specific antibodies in the CSF/serum of patients with suspected rabies is thought to have a limited diagnostic role owing to late seroconversion and short survival in rabies. We examined the diagnostic and prognostic utility of antibody detection by rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT) in CSF/serum samples received from clinically suspected human rabies cases (2015-2017). RFFIT (in CSF and/or serum) could confirm ante-mortem diagnosis in 45 (34.6%) of the 130 clinically suspected cases, accounting for 81.8% of the total 55 laboratory confirmed cases. The sensitivity of CSF RFFIT increased with the day of sample collection (post-onset of symptoms) and was found to be 100% after 12 days of illness. Patients who had received prior vaccination had an increased likelihood of a positive RFFIT and negative PCR result. Patients who were positive by RFFIT alone at initial diagnosis had longer duration of survival, although with poor functional outcomes. Antibody detection by RFFIT in CSF/serum was found to have a diagnostic utility especially in patients who survived beyond a week and a limited prognostic role in human rabies.

AB Yellow fever virus (YFV) is a member of the Flaviviridae family. In Brazil, yellow fever (YF) cases have increased dramatically in sylvatic areas neighboring urban zones in the last few years. Because of the high lethality rates associated with infection and absence of any antiviral treatments, it is essential to identify therapeutic options to respond to YFV outbreaks. Repurposing of clinically approved drugs represents the fastest alternative to discover antivirals for public health emergencies. Other Flaviviruses, such as Zika (ZIKV) and dengue (DENV) viruses, are susceptible to sofosbuvir, a clinically approved drug against hepatitis C virus (HCV). Our data showed that sofosbuvir docks onto YFV RNA polymerase using conserved amino acid residues for nucleotide binding. This drug inhibited the replication of both vaccine and wild-type strains of YFV on human hepatoma cells, with EC50 values around 5 M. Sofosbuvir protected YFV-infected neonatal Swiss mice and adult type I interferon receptor knockout mice (A129(-/-)) from mortality and weight loss. Because of its safety profile in humans and significant antiviral effects in vitro and in mice, Sofosbuvir may represent a novel therapeutic option for the treatment of YF. Key-words: Yellow fever virus; Yellow fever, antiviral; sofosbuvir
   Author summary Yellow fever virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and its infection may be asymptomatic or lead to a wide clinical spectrum ranging from a mild febrile illness to a potentially lethal viral hemorrhagic fever characterized by liver damage. Although a yellow fever vaccine is available, low coverage allows 80,000-200,000 cases and 30,000-60,000 deaths annually worldwide. There are no specific therapy and treatment relies on supportive care, reinforcing an urgent need for antiviral repourposing. Here, we showed that sofosbuvir, clinically approved against hepatitis C, inhibits yellow fever virus replication in liver cell lines and animal models. In vitro, sofosbuvir inhibits viral RNA replication, decreases the number of infected cells and the production of infectious virus particles. These data is particularly relevante since the liver is the main target of yellow fever infection. Sofosbuvir also protected infected animals from mortality, weight loss and liver injury, especially prophylatically. Our pre-clinical results supports a second use of sofosbuvir against yellow fever.

TI Probabilistic logic analysis of the highly heterogeneous spatiotemporal
   HFRS incidence distribution in Heilongjiang province (China) during
   2005-2013
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES

AB Background Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a zoonosis caused by hantavirus (belongs to Hantaviridae family). A large amount of HFRS cases occur in China, especially in the Heilongjiang Province, raising great concerns regarding public health. The distribution of these cases across space-time often exhibits highly heterogeneous characteristics. Hence, it is widely recognized that the improved mapping of heterogeneous HFRS distributions and the quantitative assessment of the space-time disease transition patterns can advance considerably the detection, prevention and control of epidemic outbreaks.
   Methods A synthesis of space-time mapping and probabilistic logic is proposed to study the distribution of monthly HFRS population-standardized incidences in Heilongjiang province during the period 2005-2013. We introduce a class-dependent Bayesian maximum entropy (cd-BME) mapping method dividing the original dataset into discrete incidence classes that overcome data heterogeneity and skewness effects and can produce space-time HFRS incidence estimates together with their estimation accuracy. A ten-fold cross validation analysis is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed cd-BME implementation compared to the standard class-independent BME implementation. Incidence maps generated by cd-BME are used to study the spatiotemporal HFRS spread patterns. Further, the spatiotemporal dependence of HFRS incidences are measured in terms of probability logic indicators that link class-dependent HFRS incidences at different space-time points. These indicators convey useful complementary information regarding intraclass and interclass relationships, such as the change in HFRS transition probabilities between different incidence classes with increasing geographical distance and time separation.
   Results Each HFRS class exhibited a distinct space-time variation structure in terms of its varying covariance parameters (shape, sill and correlation ranges). Given the heterogeneous features of the HFRS dataset, the cd-BME implementation demonstrated an improved ability to capture these features compared to the standard implementation (e.g., mean absolute error: 0.19 vs. 0.43 cases/10(5) capita) demonstrating a point outbreak character at high incidence levels and a non-point spread character at low levels. Intraclass HFRS variations were found to be considerably different than interclass HFRS variations. Certain incidence classes occurred frequently near one class but were rarely found adjacent to other classes. Different classes may share common boundaries or they may be surrounded completely by another class. The HFRS class 0-68.5% was the most dominant in the Heilongjiang province (covering more than 2/3 of the total area). The probabilities that certain incidence classes occur next to other classes were used to estimate the transitions between HFRS classes. Moreover, such probabilities described the dependency pattern of the space-time arrangement of HFRS patches occupied by the incidence classes. The HFRS transition probabilities also suggested the presence of both positive and negative relations among the main classes. The HFRS indicator plots offer complementary visualizations of the varying probabilities of transition between incidence classes, and so they describe the dependency pattern of the space-time arrangement of the HFRS patches occupied by the different classes.
   Conclusions The cd-BME method combined with probabilistic logic indicators offer an accurate and informative quantitative representation of the heterogeneous HFRS incidences in the space-time domain, and the results thus obtained can be interpreted readily. The same methodological combination could also be used in the spatiotemporal modeling and prediction of other epidemics under similar circumstances.
   Author summary Heilongjiang Province reported the largest number of HFRS cases in China. Previous studies focused on identifying the severe HFRS outbreak regions, exploring the relative impact of environmental factors, forecasting HFRS cases etc. However, the study of the spatiotemporal spread dynamics and patterns of HFRS is still lacking, which is the focus of the present study. This study proposed a novel mapping technique (i.e., class-dependent Bayesian Maximum Entropy, cd-BME) for studying the distribution of HFRS, overcoming the highly heterogeneous features of HFRS data; and, probabilistic logic notions (stochastic indicators) were employed to study the spatiotemporal dependency of HFRS incidence and draw conclusions regarding the HFRS spread under conditions of uncertainty. By dividing the original HFRS data into four classes in terms of percentiles, the cd-BME exhibited better performance in mapping HFRS distribution than the standard (class-independent) BME technique and the mainstream inverse distance technique. Regarding the maps of HFRS distribution, the point outbreak character dominated the HFRS spread at high incidence levels, whereas the lowest incidence level covered more than 2/3 of Heilongjiang Province. Certain HFRS incidence generally occurred between intraclass or neighbor classes. The probabilities of HFRS transition between incidence classes with various spatial distances and temporal instants can be found in the HFRS indicator plots. The above comprehensive information can allow a better understanding of the spatiotemporal HFRS spread mechanisms and further improve HFRS decision-making, management and control.

AB Background Cholera remains a substantial health burden in Asia and Africa particularly in resource poor settings. The standard procedures to identify the etiological organism V. cholerae are isolation from microbiological culture from stool as well as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Both the processes are highly lab oriented, labor extensive, time consuming, and expensive. In an effort to control for outbreaks and epidemics; an effective, convenient, quick and relatively less expensive detection method is imperative, without compromising the sensitivity and specificity that exists at present. The objective of this component of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a locally produced rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for cholera diagnosis.
   Methods In Bangladesh, nationwide cholera surveillance is ongoing in 22 hospitals covering all 8 divisions of the country since June, 2016. In the surveillance, stool samples have been collected from patients presenting to hospitals with acute watery diarrhea. Crystal VCTM (Span diagnostics, India) and Cholkit (locally produced RDT) have been used to detect V. cholerae from stool samples. Samples have also been sent to the main laboratory at icddr,b where the culture based isolation is routinely performed. All the tests were carried out for both direct and enriched stool samples. RDT sensitivity and specificity were calculated using stool culture as the gold standard.
   Results A total of 7720 samples were tested. Among these, 5865 samples were solely tested with Crystal VC and 1355 samples with Cholkit whereas 381 samples were tested with both the RDTs. In comparison with culture, direct testing with Crystal VC showed a sensitivity of 72% (95% CI: 50.6% to 87.9%) and specificity of 86.8% (95% CI: 82.8% to 90.1%). After enrichment the sensitivity and specificity was 68% (95% CI: 46.5% to 85.1%) and 97.5% (95% CI: 95.3% to 98.8%) respectively. The direct Cholkit test showed sensitivity of 76% (95% CI: 54.9% to 90.6%) and specificity of 90.2% (95% CI: 86.6% to 93.1%).
   Conclusion This evaluation has demonstrated that the sensitivity and specificity of Cholkit is similar to the commercially available test, Crystal VC when used in field settings for detecting V. cholerae from stool specimens. The findings from this study suggest that the Cholkit could be a possible alternative for cholera endemic regions where V. cholerae O1 is the major causative organism causing cholera.
   Author summary Cholera still remains a burning public health issue in the developing world. Microbiological culture is the gold standard method for cholera diagnosis. However, it requires well equipped laboratories and 24-72 hours' time for the isolation of pathogens, which may not be feasible for hard to reach areas and during epidemics or seasonal outbreaks. For the effective control of disease outbreaks, detection methods should be both quick and easy without sacrificing specificity and sensitivity. Rapid diagnostic test for cholera could be a potential alternative for early detection of the disease. Addressing this issue in our study, we report the performance of a rapid diagnostic test (RDT), Cholkit for the diagnosis of cholera cases using stool obtained in field settings and the assessment of its performance with those of microbial culture and Crystal VC assay, a commercially available dipstick.

AB Background Dengue is associated with significant economic expenditure and it is estimated that the Asia Pacific region accounts for >50% of the global cost. Indonesia has one of the world's highest dengue burdens; Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are the primary and secondary vectors. In the absence of local data on disease cost, this study estimated the annual economic burden during 2015 of both hospitalized and ambulatory dengue cases in Indonesia.
   Methods Total 2015 dengue costs were calculated using both prospective and retrospective methods using data from public and private hospitals and health centres in three provinces: Yogyakarta, Bali and Jakarta. Direct costs were extracted from billing systems and claims; a patient survey captured indirect and out-of-pocket costs at discharge and 2 weeks later. Adjustments across sites based on similar clinical practices and healthcare landscapes were performed to fill gaps in cost estimates. The national burden of dengue was extrapolated from provincial data using data from the three sites and applying an empirically-derived epidemiological expansion factor.
   Results Total direct and indirect costs per dengue case assessed at Yogyakarta, Bali and Jakarta were US$791, US$1,241 and US$1,250, respectively. Total 2015 economic burden of dengue in Indonesia was estimated at US$381.15 million which comprised US$355.2 million for hospitalized and US$26.2 million for ambulatory care cases.
   Conclusion Dengue imposes a substantial economic burden for Indonesian public payers and society. Complemented with an appropriate weighting method and by accounting for local specificities and practices, these data may support national level public health decision making for prevention/control of dengue in public health priority lists.
   Author summary Dengue, an infection transmitted by mosquitos, is a public health concern particularly in tropical/subtropical areas and the Asia Pacific region where it is associated with a significant cost to society. Indonesia has one of the world's highest dengue burdens but Indonesia-specific data on cost are lacking. To estimate the annual economic burden of dengue in Indonesia, this study collected data from public/private hospitals and health centres in three provinces (Yogyakarta, Bali and Jakarta) during 2015. We estimated cost of illness using the societal perspective: calculations of costs included those that were directly paid by the healthcare system, as well as costs incurred by the patients (or their family/care givers) and their lost productivity. The costs from the three provinces were then used as the basis for extrapolating cost of illness in Indonesia. The authors confirmed that dengue imposed a substantial economic burden for Indonesian public payers and society. Based on 2015 data, the authors estimated total economic burden of dengue in Indonesia at US$381.15 million. Of this, US$355.2 million related to patients treated in hospitals and US$26.2 million was for patients treated in health centres. Establishing a better understanding of the burden of dengue in Indonesia will help to guide public health decision-making at a national level and support prevention and control initiatives for this disease.

TI Community knowledge, attitude, and perceived stigma of leprosy amongst
   community members living in Dhanusha and Parsa districts of Southern
   Central Nepal
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
AB Background Though Nepal declared leprosy elimination in 2010, its burden is constantly rising in Terai communities for the past 2 years with 3000 new leprosy cases being diagnosed annually. Community's perception is important for prevention and control of leprosy and enhancing quality of life of leprosy patients. Poor knowledge, unfavorable attitude and stigma create a hindrance to leprosy control. The main objective of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitude and stigma of leprosy amongst the community members living in Dhanusha and Parsa districts of Southern Central Nepal.
   Methods A total of 423 individuals were interviewed using a structured questionnaire in Dhanusha and Parsa districts. Data was analyzed using both descriptive (frequency, percentage, median) and statistical inferences (Chi-square test, Kruskal Wallis H test, Mann Whitney U test, binary logistic regression) using SPSSvs20.
   Results All respondents had heard about leprosy. Source of information on leprosy was mainly found to be health workers/hospitals (33.1%). Only 62.6% reported bacteria being its cause followed by other myths such as bad blood/curse/heredity/bad deeds (36%). Only 43.8% responded that leprosy is transmitted by prolonged close contact with leprosy patients and 25.7% reported religious rituals as the treatment. Only 42.1% had good knowledge and 40.9% had favorable attitude. Good knowledge of leprosy was highly associated with favorable attitude towards leprosy (P<0.001). The outcome variables- knowledge, attitude and EMIC score were found to have highly significant association with age, sex, ethnicity, religion, education and occupation of the respondents (P<0.001). Having knowledge on leprosy transmission was positively associated with favorable attitude towards leprosy (P<0.001).
   Conclusions Strategizing the awareness programmes according to socio-demographic characteristics for enhancing the knowledge regarding leprosy cause, symptoms, transmission, prevention and treatment, can foster the positive community attitude towards leprosy affected persons. Enhancing positive attitude towards leprosy affected persons can reduce the community stigma, thus may increase their participation in the community. Positive attitude may further increase their early health seeking behaviour including their quality of life.
   Author summary Though Nepal declared leprosy to be no more a public health problem in 2010, its burden is constantly rising in Terai communities for the past 2 years with 3000 new leprosy cases being identified annually. With the fact that community's knowledge and perception is important for prevention and control of leprosy this study aimed at assessing the community knowledge, attitude and stigma of leprosy amongst the community members living in Dhanusha and Parsa districts of Southern Central Nepal. The study was conducted in the communities of Dhanusha and Parsa by interviewing 423 individuals using structured questionnaire. All study respondents had heard about leprosy with main source of information to be health workers/hospital. A good proportion had myths such as bad blood/curse/heredity/bad deeds as the cause of leprosy and reported religious rituals as its treatment. Although more than half had good knowledge, only 2/5(th) had favorable attitude. The attitude was found to be influenced by knowledge. Also, knowledge, attitude and stigma score were found to be influenced by age, sex, ethnicity, religion, education and occupation. Strategizing the awareness programmes according to socio-demographic characteristics for enhancing the knowledge regarding leprosy cause, symptoms, transmission, prevention and treatment, could change the attitude to make it more favorable and thereby would help in reducing leprosy burden and enhancing the quality of life of leprosy patients.

TI Assessment of trachoma in suspected endemic areas within 16 provinces in
   mainland China
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID BLINDNESS
AB Background China used to be among the countries with a high prevalence of trachoma. At the launch of The Global Elimination of Trachoma (GET) 2020 campaign by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1996, China was placed on the list of countries endemic for trachoma based on historical data. However, empirical observation and routinely collected eye care data were suggesting that trachoma was no longer a public health problem. To determine whether the GET 2020 goals had been met in P. R. China, we conducted a targeted assessment with national scope.
   Methodology/principal finding Province assessment teams, trained in WHO Trachoma Rapid Assessment (TRA) methodology and in WHO simplified trachoma grading system, carried out assessments in 16 provinces (among them, 2 provinces conducted pilot assessment). Based on the published literature, including national and international reports, suspected trachoma-endemic areas within each province were identified. Within these areas, trachomatous inflammation- follicular (TF) assessments were carried out in at least 50 grade-one children in primary schools serving villages with the lowest socio-economic development. Trachomatous trichiasis (TT) and corneal opacity (CO) assessments were conducted among persons aged 15 and over in villages within the catchment area of the selected schools. Of 8,259 children examined in 128 primary schools in 97 suspected trachoma endemic areas, only 16 cases of conjunctivitis were graded as TF. 38 cases with TT were found among the 339,013 examined residents in villages surrounding the schools. Among these 97 suspected trachoma endemic areas in only three was the prevalence of TT more than 0.2%.
   Conclusions/significance This large study suggested that trachoma was not a public health problem in 16 provinces that had been previously suspected to be endemic. These findings will facilitate planning for elimination of trachoma from PR China.
   Author summary China used to a country with a high burden of trachoma, but recent empirical observation and routinely collected eye care data were suggesting that elimination of trachoma had been achieved in China. In order to verify that and reach the target set in the WHA 51.11 Resolution, we have assessed current situation using the World Health Organization's Simplified Trachoma Grading System and TRA. As China is a country with a big population and huge regional disparity, this national condition is also considered in methodology design and implement. Among 8,259 children examined in 128 primary schools in 97 suspected trachoma endemic areas, only 16 cases of conjunctivitis were graded as TF. 38 cases with TT were found among the 339,013 examined residents in villages surrounding the schools, among these 97 suspected trachoma endemic areas only in 3 areas, the prevalence of TT was more than 0.2%. Trachoma is no longer a public health issue in China, however, we still need to pay attention to TT in the remote and poor areas. Therapeutic interventions for few residual patients have been provided for free, and health education and publicity on trachoma prevention have been continued in the whole society.

TI Hospital admission on weekends for patients who have surgery and 30-day
   mortality in Ontario, Canada: A matched cohort study
SO PLOS MEDICINE

   DEATH; RISK
AB Background
   Healthcare interventions on weekends have been associated with increased mortality and adverse clinical outcomes, but these findings are inconsistent. We hypothesized that patients admitted to hospital on weekends who have surgery have an increased risk of death compared with patients who are admitted and have surgery on weekdays.
   Methods and findings
   This matched cohort study included 318,202 adult patients from Ontario health administrative and demographic databases, admitted to acute care hospitals from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2015. A total of 159,101 patients who were admitted on weekends and underwent noncardiac surgery were classified by day of surgery (weekend versus weekday) and matched 1:1 to patients who both were admitted and had surgery on a weekday (Tuesday to Thursday); matching was based on age (in years), anesthesia basic unit value for the surgical procedure, median neighborhood household income quintile, resource utilization band (a ranking system of overall morbidity), rurality of home location, year of admission, and urgency of admission. Of weekend admissions, 16.2% (25,872) were elective and 53.9% (85,744) had surgery on the weekend of admission. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 30 days of the date of hospital admission. The 30-day all-cause mortality for patients admitted on weekends who had noncardiac surgery was 2.6% (4,211/159,101) versus 2.5% (3,901/159,101) for those who were admitted and had surgery on weekdays (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.05; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11; P = 0.03). However, there was significant heterogeneity in the increased odds of death according to the urgency of admission and when surgery was performed (weekend versus weekday). For urgent admissions on weekends (n = 133,229), there was no significant increase in odds of mortality when surgery was performed on the weekend (adjusted OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.09; P = 0.7) or on a subsequent weekday (adjusted OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.12; P = 0.2) compared to urgent admissions on weekdays. Elective admissions on weekends (n = 25,782) had increased risk of death both when surgery was performed on the weekend (adjusted OR 3.30; 95% CI 1.98 to 5.49; P < 0.001) and when surgery was performed on a subsequent weekday (adjusted OR 2.70; 95% CI 1.81 to 4.03; P < 0.001). The main limitations of this study were the lack of data regarding reason for admission and cause of increased time interval from admission to surgery for some cases, the small number of deaths in some subgroups (i.e., elective surgery), and the possibility of residual unmeasured confounding from increased illness severity for weekend admissions.
   Conclusions
   When patients have surgery during their hospitalization, admission on weekends in Ontario, Canada, was associated with a small but significant proportional increase in 30-day all-cause mortality, but there was significant heterogeneity in outcomes depending on the urgency of admission and when surgery was performed. An increased risk of death was found only for elective admissions on weekends; whether this is a function of patient-level factors or represents a true weekend effect needs to be further elucidated. These findings have potential implications for resource allocation in hospitals and the redistribution of elective surgery to weekends.

AB Background
   Epidemiological studies have provided compelling evidence of associations between ambient temperature and cardiovascular disease. However, evidence of effects of daily temperature variability on cardiovascular disease is scarce and mixed. We aimed to examine short-term associations between temperature variability and hospital admissions for cause-specific cardiovascular disease in urban China.
   Methods and findings
   We conducted a national time-series analysis in 184 cities in China between 2014 and 2017. Data on daily hospital admissions for ischemic heart disease, heart failure, heart rhythm disturbances, and ischemic stroke were obtained from the database of Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) including 0.28 billion enrollees. Temperature data were acquired from the China Meteorological Data Sharing Service Center. Temperature variability was calculated from the standard deviation (SD) of daily minimum and maximum temperatures over exposure days. City-specific associations between temperature variability and cardiovascular disease were examined with overdispersed Poisson models controlling for calendar time, day of the week, public holiday, and daily mean temperature and relative humidity. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to obtain national and regional average associations. We also plotted exposure-response relationship curve using a natural cubic spline of temperature variability. There were 8.0 million hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease during the study period. At the national-average level, a 1-degrees C increase in temperature variability at 0-1 days (TV0-1) was associated with a 0.44% (0.32%-0.55%), 0.31% (0.20%-0.43%), 0.48% (0.01%-0.96%), 0.34% (0.01%-0.67%), and 0.82% (0.59%-1.05%) increase in hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, heart rhythm disturbances, and ischemic stroke, respectively. The estimates decreased but remained significant when controlling for ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5), NO2, and SO2 pollution. The main limitation of the present study was the unavailability of data on individual exposure to temperature variability.
   Conclusions
   Our findings suggested that short-term temperature variability exposure could increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, which may provide new insights into the health effects of climate change.

AB Bats are newly identified reservoirs of hantaviruses (HVs) among which very divergent HVs have been discovered in recent years. However, their significance for public health remains unclear since their seroprevalence as well as antigenic relationship with human-infecting HVs have not been investigated. In the present study archived tissues of 1,419 bats of 22 species from 6 families collected in 5 south and southwest provinces in China were screened by pan-HV RT-PCR following viral metagenomic analysis. As a result nine HVs have been identified in two bat species in two provinces and phylogenetically classified into two species, Laibin virus (LAIV, ICTV approved species, 1 strain) and Xuan son virus (XSV, proposed species, 8 strains). Additionally, 709 serum samples of these bats were also analyzed by ELISA to investigate the seroprevalence and cross-reactivity between different HVs using expressed recombinant nucleocapsid proteins (rNPs) of LAIV, XSV and Seoul virus (SEOV). The cross-reactivity of some bat sera were further confirmed by western blot (WB) using three rNPs followed by fluorescent antibody virus neutralization test (FAVNT) against live SEOV. Results showed that the total HV seropositive rate of bat sera was 18.5% (131/709) with many cross reacting with two or all three rNPs and several able to neutralize SEOV. WB analysis using the three rNPs and their specific hyperimmune sera demonstrated cross-reactivity between XSV/SEOV and LAIV/XSV, but not LAIV/SEOV, indicating that XSV is antigenically closer to human-infecting HVs. In addition a study of the distribution of the viruses identified an area covering the region between Chinese Guangxi and North Vietnam, in which XSV and LAIV circulate within different bat colonies with a high seroprevalence. A circulation sphere of bat-borne HVs has therefore been proposed.
   Author summary Some HVs are life-threatening pathogens predominantly carried and transmitted by rodents. In recent years bat-borne HVs have been identified in a broad range of bat species. To understand their significance to public health the present study conducted extensive investigations on genetic diversity, seroprevalence, distribution and cross antigenicity of bat-borne HVs in south and southwest China. The results provide the first profiling of cross-reactivity between bat-borne and human-infecting HVs, demonstrating that some bat sera can neutralize SEOV in cell culture. They also revealed that divergent bat-borne HVs co-exist and are widely distributed in Chinese Guangxi/Yunnan as well as in north Vietnam, resulting in identification of an area between China and Vietnam in which natural circulation of bat-borne HVs is maintained. Given the existence of bat-borne HVs genetically and antigenically close to human-infecting HVs, the need for extensive future studies is emphasized in order to assess the potential risk of these viruses to public health.

AB BackgroundEarly and accurate identification of potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for combined medication is vital for public health. Existing methods either rely on expensive wet-lab experiments or detecting existing associations from related records. Thus, they inevitably suffer under-reporting, delays in reporting, and inability to detect ADRs for new and rare drugs. The current application of machine learning methods is severely impeded by the lack of proper drug representation and credible negative samples. Therefore, a method to represent drugs properly and to select credible negative samples becomes vital in applying machine learning methods to this problem.ResultsIn this work, we propose a machine learning method to predict ADRs of combined medication from pharmacologic databases by building up highly-credible negative samples (HCNS-ADR). Specifically, we fuse heterogeneous information from different databases and represent each drug as a multi-dimensional vector according to its chemical substructures, target proteins, substituents, and related pathways first. Then, a drug-pair vector is obtained by appending the vector of one drug to the other. Next, we construct a drug-disease-gene network and devise a scoring method to measure the interaction probability of every drug pair via network analysis. Drug pairs with lower interaction probability are preferentially selected as negative samples. Following that, the validated positive samples and the selected credible negative samples are projected into a lower-dimensional space using the principal component analysis. Finally, a classifier is built for each ADR using its positive and negative samples with reduced dimensions. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on simulative prediction for 1276 ADRs and 1048 drugs, comparing using four machine learning algorithms and with two baseline approaches. Extensive experiments show that the proposed way to represent drugs characterizes drugs accurately. With highly-credible negative samples selected by HCNS-ADR, the four machine learning algorithms achieve significant performance improvements. HCNS-ADR is also shown to be able to predict both known and novel drug-drug-ADR associations, outperforming two other baseline approaches significantly.ConclusionsThe results demonstrate that integration of different drug properties to represent drugs are valuable for ADR prediction of combined medication and the selection of highly-credible negative samples can significantly improve the prediction performance.

DT Article
ID QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; ETHICS; SERVICES; EXPERIENCE
AB Background
   Primary health care institutions are looking for opportunities to create value for patients and to increase the competitiveness of the health care institution. Determination of competitive priorities for creation of value for patients in the management of primary health care institutions allows improving competitiveness and achieving a competitive advantage in the market.
   The aim of the study
   To determine the priorities in the management of public and private primary health care institutions by using the focus group discussion method with managers.
   Methods
   The study was exploratory with intention to find a ground for a management theory and to be the root for the development of health care reform in Lithuania. Focus group discussions were held in 10 Lithuanian counties; 10 focus group sessions were carried out. A total of 48 primary health care executives were interviewed. The participants of this qualitative study were given 8 questions related to value creation of the primary health care institution to patients and rise in competitiveness. The main question of the focus group discussion was "What are the main priorities of management of primary health care institution?" The criteria of data collection based on the deep understanding of the phenomenon and the richness of data expressed by participants of the research.
   Results
   Qualitative research showed that the priorities of management of primary health care institutions were work management of an organization; human resources management; patient management; and health policy decision making. The participants of focus groups pointed out that effective work of primary health care institutions is ensured by the model of management, doctor-patient communication, quality and timely delivery of health care services, and financial resources. The major decisions involving the management of patients were as follows: meeting patients' expectations, quality and timely satisfaction of patients' needs, effective solution of patients' problems, patient-centered services, patient satisfaction, and communication with the patient. Accessibility to services, quality, geographical accessibility, disease prevention, strengthening of patients' health and adequate funding were mentioned as the priorities of health policy.

TI Managing the risk of Hendra virus spillover in Australia using
   ecological approaches: A report on three community juries
SO PLOS ONE

AB Background
   Hendra virus (HeV) infection is endemic in Australian flying-fox populations. Habitat loss has increased the peri-urban presence of flying-foxes, increasing the risk of contact and therefore viral 'spillovers' into horse and human populations. An equine vaccine is available and horse-husbandry practices that minimize HeV exposure are encouraged, but their adoption is suboptimal. Ecological approaches-such as habitat creation and conservation-could complement vaccination and behavioural strategies by reducing spillover risks, but these are controversial.
   Methods
   We convened three community juries (two regional; one metropolitan) to elicit the views of well-informed citizens on the acceptability of adding ecological approaches to current interventions for HeV risk. Thirty-one participants of diverse backgrounds, mixed genders and ages were recruited using random-digit-dialling. Each jury was presented with balanced factual evidence, given time to ask questions of expert presenters and, after deliberation, come to well-reasoned conclusions.
   Results
   All juries voted unanimously that ecological strategies should be included in HeV risk management strategies but concluded that current interventions-including vaccination and changing horse-husbandry practices-must remain the priority. The key reasons given for adopting ecological approaches were: (i) they address underlying drivers of disease emergence, (ii) the potential to prevent spillover of other bat-borne pathogens, and (iii) there would be broader community benefits. Juries differed regarding the best mechanism to create/conserve flying-fox habitat: participants in regional centres favoured direct government action, whereas the metropolitan jury preferred to place the burden on landholders.
   Conclusions
   Informed citizens acknowledge the value of addressing the drivers of bat-borne infectious risks but differ substantially as to the best implementation strategies. Ecological approaches to securing bat habitat could find broad social support in Australia, but disagreement about how best to achieve them indicates the need for negotiation with affected communities to co-develop fair, effective and locally appropriate policies.

AB This is the first review of the evidence, based on longitudinal studies in the United Kingdom, on the association of ill health at any life stage and later social and economic outcomes. The review included a wide range of physical and mental health exposures, both self-reported and objectively measured, as well as social (e.g. life satisfaction) and economic (e.g. employment) outcomes. We searched the Web of Science, key longitudinal datasets based in the UK, major economic journals, Google Scholar and reference lists of relevant publications. The review includes 80 studies. There was strong evidence for the association between early mental health, mainly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and lifetime educational, occupational and various social outcomes. Also, both poor physical and mental health in early and middle adulthood, tended to be associated with unemployment and lower socioeconomic status. Among older adults, the evidence quite consistently indicated an association between mental health, chronic conditions, disability/functional limitations, self-rated general health and quality of life, life satisfaction and early retirement. Overall, mental health was consistently found to be associated with a range of social and economic outcomes throughout the lifespan. The evidence for the association between physical health and later outcomes is more inconsistent. A number of methodological challenges need to be addressed, particularly related to causal inference, to produce robust evidence with potential to inform public health policy.

AB Background
   Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus are the primary vectors that transmit several arboviral diseases, including dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. The world is presently experiencing a series of outbreaks of these diseases, so, we still require to better understand the current distributions and possible future shifts of their vectors for successful surveillance and control programs. Few studies assessed the influences of climate change on the spatial distributional patterns and abundance of these important vectors, particularly using the most recent climatic scenarios. Here, we updated the current potential distributions of both vectors and assessed their distributional changes under future climate conditions.
   Methods
   We used ecological niche modeling approach to estimate the potential distributions of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus under present-day and future climate conditions. This approach fits ecological niche model from occurrence records of each species and environmental variables. For each species, future projections were based on climatic data from 9 general circulation models (GCMs) for each representative concentration pathway (RCP) in each time period, with a total of 72 combinations in four RCPs in 2050 and 2070. All ENMs were tested using the partial receiver operating characteristic (pROC) and a set of 2,048 and 2,003 additional independent records for Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, respectively. Finally, we used background similarity test to assess the similarity between the ENMs of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus.
   Results
   The predicted potential distribution of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus coincided with the current and historical known distributions of both species. Aedes aegypti showed a markedly broader distributional potential across tropical and subtropical regions than Ae. albopictus. Interestingly, Ae. albopictus was markedly broader in distributional potential across temperate Europe and the United States. All ecological niche models (ENMs) were statistically robust (P < 0.001). ENMs successfully anticipated 98% (1,999/2,048) and 99% (1,985/2,003) of additional independent records for both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, respectively (P < 0.001). ENMs based on future conditions showed similarity between the overall distributional patterns of future-day and present-day conditions; however, there was a northern range expansion in the continental USA to include parts of Southern Canada in case of Ae. albopictus in both 2050 and 2070. Future models also anticipated further expansion of Ae. albopictus to the East to include most of Europe in both time periods. Aedes aegypti was anticipated to expand to the South in East Australia in 2050 and 2070. The predictions showed differences in distributional potential of both species between diverse RCPs in 2050 and 2070. Finally, the background similarity test comparing the ENMs of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus was unable to reject the null hypothesis of niche similarity between both species (P > 0.05).
   Conclusion
   These updated maps provided details to better guide surveillance and control programs of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. They have also significant public health importance as a baseline for predicting the emergence of arboviral diseases transmitted by both vectors in new areas across the world.

AB Physicians' motivation plays avital role in health systems particularly in dense and urban cities, which deal with high volumes of patients in a variety of settings. The loss of physicians due to low motivation to developed countries is also a critical aspect affecting the quality of care in many regions. Fewer studies have explored health provider and particularly physicians' motivation in developing countries, which is critical to health service delivery. In addition, limited relevant tools have been developed and tested in low and middle-income settings like Pakistan. The purpose of this study was to create and test a tool for measuring physician motivation. A tool was developed to explore physicians' motivation in the Lahore district, Pakistan. Three sections of the questionnaire, which included intrinsic, socio-cultural and organizational factors, were tested with a stratified, random sample of 360 physicians from the public and private health facilities. Factor analysis produced six factors for 'intrinsic motivation,' seven for 'organizational motivation' and three for 'socio-cultural motivation' that explained 47.7%, 52.6% and 40.6% of the total variance, respectively. Bartlett's test of sphericity and the KMO were significant. Cronbach's a and confirmatory factor analysis were found satisfactory for all three sections of questionnaires. In addition to identifying important intrinsic, socio-cultural and organizational factors study found the questionnaires reliable and valid and recommend further testing the applicability of the instrument in similar and diverse settings.

TI Progress toward implementing the Swiss Hepatitis Strategy: Is HCV
   elimination possible by 2030?
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID C VIRUS-INFECTION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PREVALENCE
AB Catalyzed by the concerns over the growing public health and economic burden of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) in Switzerland, a diverse group of experts and patient representatives came together in 2014 to develop the Swiss Hepatitis Strategy, setting targets for the elimination of viral hepatitis in Switzerland by 2030. Previous studies have reported the estimated number of chronic HCV infections and forecasted burden of disease given different intervention strategies. However, given new prevalence data by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, which decreased total infections by about half, an updated analysis is warranted. We aimed to provide an updated viremic prevalence estimate for Switzerland and evaluate the impact on forecasted liver related morbidity and mortality of an 'inaction' scenario and intervention scenarios to achieve the Global Health Sector Strategy for Viral Hepatitis and Swiss Hepatitis Strategy goals by 2030. A Markov disease-progression model was used to calculate the present and future burden of HCV infection by disease stage according to these different strategies. In 2017, there were an estimated 36,800 (95% UI: 26,90039,200) viremic infections in Switzerland. Given the current standard of care, total viremic infections are expected to decline by 45%, while cases of decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related deaths will decrease by 20%. If treatment and diagnosis efforts were to cease in 2018, late stage HCV-related morbidity and mortality would increase by 90-100% by 2030. Increasing treatment and diagnosis to achieve the Global Health Sector Strategy or Swiss Hepatitis Strategy goals by 2030, will reduce the number of chronic infections to less than 13,000 and 4,000, respectively. Although the HCV epidemic is declining in Switzerland, efforts to expand diagnosis and treatment are needed to achieve elimination by 2030.

   health professionals in New Zealand
SO PLOS ONE

   INFECTION; BEHAVIORS; PARENTS; NURSES
AB Background
   Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection that is implicated in 99.7% of cervical cancers and several other cancers that affect both men and women. Despite the role that HPV plays in an estimated 5% of all cancers and the evolving role of HPV vaccination and testing in protecting the public against these cancers, preliminary research in New Zealand health professionals suggest knowledge about HPV may not be sufficient.
   Methods
   A total of 230 practice nurses, smear takers and other clinical and laboratory staff who attended a range of training events completed a cross-sectional survey between April 2016 and July 2017. The survey explored four broad areas: demographics and level of experience, HPV knowledge (general HPV knowledge, HPV triage and test of cure (TOC) knowledge and HPV vaccine knowledge), attitudes towards the HPV vaccine and self-perceived adequacy of HPV knowledge.
   Results
   The mean score on the general HPV knowledge questions was 13.2 out of 15, with only 25.2% of respondents scoring 100%. In response to an additional question, 12.7% thought (or were unsure) that HPV causes HIV/AIDS. The mean score on the HPV Triage and TOC knowledge questions was 7.4 out of 10, with only 9.1% scoring 100%. The mean score on the HPV vaccine knowledge questions was 6.0 out of 7 and 44.3% scored 100%. Only 63.7% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they were adequately informed about HPV, although 73.3% agreed or strongly agreed that they could confidently answer HPV-related questions asked by patients. Multivariate analyses revealed that knowledge in each domain predicted confidence in responding to patient questions. Furthermore, the number of years since training predicted both HPV knowledge and Triage and TOC knowledge.
   Discussion
   Although overall level of knowledge was adequate, there were significant gaps in knowledge, particularly about the role of HPV testing in the New Zealand National Cervical Screening Programme. More education is required to ensure that misinformation and stigma do not inadvertently result from interactions between health professionals and the public.

AB BackgroundEvidence is scarce on the trend in prevalence of geriatric syndromes (GS). This study assesses how GS prevalence changes over time in Swedish older community-dwellers by socio-demography, and attempts to highlight factors that may contribute to explain the trend.MethodsData from Stockholm County Council Public Health Surveys in 2006, 2010 and 2014 were used. Old adults, aged 65-84years, with measurements on GS items were identified. Thus, a total of 17,560 participants were selected in 2006 (n=6295), 2010 (n=6733) and 2014 (n=4532). Data on socio-demographics, lifestyles and health status were collected through questionnaires. GS was defined as having at least one of the following: insomnia, urinary incontinence, severe hearing/vision problem, functional decline, fall and depressive disorder. Logistic regression was performed to assess the prevalence trend as well as the change in the associations of sociodemographic factors, health behaviors and chronic disease with GS.ResultsFrom 2006 to 2014, the prevalence of GS remained stable (P-trend=0.54). However, among old adults born outside Nordic countries, it increased significantly from 73.0% in 2006, 78.0% in 2010 to 83.0% in 2014 (P-trend<0.001). Furthermore, the association with GS became stronger for born outside Nordic counties (P-trend<0.001) and weaker for sedentary lifestyles (P-trend=0.004), whereas the association did not change for other sociodemographic factors, health behaviors and chronic disease (all P-trend>0.05).ConclusionsAt population level, GS prevalence remained stable at a high level among Swedish old community-dwellers. There are noteworthy differences in GS trend between population groups, in particular to the detriment of older adults born outside Nordic countries.

AB BackgroundMental health among adolescents is an important public health challenge. School health services perform central public health functions in Norwegian municipalities, where school nurses are uniquely positioned to educate and promote mental health among adolescents. MEST (MEST is not an acronym; MEST is a short version of the Norwegian word for coping) is a newly developed universal working strategy for school health services that aims to promote positive mental health literacy (MHL) and mental wellbeing in the adolescent population. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential outcome mean differences in positive MHL and mental wellbeing between adolescents who participated and those who did not participate in MEST over a school year.MethodsThis study is based on cohort data collected from 357 adolescents (aged 15-21years) in five Norwegian upper secondary schools at the beginning and end of the 2016/2017 school year. The data were analyzed by describing mean scores and estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) of MEST on positive MHL and mental wellbeing.ResultsPositive MHL increased significantly more among the MEST participants compared to the non-MEST participants (p=.02). No significant change in mental wellbeing was found between MEST and non-MEST participants (p=.98). Estimating the ATE of MEST on positive MHL, the MEST participants showed a significant 2.1% increase (p=.04) in the potential outcome mean of positive MHL compared to the nonparticipants. Estimating the ATE of MEST on mental wellbeing, the girls who attended MEST exhibited a significant 9.7% increase (p=.03) in the potential outcome mean of mental wellbeing compared with the girls who did not attend MEST, while no significant change (p=.99) was detected among boys or the entire sample of both genders combined (p=.12).ConclusionThis study found a significant ATE of MEST on positive MHL and on mental wellbeing among girls. The results support further investments in studying MEST as a promising work strategy for school health services to promote adolescent mental health. This initial study of MEST may be used as a foundation for investing in future evaluations of MEST.

ID DRUG SHORTAGES
AB BackgroundOff-patent pharmaceuticals (OPPs) hold vital importance in meeting public health objectives, especially in developing countries where resources are limited. OPPs are comprised of off-patent originals, branded generics and unbranded generics; nonetheless, these products are not identical and often there are differences in their equivalence, manufacturing quality standards and reliability of supply. This necessitates reconsideration of the lowest price policy objective in pharmaceutical decision making. The aim of this study was to develop a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) framework through a pilot workshop to inform the national procurement of OPPs in Indonesia.MethodsAn initial list of potentially relevant criteria was identified based on previous work and a literature review. In a 2-day pilot policy workshop, twenty local experts representing different stakeholder groups and decision-making bodies selected the final criteria, approved the scoring function for each criterion, and assigned weights to each criterion.ResultsAn MCDA framework was proposed for OPP drug decision making in developing countries, which included price and 8 non-price criteria. Based on the pilot policy workshop 6+1 criteria were considered relevant for Indonesia: pharmaceutical price (40% weight), manufacturing quality (18.8%), equivalence with the reference product (12.2%), product stability and drug formulation (12.2%), reliability of drug supply (8.4%), real world clinical or economic outcomes, such as adherence or non-drug costs (4.2%) and pharmacovigilance (3.6%).ConclusionsAccording to the pilot policy workshop, other criteria apart from price need to be strengthened in the tendering process. The introduction of additional criteria for OPP procurement in an MCDA framework creates incentives for manufacturers to invest into improved manufacturing standards, equivalence proof, product quality, reliability of supply or even additional real-world data collection, which ultimately may result in more health gain for the society.

AB BackgroundTo investigate the effects after twelve months related to patient activation and a range of secondary outcomes on persons with chronic pain of a chronic pain self-management course compared to a low-impact outdoor physical activity, delivered in an easily accessible healthcare service in public primary care.MethodsAn open, pragmatic, parallel group randomised controlled trial was conducted. The intervention group was offered a group-based chronic pain self-management course with 2.5-h weekly sessions for a period of six weeks comprising education that included cognitive and behavioural strategies for pain management, movement exercises, group discussions and sharing of experiences among participants. The control group was offered a drop-in, low-impact, outdoor physical activity in groups in one-hour weekly sessions that included walking and simple strength exercises for a period of six weeks. The primary outcome was patient activation assessed using the Patient Activation Measure (PAM-13). Secondary outcomes included assessments of pain, anxiety and depression, pain self-efficacy, sense of coherence, health-related quality of life, well-being and the 30-s Chair to Stand Test. Analyses were performed using a linear mixed model.ResultsAfter twelve months, there were no statistically significant differences between the intervention group (n=60) and the control group (n=61) for the primary or the secondary outcomes. The estimated mean difference between the groups for the primary outcome PAM was 4.0 (CI 95% -0.6 to 8.6, p=0.085). Within both of the groups, there were statistically significant improvements in pain experienced during the previous week, the global self-rated health measure and the 30-s Chair to Stand Test.ConclusionsNo long-term effect of the chronic pain self-management course was found in comparison with a low-impact physical activity intervention for the primary outcome patient activation or for any secondary outcome.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02531282.

AB BackgroundNowadays, trendy research in biomedical sciences juxtaposes the term precision' to medicine and public health with companion words like big data, data science, and deep learning. Technological advancements permit the collection and merging of large heterogeneous datasets from different sources, from genome sequences to social media posts or from electronic health records to wearables. Additionally, complex algorithms supported by high-performance computing allow one to transform these large datasets into knowledge. Despite such progress, many barriers still exist against achieving precision medicine and precision public health interventions for the benefit of the individual and the population.Main bodyThe present work focuses on analyzing both the technical and societal hurdles related to the development of prediction models of health risks, diagnoses and outcomes from integrated biomedical databases. Methodological challenges that need to be addressed include improving semantics of study designs: medical record data are inherently biased, and even the most advanced deep learning's denoising autoencoders cannot overcome the bias if not handled a priori by design. Societal challenges to face include evaluation of ethically actionable risk factors at the individual and population level; for instance, usage of gender, race, or ethnicity as risk modifiers, not as biological variables, could be replaced by modifiable environmental proxies such as lifestyle and dietary habits, household income, or access to educational resources.ConclusionsData science for precision medicine and public health warrants an informatics-oriented formalization of the study design and interoperability throughout all levels of the knowledge inference process, from the research semantics, to model development, and ultimately to implementation.

AB BackgroundThe public health sector is moving toward adopting evidence-informed decision making into practice, but effort is still required to effectively develop capacity and promote contextual factors that advance and sustain it. This paper describes the impact of an organization-wide knowledge translation intervention delivered by knowledge brokers on evidence-informed decision making knowledge, skills and behaviour.MethodsA case study design was implemented with the intervention and data collection tailored to the unique needs of each case (health department). A knowledge broker provided training workshops and mentored small groups through a seven step process of evidence-informed decision making. The intervention was delivered over 22months; data related to evidence-informed decision making knowledge, skills and behaviour were collected at baseline and follow-up. Mixed effects regression models were developed to assess the impact of involvement in the intervention on the evidence-informed decision making outcomes.ResultsData from a total of 606 health department staff were collected during baseline: 207 (33%) staff from Case A, 304 (28%) from Case B, and 95 (47%) from Case C. There were a total of 804 participants at follow-up: 258 (42%) from Case A, 391 from Case B (37%), and 155 (50%) from Case C. Statistically significant increases in knowledge and skills were observed overall, and in all three health departments. An increase in evidence-informed decision making behaviour was observed among those intensively involved in the intervention from all cases (statistically significant in Case A). The organizational characteristics of strategic priority, leadership, readiness, and choice of staff emerged as important factors in the change process.ConclusionsKnowledge brokering is a promising organizational knowledge translation intervention to support evidence-informed decision making. The intervention appeared to have the greatest impact on those who became actively engaged with the knowledge broker in the intervention. Active participation in face-to-face training activities with a knowledge broker, focused specifically on evidence-informed decision making skill development, led to the greatest impact on associated behaviours, knowledge, and skills. Several organizational factors emerged as integral to success of the knowledge translation intervention.

TI Choosing important health outcomes for comparative effectiveness
   research: 4th annual update to a systematic review of core outcome sets
   for research
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Review
AB Background
   The Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) database is a publically available, searchable repository of published and ongoing core outcome set (COS) studies. An annual systematic review update is carried out to maintain the currency of database content.
   Methods
   The methods used in the fourth update of the systematic review followed the same approach used in the original review and previous updates. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported the development of a COS, regardless of any restrictions by age, health condition or setting. Searches were carried out in March 2018 to identify studies that had been published or indexed between January 2017 and the end of December 2017.
   Results
   Forty-eight new studies, describing the development of 56 COS, were included. There has been an increase in the number of studies clearly specifying the scope of the COS in terms of the population (n = 43, 90%) and intervention (n = 48, 100%) characteristics. Public participation has continued to rise with over half (n = 27, 56%) of studies in the current review including input from members of the public. The rate of inclusion of all stakeholder groups has increased, in particular participation from non-clinical research experts has risen from 32% (mean average in previous reviews) to 62% (n = 29). Input from participants located in Australasia (n = 17; 41%), Asia (n = 18; 44%), South America (n = 13; 32%) and Africa (n = 7; 17%) have all increased since the previous reviews.
   Conclusion
   This update included a pronounced increase in the number of new COS identified compared to the previous three updates. There was an improvement in the reporting of the scope, stakeholder participants and methods used. Furthermore, there has been an increase in participation from Australasia, Asia, South America and Africa. These advancements are reflective of the efforts made in recent years to raise awareness about the need for COS development and uptake, as well as developments in COS methodology.

AB Noroviruses (NoVs) are the leading cause of acute viral gastroenteritis outbreaks. From June 2015 to March 2017, fifteen outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) were reported to the Jinan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in China. To identify the circulating NoV genotypes associated with outbreaks in Jinan, China, 414 specimens from the 15 outbreaks were collected and analyzed for the causative viruses, and phylogenetic analysis was performed on the NoV-positive strains. The NoV detection rate was 57.5% (238/414), and a total of 14 outbreaks were caused by NoVs (eight by infection with genogroup II (GII), five by mixed infection with GI and GII, and one by mixed infection with GII and rotavirus (RoV)-A). A total of 75 NoV sequences were obtained from 13 NoV-positive outbreaks and classified into seven genotypes (38 GII.17, 13 GII.2, 4 GII.3, 4 GII.1, 10 GI.6, 5 GI.5 and 1 GI.3), while GII.4 was not identified. The most prevalent genotype changed yearly during the 2015-2017 period. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that these NoV genotypes had high homology with the strains circulating worldwide, especially strains from Asian countries and cities. Our study illustrated that multiple non-GII.4 NoV genotypes were prevalent in outbreaks of AGE in Jinan, China. Year-round surveillance of multiple NoV genotypes could help health authorities reduce the impact of NoV outbreaks on public health.

AB BackgroundAn explosive outbreak of Legionnaires' disease (LD) was identified on 11 December 2015 in Manzanares, Ciudad Real, Spain, and was declared closed by 03 February 2016. The number of declared cases was 593 with 277 confirmed cases so that it can be considered as one of the outbreaks with highest attack rate. This rate could be attributed to the ageing of the population, among others, in addition to various risk factors and habits, and the meteorological conditions (thermal inversion) maintained in this municipality at the time. The Public Health Services succeeded in breaking the bacterial transmission. Several facilities were early identified by microbiological analysis, including a cooling tower and a decorative fountain, as possible infectious sources. Rapid analytical techniques for rapid Legionella detection and the shutdown and preventative closure of positive installations have been considered key elements in the control of this outbreak.ResultsRapid microbiological analysis helped to the early identification of potential risk sources in a Legionnaires disease outbreak, reducing decision-making processes according to the actual needs of the intervention in public health and shortening the exposure of the population.Conclusions Protocolized and immediate intervention in an outbreak is a crucial issue to reduce their effects on public health. For this, identification and control of the suspicious sources able to disseminate the bacteria and cause the illness is required. Rapid analytical techniques like immunomagnetic separation (IMS) method based on the whole bacterial cell detection are shown as excellent tools to investigate all the potential sources of risk.

AB BackgroundChina has made substantial progress in tackling its HIV and AIDS epidemic. But the changing patterns of HIV and AIDS incidence based on the longitudinal observation data were rarely studied.MethodsThe reporting incidence (RI) and mortality data on HIV and AIDS in China covering 31 provinces from 2004 to 2014 were collected from the Chinese Public Health Science Data Center. To decompose the time-series data, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) was applied to properly describe the trends of HIV and AIDS incidence. A mathematical model was used to estimate the relative change of incidence among provinces and age groups.ResultsA total of 483,010 newly HIV infections and 214,205 AIDS cases were reported between 2004 and 2014 nationwide. HIV infection increased from 13,258 in 2004 (RI 1.02 per 100,000 person years) to 74,048 in 2014 (RI 5.46 per 100,000). The number of AIDS cases increased from 3054 in 2004 (RI 0.23 per 100,000) to 45,145 in 2014 (RI 3.33 per 100,000). The overall relative changes for HIV infection and AIDS incidence were 1.11 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-1.13) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.23-1.33), respectively. The relative increase for HIV and AIDS RI was higher in northwest provinces while lower in Henan, Xinjiang, Guangxi and Yunnan. The overall relative changes for HIV infection were 1.12 (95% CI 1.11-1.14) in males and 1.10 (95% CI 1.06-1.13) in females. For AIDS RI, the relative increases were 1.31 (95% CI 1.26-1.36) in males and 1.22 (95% CI 1.17-1.28) in females. The lowest relative increase was detected among young adults, while the largest relative increase (odds ratio [OR]>1.30) was detected in people aged 55years or above.ConclusionsHIV and AIDS showed an increasing trend in China from 2004 to 2014, respectively, but the epidemic tended to be under control among provinces and young people that used to have a high HIV and AIDS incidence. Northwest China and older people could be new hop-spots for HIV and AIDS risk.

AB BackgroundWe Act is a health-promoting school intervention comprising an educational, a parental and a school component. The intervention was implemented in 4 Danish public schools with 4 control schools. The objectives were to improve pupils' dietary habits, physical activity, well-being and social capital using the Investigation, Vision, Action & Change (IVAC) health educational methodology. The target group was pupils in grades 5-6. The purpose of this study was to evaluate implementation fidelity and interacting context factors in the intervention schools.MethodsThe Medical Research Council's new guidance for process evaluation was used as a framework. Data were collected concurrently and evenly at the 4 intervention schools through field visits (n=43days), questionnaires (n=17 teachers, 52 parents), and interviews (n=9 teachers, 4 principals, 52 pupils). The data were analysed separately and via triangulation.ResultsA total of 289 pupils participated, and 22 teachers delivered the educational component in 12 classes. In all schools, the implementation fidelity to the educational methodology was high for the Investigation and Vision phases as the teachers delivered the proposed lessons and activities. However, the implementation fidelity to the Action & Change phase was low, and little change occurred in the schools. The pupils' presentation of their visions did not work as intended as an impact mechanism to prompt actions. The implementation of the parental and the school components was weak. The main context factors influencing implementation fidelity were a poor fit into the school-year plan and weak management support.ConclusionsAlthough We Act' was designed to comply with evidence- and theory-based requirements, IVAC and the health-promoting school approach did not result in change. The time dedicated to schools' preparation and competence development may have been too low. This must be considered in future process evaluation research on health-promoting schools and by school health promotion administrators when planning future school interventions.Trial registrationISRCTN85203017

TI Do young black men who have sex with men in the deep south prefer
   traditional over alternative STI testing?
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SEXUALLY-TRANSMITTED INFECTION; MYCOPLASMA-GENITALIUM; HIV; HEALTH;
   PERFORMANCE; CHLAMYDIA
AB Background
   High sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates in the South, especially among young black men who have sex with men (YB MSM), make STI testing imperative for public health.
   Purpose
   To identify STI testing preferences in this population to improve testing delivery and utilization.
   Methods
   YB MSM ages 16-35 in Birmingham, Alabama participated in focus groups (FG). A trained qualitative researcher coded transcripts after each FG and added questions to explore emerging themes.
   Results
   Between September 2017 and January 2018, 36 YB MSM participated in 5 focus groups. Median age was 25.5 (Interquartile range 22-30). Participants preferred STI testing at doctors' offices conducted by physicians but they also preferred having options related to testing locations, frequency, and timing to address diverse needs. Participants did not prefer testing by non-physician staff or home self-testing.
   Conclusion
   A variety of options, including varied locations, personnel, and methods (self-collected and provider collected) are needed to make patient-preferred STI testing a reality among YB MSM in the Deep South. Further, the desire to be tested by a trusted physician highlights the need for access to primary care providers. Results suggest that newer home-based tests and self-collected tests are less preferable to YB MSM in the South, which deserves further study as these tests are rapidly integrated into clinical care.

TI Valuation of the EQ-5D-5L in Taiwan
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID VALUE SET; HEALTH STATES; VERSION; CARE
AB Objectives
   To date, a value set for the EQ-5D-5L based on the health state preferences of the general Taiwanese population has not been available. This study aimed to develop a Taiwanese value set for EQ-5D-5L to facilitate health technology assessment for medical products and services.
   Methods
   An international standardized protocol for EQ-5D-5L valuation studies developed by the EuroQol group was adopted. Adult members of the general public were recruited from six geographic regions in Taiwan. In computer-based face-to-face interviews, each participant completed 10 composite time trade-off (C-TTO) tasks and 7 discrete choice experiment (DCE) tasks. The C-TTO and DCE data were modeled alone or in combination (using hybrid models) with additive models containing 20 dummy variables as main effects. The model performance was assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively (mainly logical consistency and prediction patterns).
   Results
   Of 1,073 recruited participants, 1,000 completed the study. Approximately 13% of observed utility values were -1 in the C-TTO tasks. The hybrid model, using all available data that assumed C-TTO response values left-censored at -1 and with main effects coefficients with logical consistency (monotonicity), was considered as the most appropriate model. The predicted utility ranged from -1.0259 to 1.
   Conclusions
   An EQ-5D-5L value set was developed for Taiwan using an established study protocol and a representative sample of the general population. This may facilitate health economic evaluations and decision making on resource allocation under Taiwan's national health insurance program in the future.

AB Purpose
   The literature lacks population-based epidemiologic studies on the incidence and risk factors for traumatic foot fractures. The purpose of this study was to update information concerning the incidence of foot fractures in China and to identify associated risk factors.
   Methods
   All the data on foot fractures were available from the China National Fracture Survey (CNFS), which was conducted between January and May in 2015. A total of 8 provinces, 24 urban cities and 24 rural counties in China were selected, using stratified random sampling and the probability proportional to size method. Individuals who had lived in their current residence for 6 months or longer were personally interviewed about any foot fracture that had occurred in 2014. Questionnaires were completed by every participant for data collection and quality control was accomplished by our research team members. The information included age, gender, height, weight, ethnic group, education, occupation, smoking, alcohol consumption, sleeping time per day, dietary habits and others. Fracture was initially identified by patients' self report and further confirmed by their providing medical records.
   Results
   A total of 512187 individuals participated in the CNFS. There were 201 patients with foot fractures in 2014. Mean age at the time of fracture was 45.4 years. The incidence rate of foot fractures was 39.2 (95%CI: 33.8-44.7)/100000/year. Fall and traffic accident were the most common causes for foot fractures and over 60% of these occurred at home or on the road. Alcohol consumption, history of previous fracture and average sleep time <7h/d were identified as independent risk factors for foot fractures both in males and females. Cigarette smoking was identified as a significant risk factor for foot fracture in males. For females, BMI >24 kg/m(2) was a risk factor whilst living in the west region was associated with a lower incidence rate of foot fracture.
   Conclusions
   The present study shows an incidence of 39.2/100000/year of foot fractures in China. Specific public health policies focusing on decreasing alcohol consumption and encouraging individuals to obtain sufficient sleep should be implemented. Females with a higher BMI should focus more on foot health care, especially in those with history of previous fracture.

AB BackgroundIn order to accurately measure and monitor levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary behaviour (SB) in older adults, cost efficient and valid instruments are required. To date, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) has not been validated with older adults (aged 60years plus) in the United Kingdom. The current study aimed to test the validity of the IPAQ in a group of older adults for both MVPA and SB.MethodsParticipants wore an Actigraph GT3X+ for seven consecutive days and following the monitor wear participants were asked to complete the IPAQ. Statistical analysis included: Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests; descriptive analyses; Spearman's rho coefficients; and Bland-Altman analyses.ResultsA sample of 253 older adults were recruited (mean age 71.8 years (SD 6.6) and 57% male). In total, 226 had valid accelerometer and IPAQ data for MVPA and 228 had valid data for SB. Results showed the IPAQ had moderate/acceptable levels of validity (r=.430-.557) for MVPA. For SB, there was substantial levels of validity on weekdays (r=.702) and fair levels of validity (r=.257) on weekend days. Bland-Altman analysis showed inherent measurement error with the majority of participants tending to under-report both MVPA and SB. Results showed the majority of older adult's under-report their level of MVPA and SB when completing the IPAQ and the linear relationship above the mean shows an error from under to over reporting as the mean increases.ConclusionsFindings from the current study suggest that the IPAQ is better implemented in larger surveillance studies comparing groups within or between countries rather than on an individual basis. Findings also suggest that the IPAQ validity scores could be strengthened by providing additional detail of types of activities older adults might do on a daily basis, improving recall; and it may also be necessary to provide an example of a daily break down of typical activities performed. This may enable older adults to more fully comprehend the amount of time they may spend active, sitting and/or lying during waking hours.

AB BackgroundMany children and young people experiencing mental health difficulties (MHD) do not access care, often due to inadequate identification. Schools have a unique potential to improve early identification; however, evidence is limited regarding the acceptability of school-based identification programmes. This study aimed to examine parents' beliefs about the acceptability of school-wide MHD screening in primary schools.MethodsWe collaborated with experts in school-based mental health to develop a questionnaire to measure parental attitudes toward school-wide MHD screening. The questionnaire contained 13 items relating to acceptability; three open-text boxes for comments on harms, benefits, and screening in general; and four questions that captured demographic information. Parents of children attending four primary schools in Cambridgeshire and Norfolk completed the questionnaire. We calculated counts, percentages, and means for each statement, and analysed responses to open-ended questions using content analysis.ResultsTwo hundred ninety parents returned the questionnaire across the four schools (61% response rate). In the 260 questionnaires analysed, a total of 254 parents (98%) believed that it is important to identify MHD early in life, and 251 (97%) believed that schools have an important role in promoting pupils' emotional health. The majority of parents (N=213; 82%) thought that screening would be helpful, although 34 parents (13%) thought that screening would be harmful. Perceived harms of screening included inaccurate identification, stigmatisation, and low availability of follow-up care. There was no clear consensus regarding how to obtain consent or provide feedback of screening results. There were no significant differences in responses according to ethnicity, gender, age, or school.ConclusionsResults suggest that most parents within the socio-demographic context of our study will accept MHD screening within primary schools, and that school-based screening is viable from the perspective of parents. The comments provided about potential harms as well as suggestions for programme delivery are relevant to inform the development and evaluation of acceptable and sustainable school-based identification models. Implementation and scale-up of such programmes will require further understanding of the perspectives of mental health professionals, school staff, and the general public as well as further evaluation against the established standards for identification programmes.

AB BackgroundGovernment alcohol monopolies were created in North America and Scandinavia to limit health and social problems. The Swedish monopoly, Systembolaget, reports to a health ministry and controls the sale of all alcoholic beverages with >3.5% alcohol/volume for off-premise consumption, within a public health mandate. Elsewhere, alcohol monopolies are being dismantled with evidence of increased consumption and harms. We describe innovative modelling techniques to estimate health outcomes in scenarios involving Systembolaget being replaced by 1) privately owned liquor stores, or 2) alcohol sales in grocery stores. The methods employed can be applied in other jurisdictions and for other policy changes.MethodsImpacts of the privatisation scenarios on pricing, outlet density, trading hours, advertising and marketing were estimated based on Swedish expert opinion and published evidence. Systematic reviews were conducted to estimate impacts on alcohol consumption in each scenario. Two methods were applied to estimate harm impacts: (i) alcohol attributable morbidity and mortality were estimated utilising the International Model of Alcohol Harms and Policies (InterMAHP); (ii) ARIMA methods to estimate the relationship between per capita alcohol consumption and specific types of alcohol-related mortality and crime.ResultsReplacing government stores with private liquor stores (Scenario 1) led to a 20.0% (95% CI, 15.3-24.7) increase in per capita consumption. Replacement with grocery stores (Scenario 2) led to a 31.2% (25.1-37.3%) increase. With InterMAHP there were 763 or+47% (35-59%) and 1234 or+76% (60-92%) more deaths per year, for Scenarios 1 and 2 respectively. With ARIMA, there were 850 (334-1444) more deaths per year in Scenario 1 and 1418 more in Scenario 2 (543-2505). InterMAHP also estimated 10,859 or+29% (22-34%) and 16,118 or+42% (35-49%) additional hospital stays per year respectively.ConclusionsThere would be substantial adverse consequences for public health and safety were Systembolaget to be privatised. We demonstrate a new combined approach for estimating the impact of alcohol policies on consumption and, using two alternative methods, alcohol-attributable harm. This approach could be readily adapted to other policies and settings. We note the limitation that some significant sources of uncertainty in the estimates of harm impacts were not modelled.

TI 'A world of competing sorrows': A mixed methods analysis of media
   reports of children with cancer abandoning conventional treatment
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PARENTS
AB Background
   We aimed to provide health practitioners greater insight into the public perception of traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) use. Our objectives were to identify news media reports of children abandoning conventional treatment for traditional and complementary medicine, analyze the thematic content of these news articles and estimate the tonality portrayed.
   Methods
   LexisNexis and Factiva were searched for terms related to cancer, children and T&CM. Inclusion criteria were children less than 18 years, in curative phase of treatment who attempted to abandon conventional therapy for any traditional and complementary medicine use. A secondary search was performed in LexisNexis, Factiva and Google News Archive with the names of children in identified cases. Qualitative analysis of news media reports was completed using a grounded theory approach. Quantitative analysis of article sentiment was performed using a linear support vector machine.
   Results
   Seventeen cases occurring between 2002 and 2016 were included. Five main themes were identified: treatment as torture, power imbalances, rights of parents, evidence versus beliefs and the rights of Indigenous Peoples. Sentiment analysis revealed an overall negative tone, as demonstrated by 73% of the articles.
   Interpretation
   A better understanding of factors that lead to abandonment of conventional therapy for traditional and complementary medicine as portrayed in the news media may help healthcare providers prevent the occurrence of these cases.

TI Push button replication: Is impact evaluation evidence for international
   development verifiable?
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID FINANCIAL EDUCATION
AB Objective
   Empirical research that cannot be reproduced using the original dataset and software code (replication files) creates a credibility challenge, as it means those published findings are not verifiable. This study reports the results of a research audit exercise, known as the push button replication project, that tested a sample of studies that use similar empirical methods but span a variety of academic fields.
   Methods
   We developed and piloted a detailed protocol for conducting push button replication and determining the level of comparability of these replication findings to original findings. We drew a sample of articles from the ten journals that published the most impact evaluations from low- and middle-income countries from 2010 through 2012. This set includes health, economics, and development journals. We then selected all articles in these journals published in 2014 that meet the same inclusion criteria and implemented the protocol on the sample.
   Results
   Of the 109 articles in our sample, only 27 are push button replicable, meaning the provided code run on the provided dataset produces comparable findings for the key results in the published article. The authors of 59 of the articles refused to provide replication files. Thirty of these 59 articles were published in journals that had replication file requirements in 2014, meaning these articles are non-compliant with their journal requirements. For the remaining 23 of the 109 articles, we confirmed that three had proprietary data, we received incomplete replication files for 15, and we found minor differences in the replication results for five.
   Conclusion
   The findings presented here reveal that many economics, development, and public health researchers are a long way from adopting the norm of open research. Journals do not appear to be playing a strong role in ensuring the availability of replication files.

TI Women's (health) work: A population-based, cross-sectional study of
   gender differences in time spent seeking health care in Malawi
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID HOUSEHOLD COSTS; SOUTH-AFRICA; SERVICES; MEN; MONEY
AB Background
   There has been a notable expansion in routine health care in sub-Saharan Africa. While heath care is nominally free in many contexts, the time required to access services reflects an opportunity cost that may be substantial and highly gendered, reflecting the gendered nature of health care guidelines and patterns of use. The time costs of health care use, however, have rarely been systematically assessed at the population-level.
   Methods
   Data come from the 2015 wave of a population-based cohort study of young adults in southern Malawi during which 1,453 women and 407 men between the ages of 21 and 31 were interviewed. We calculated the time spent seeking health care over a two-month period, dis-aggregating findings by men, recently-pregnant women, mothers with children under two years old, and "other women". We then extrapolated the time required for specific services to estimate the time that would be needed for each subpopulation to meet government recommendations for routine health services over the course of a year.
   Results
   Approximately 60% of women and 22% of men attended at least one health care visit during the preceding two months. Women spent six times as long seeking care as did men (t = -4.414, p<0.001), with an average 6.4 hours seeking care over a two-month period compared to 1 hour for men. In order to meet government recommendations for routine health services, HIV-negative women would need to spend between 19 and 63 hours annually seeking health care compared to only three hours for men. An additional 40 hours would be required of HIV-positive individuals initiating antiretroviral care.
   Conclusions
   Women in Malawi spend a considerable amount of time seeking routine health care services, while men spend almost none. The substantial time women spend seeking health care exacerbates their time poverty and constrains opportunities for other meaningful activities. At the same time, few health care guidelines pertain to men who thus have little interaction with the health care system. Additional public health strategies such as integration of services for those services frequently used by women and specific guidelines and outreach for men are urgently needed.

ID NORWALK VIRUS; DIVERSITY; OUTBREAK; PROTEIN; DOMAIN
AB BackgroundCanine noroviruses (CaNoVs) are classified into genogroups GIV, GVI, and GVII and have been detected in fecal samples from dogs since their first appearance in a dog with enteritis in Italy in 2007. CaNoVs may be a public health concern because pet animals are an integral part of the family and could be a potential reservoir of zoonotic agents. Nonetheless, there was no previous information concerning the epidemiology of CaNoV in South Korea. In the present study, we aimed to detect CaNoV antigens and to investigate serological response against CaNoV in dogs.ResultsIn total, 459 fecal samples and 427 sera were collected from small animal clinics and animal shelters housing free-roaming dogs in geographically distinct areas in South Korea. For the detection of CaNoV, RT-PCR was performed using target specific primers, and nucleotide sequences of CaNoV isolates were phylogenetically analyzed. Seroprevalence was performed by ELISA based on P domain protein. CaNoVs were detected in dog fecal samples (14/459, 3.1%) and were phylogenetically classified into the same cluster as previously reported genogroup GIV CaNoVs. Seroprevalence was performed, and 68 (15.9%) of 427 total dog serum samples tested positive for CaNoV IgG antibodies.ConclusionThis is the first study identifying CaNoV in the South Korean dog population.

   Outbreak; Solomon Islands; Pacific islands; DHIS2; Small island
   developing states; IHR (2005)
AB BackgroundSolomon Islands is one of the least developed countries in the world. Recognising that timely detection of outbreaks is needed to enable early and effective response to disease outbreaks, the Solomon Islands government introduced a simple syndromic surveillance system in 2011. We conducted the first evaluation of the system and the first exploration of a national experience within the broader multi-country Pacific Syndromic Surveillance System to determine if it is meeting its objectives and to identify opportunities for improvement.MethodsWe used a multi-method approach involving retrospective data collection and statistical analysis, modelling, qualitative research and observational methods.ResultsWe found that the system was well accepted, highly relied upon and designed to account for contextual limitations. We found the syndromic algorithm used to identify outbreaks was moderately sensitive, detecting 11.8% (IQR: 6.3-25.0%), 21.3% (IQR: 10.3-36.8%), 27.5% (IQR: 12.8-52.3%) and 40.5% (IQR: 13.5-65.7%) of outbreaks that caused small, moderate, large and very large increases in case presentations to health facilities, respectively. The false alert rate was 10.8% (IQR: 4.8-24.5%). Rural coverage of the system was poor. Limited workforce, surveillance resourcing and other upstream' health system factors constrained performance.ConclusionsThe system has made a significant contribution to public health security in Solomon Islands, but remains insufficiently sensitive to detect small-moderate sized outbreaks and hence should not be relied upon as a stand-alone surveillance strategy. Rather, the system should sit within a complementary suite of early warning surveillance activities including event-based, in-patient- and laboratory-based surveillance methods. Future investments need to find a balance between actions to address the technical and systems issues that constrain performance while maintaining simplicity and hence sustainability.

AB BackgroundUnhealthy foods are promoted heavily, through food company sponsorship of elite sport, resulting in extensive exposure among young adults who are avid sport spectators. This study explores the effects of sponsorship of an elite sporting event by: (A) non-food brands (control), (B) unhealthy food brands, (C) healthier food brands, or (D) an obesity prevention public health campaign on young adults' brand awareness, attitudes, image perceptions, event-sponsor fit perceptions, and preference for food sponsors' products.MethodsA between-subjects web-based experiment was conducted, consisting of four sponsorship conditions (A through D) featuring three product categories within each condition. Australian adults (N=1132) aged 18-24years were recruited via a national online panel. Participants viewed promotional videos and news stories about an upcoming international, multi-sport event (with sponsor content edited to reflect each condition), completed a distractor task, and then answered questions assessing the response variables. Regression analyses were conducted to test for differences by sponsorship condition on the respective outcome measures.ResultsCompared to the control condition, unhealthy food sponsorship promoted higher awareness of, and more favourable attitudes towards, unhealthy food sponsor brands. Unhealthy food sponsorship also led to greater perceived event-sponsor fit and transfer of perceptions of the sporting event to the unhealthy food sponsor brands, relative to the control group. Exposure to sponsorship for healthier foods produced similar sponsorship effects for healthier food sponsor brands, as well as prompting a significant increase in the proportion of young adults showing a preference for these products. Obesity prevention campaign sponsorship promoted higher campaign awareness and perceived event-sponsor fit, but did not impact food attitudes or preference for unhealthy versus healthier foods.ConclusionFindings suggest that restricting elite sport sponsorship to healthier food brands that meet set nutritional criteria could help promote healthier eating among young adults. Sporting organisations should be encouraged to seek sponsorship from companies who produce healthier food brands and government-funded social marketing campaigns.Clinical trial registrationAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) registration number ACTRN12618000368235.

AB BackgroundDiabetes is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Mexico and understudied among indigenous populations. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and identify correlates of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (Type 2 DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in a rural, indigenous community in Northwestern Mexico.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted in the community of San Quintin, Baja California, Mexico, among a sample of households. A total of 275 participants (18years old) underwent a questionnaire, physical examination, and serologic test. Prevalence and adjusted odds ratio (AOR), using logistic regression modeling, were estimated with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).ResultsThe prevalence of Type 2 DM and MetS was 21.8 and 53.1%, respectively. Meanstandard deviation (SD) age and body mass index of study participants was 35.8 +/- 13.0years and 28.7 +/- 5.6kg/m(2), respectively. Participants were 75% female and 60.7% self-identified as indigenous. Thirty-seven percent of adults had high blood pressure. After controlling for age, higher educational attainment had a protective effect on Type 2 DM (AOR=0.39; 95% CI 0.20, 0.77). Additionally, the presence of MetS was associated with being female (AOR=2.27; 95% CI 1.23, 4.14) and having lower educational attainment (AOR=0.62; 95% CI 0.37, 0.94).Conclusions The prevalence of Type 2 DM and MetS was high in this rural and indigenous population, and education was shown to play a critical role. These findings support the need for community-inclusive health-promoting interventions in rural communities.

AB BackgroundAlcohol and illicit drug use has been recognized as a growing problem among adolescents in Botswana. Little is known about factors affecting alcohol and drug use among Botswana's secondary school students. To aid the design and implementation of effective public health interventions, we sought to determine the prevalence of alcohol and drug use in secondary school students in urban and peri-urban areas of Botswana, and to evaluate risk and protective factors for substance use.MethodsWe performed a 72-item cross-sectional survey of students in 17 public secondary schools in Gaborone, Lobatse, Molepolole and Mochudi, Botswana. The World Health Organization's (WHO) Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) was used to define hazardous drinking behavior. Using Jessor's Problem Behavior Theory (PBT) as our conceptual framework, we culturally-adapted items from previously validated tools to measure risk and protective factors for alcohol and drug use. Between-group differences of risk and protective factors were compared using univariate binomial and multinomial-ordinal logit analysis. Relative risks of alcohol and drug use by demographic, high risks and low protections were calculated. Multivariate ordinal-multinomial cumulative logit analysis, multivariate nominal-multinomial logit analysis, and binominal logit analysis were used to build models illustrating the relationship between risk and protective factors and student alcohol and illicit drug use. Clustered data was adjusted for in all analyses using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) methods.ResultsOf the 1936 students surveyed, 816 (42.1%) reported alcohol use, and 434 (22.4%) met criteria for hazardous alcohol use. Illicit drug use was reported by 324 students (16.7%), with motokwane (marijuana) being the most commonly used drug. Risk factors more strongly associated with alcohol and drug use were reported alcohol availability, individual and social vulnerability factors, and poor peer modeling. Individual and social controls protections appear to mitigate risk of student alcohol and drug use.ConclusionsAlcohol and illicit drug use is prevalent among secondary school students in Botswana. Our data suggest that interventions that reduce the availability of alcohol and drugs and that build greater support networks for adolescents may be most helpful in decreasing alcohol and drug use among secondary school students in Botswana.

AB BackgroundThe number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in Norway is increasing due to immigration from countries with high TB prevalence and few studies have been conducted on general practitioners' (GPs) knowledge of TB in low incidence countries. The main purpose of this study was to explore knowledge, attitudes and practices of TB among Norwegian GPs using a modified Knowledge Attitude Practice (KAP) survey template.MethodsA cross-sectional survey of 30 questions was distributed by email using SurveyMonkey to GPs working in municipalities either with or without an asylum reception centre in Eastern Norway (GPwAS or GPw/oAS). The questionnaire assessed demographic data and had 14 questions on TB knowledge and 7 questions on attitudes and practices. Descriptive and inferential analysis of the data was carried out using SPSS 18.ResultsOne hundred ninety five GPs responded and 42% worked in a municipality with an asylum reception centre. There was no significant difference between the two GP groups in relation to demographic variables (all p-values >0.2). GPwAS were more experienced in diagnosing TB patients compared to GPw/oAS (63.4% vs 44.2%, p=0.008). There was no significant differences in participation in TB training between the two groups (8.5% vs 7.6%, p=0.71). The majority of GPs (69%) did not consider TB as a major public health threat and misconceptions of TB epidemiology were identified. Overall, 97 (49.7%) GPs had good TB knowledge level and good TB knowledge level was associated with experience in diagnosing TB patients (p=0.001) and recent TB training (p=0.015).ConclusionGaps in TB knowledge and awareness among GPs in Norway need to be addressed if GPs are to be more involved in TB management and prevention in the future. TB training had an effect on the GPs knowledge level and GPwAS had more experience with TB patients but our survey revealed no major differences in KAP between GPwAS and GPw/oAS.

AB BackgroundSingle disease payment program based on clinical pathway (CP-based SDP) plays an increasingly important role in reducing health expenditure in china and there is a clear need to explore the scheme from different perspectives. This study aimed at evaluating the effect of the scheme in rural county public hospitals within Anhui, a typical province of China,using uterine leiomyoma as an example.MethodsThe study data were extracted from the data platform of the New Rural Cooperative Medical Office of Anhui Province using stratified-random sampling. Means, constituent ratios and coefficients of variations were calculated and/or compared between control versus experiment groups and between different years.ResultsThe total hospitalization expenditure (per-time) dropped from 919.08274.92 USD to 834.91 +/- 225.29 USD and length of hospital stay reduced from 9.96 +/- 2.39days to 8.83 +/- 1.95days(P<0.01), after CP-based SDP had implemented. The yearly total hospitalization expenditure manifested an atypical U-shaped trend. Medicine expense, nursing expense, assay cost and treatment cost reduced; while the fee of operation and examination increased (P<0.05). The expense constituent ratios of medicine, assay and treatment decreased with the medicine expense dropped the most (by 4.4%). The expense constituent ratios of materials, ward, operation, examination and anesthetic increased,with the examination fee elevated the most (by 3.9%).The coefficient of variation(CVs) of treatment cost declined the most (-0.360); while the CV of materials expense increased the most (0.186).Conclusion There existed huge discrepancies in inpatient care for uterine leiomyoma patients. Implementation of CP-based SDP can help not only in controlling hospitalization costs of uterine leiomyoma in county-level hospitals but also in standardizing the diagnosis and treatment procedures.

AB BackgroundThe number of cases of Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is increasing in Europe. The described epidemic is mostly confined to HIV positive men who have sex with men (MSM). However, dissemination of LGV from HIV positive to HIV negative MSM could take place due to the implementation of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and subsequent possible decrease in condom use. We describe here the LGV epidemiology in Belgium before the PrEP-era, starting from 2011 up to the end of the first half of 2017.MethodsA descriptive analysis of the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of all LGV cases was performed. Fisher's exact test was used to compare symptomatic to asymptomatic patients. Logistic regression models were used to check for trends over time for: number of LGV cases, HIV status and symptoms.ResultsThe number of LGV cases rose by a factor four, from 21 in 2011 to 88 in 2016, and regression models showed a positive trend estimate of 14% increase per half year (p<0.001). LGV decreased among HIV positive cases (odds ratio (OR): 0.79, p<0.001) and increased among HIV negative cases (OR: 1.27, p<0.001). In addition, a rise in the number of asymptomatic LGV cases (6.7%) was observed (OR:1.39, p=0.047). Asymptomatic cases were also less likely to be HIV (p=0.046) or Hepatitis C positive (p=0.027).ConclusionsThe rise of LGV in HIV negative MSM has now been documented. If we aim to halt the epidemic in HIV negative MSM, future public health strategies should include LGV testing of all Chlamydia trachomatis positive samples from MSM.

ID TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; POSTCONCUSSION SYNDROME
AB BackgroundDespite concussion now being recognized as a public health priority in Canada, recent studiesincluding our 2012 survey of Canadian medical schoolshave revealed major gaps in concussion education at the undergraduate medical school level.MethodsWe re-surveyed all 17 Canadian medical schools using a questionnaire divided in two categories: (1) concussion-specific education (2) head injury education incorporating a concussion component to determine whether there have been any improvements in concussion education at the medical school level during the last five years. For each year of medical school, respondents were asked to provide the estimated number of hours and teaching format for each category.ResultsWe received replies from 13 of the 17 medical schools (76%). 11 of the 13 (85%) medical schools now reported providing concussion-specific education compared to 29% in our 2012 survey. The mean number of hours dedicated to category 1 learning in 2017 was 2.65h compared to 0.57 in 2012, and the mean number of hours of category2 increased to 7.5 from 1.54.ConclusionOur follow-up study reveals increased exposure to concussion-related teaching in Canadian medical schools during the last five years. Persistent deficiencies in a minority of schools are highlighted. These should be addressed by reiterating the importance of concussion education for undergraduate medical students and by developing clear concussion-specific objectives at the national licensure level.

AB Rabies is an ancient and neglected zoonotic disease caused by the rabies virus, a neurotropic RNA virus that belongs to the Rhabdoviridae family, genus Lyssavirus. It remains an important public health problem as there are cost and health concerns imposed by the current human post exposure prophylaxis therapy. The use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is therefore an attractive alternative. Rabies mostly affects people that reside in resource-limited areas where there are occasional failures in the cold-chain. These environmental changes may upset the stability of the mAbs. This study focused on mAbs 62-71-3 and E559; their structures, responses to freeze/thaw (F/T) and exposure to reactive oxygen species were therefore studied with the aid of a wide range of biophysical and in silico techniques in order to elucidate their stability and identify aggregation prone regions. E559 was found to be less stable than 62-71-3. The complementarity determining regions (CDR) contributed the most to its instability, more specifically: peptides (EIWD102)-E-99 and (92)ATSPYT(97) found in CDR3, Trp33 found in CDR1 and the oxidised Met34. The constant region "(158)SWNSGALTGHTFPAVL(175)" was also flagged by the special aggregation propensity (SAP) tool and F/T experiments to be highly prone to aggregation. The E559 peptides "(4)LQESGSVL(11) from the heavy chain and (4)LTQSPSSL(11) from the light chain, were also highly affected by F/T. These residues may serve as good candidates for mutation, in the aim to bring forward more stable therapeutic antibodies, thus paving a way to a more safe and efficacious antibody-based cocktail treatment against rabies.

AB Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) still represents a serious public health problem in Brazil due to the inefficiency of the control measures currently employed, that included early diagnosis and treatment of human cases, vector control, euthanasia of infected dogs and, recently approved in Brazil, treatment with Milteforam drug. Effective clinical management depend largely on early and unequivocal diagnosis, however, cross-reactivity have also been described in serological tests, especially when it refers to individuals from areas where Chagas' disease is also present. Thus, to discover new antigens to improve the current serological tests for VL diagnosis is urgently needed. Here, we performed an immunogenomic screen strategy to identify conserved linear B-cell epitopes in the predicted L. infantum proteome using the following criteria: i) proteins expressed in the stages found in the vertebrate host, amastigote stage, and secreted/excreted, to guarantee greater exposure to the immune system; ii) divergent from proteins present in other infectious disease pathogens with incidence in endemic areas for VL, as T. cruzi; iii) highly antigenic to humans with different genetic backgrounds, independently of the clinical stage of the disease; iv) stable and adaptable to quality-control tests to guarantee reproducibility; v) using statistical analysis to determine a suitable sample size to evaluate accuracy of diagnostic tests established by receiver operating characteristic strategy. We selected six predicted linear B-cell epitopes from three proteins of L. infantum parasite. The results demonstrated that a mixture of peptides (Mix IV: peptides 3+6) were able to identify VL cases and simultaneously able to discriminate infections caused by T. cruzi parasite with high accuracy (100.00%) and perfect agreement (Kappa index = 1.000) with direct methods performed by laboratories in Brazil. The results also demonstrated that peptide-6, Mix III (peptides 2+6) and I (peptides 2+3+6) are potential antigens able to used in VL diagnosis, represented by high accuracy (Ac = 99.52%, 99.52% and 98.56%, respectively). This study represents an interesting strategy for discovery new antigens applied to serologic diagnosis which will contribute to the improvement of the diagnosis of VL and, consequently, may help in the prevention, control and treatment of the disease in endemic areas of Brazil.

ID SECURITY; IOT
AB The Internet of Things (or IoT), which enables the networked interconnection of everyday objects, is becoming increasingly popular in many aspects of our lives ranging from entertainment to health care. While the IoT brings a set of invaluable advantages and opportunities with it, there is also evidence of numerous challenges that are yet to be resolved. This is certainly the case with regard to ensuring the cyber security of the IoT, and there are various examples of devices being hacked. Despite this evidence, little is known about the public perceptions of the opportunities and challenges presented by the IoT. To advance research in this direction, we mined the social media platform Twitter to learn about public opinion about the IoT. Analysing a longitudinal dataset of more than 6.7 million tweets, we reveal insights into public perceptions of the IoT, identifying big data analytics as the most positive aspect, whereas security issues are the main public concern on the negative side. Our study serves to highlight the importance of keeping IoT devices secure, and remind manufacturers that it is a concern that remains unresolved, at least insofar as the public believes.

ID HEALTH; RISK; CHOICE
AB BackgroundThe decision to initiate or maintain a healthy habit, such as physical activity involves a trade-off between a short-term cost, such as time and effort, which are commonly identified as barriers to physical activity, and a long-term health benefit. Research suggests that individual time preference may be associated with unhealthy behaviors. However, empirical evidence of this for physical activity is scant. This study investigated the relationship between time preference and physical activity, and how this might influence behavior change.MethodsEmployees (n=176; mean age 42.2years) who participated in a physical activity intervention were invited to take part in a behavioral economic field experiment. Two economic experiments, using multiple price lists and monetary trade-off tables involving real money choices, were conducted face-to-face with participants to measure the two components of time preference, namely present-bias and discount rate. Together with individual risk preferences, these three variables were jointly estimated by maximum likelihood. These three parameters were expressed as a linear function of the levels of physical activity while controlling for socio-demographic variables within the same maximum likelihood framework.ResultsThose who were present-biased and who had higher discount rates did significantly less physical activity than their patient and non present-biased counterparts. A 3% lower discount rate and 1.14 unit decrement in the present-bias parameter was associated with a 30min increase of physical activity per week. This negative association was more significant for certain sub-groups, such as younger and married adults and those with higher staff grade and those who have children. Participants who dropped out of the study earlier were more present-biased.ConclusionsResults demonstrated that discount rate and present-biasedness have a significant impact on physical activity levels. Such concepts have been largely overlooked and underutilized in physical activity interventions. Promising implications include 1) utilizing individuals' time preferences to better target interventions; 2) taking account of time preferences in the intervention design; 3) interventions attempting to correct for present-biasedness.

AB BackgroundLittle is known about people's river usage, a leading drowning location. This study examines alcohol consumption patterns of river users and their attitudes to drowning risk.MethodsA convenience sample of adult (18+ years) river users were surveyed at four river locations. The survey covered eight domains: demographics; river attendance frequency; frequency of engaging in water activities; drinking patterns; alcohol and water safety knowledge; alcohol and water safety attitudes; alcohol consumption; and Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC). For BAC, participants were asked to record time since their last alcoholic drink and were then breathalysed to record an estimate of their BAC. BAC was examined by BAC reading (negative, positive, 0.050%). Hazardous lifetime drinking levels were calculated and their impact on drowning risk evaluated. Univariate and chi square analysis (95% confidence interval) was conducted.ResultsSix hundred eighty four people participated (51.6% female; 49.0% aged 18-34years). Sixteen percent (15.9%) had a positive BAC (Mean+BAC=0.068%; SD0.08; Range=0.001-0.334%), with 7.2% 0.050% (Mean BAC 0.050% =0.132%; SD +/- 0.06). Those significantly more likely to record a BAC 0.050% at the river were: aged 18-34years, resided in inner regional and low socio-economic areas, visited the river in the afternoon, with friends, on days with higher maximum air temperatures, frequent river users (11+ times in the last 30days) and those who spend longer in the water (301+ minutes). River users who recorded a BAC 0.050% were more likely to self-report engaging in risky activities (i.e. diving into water of unknown depth and jumping into the river from height). River users on Australia day (a national public holiday) were significantly more likely to drink heavily (Mean BAC 0.05%=0.175%; SD +/- 0.09).Conclusions Despite males accounting for 85% of alcohol-related river drowning deaths, similar numbers of males and females were consuming alcohol at the river. This study has addressed a gap in knowledge by identifying river usage and alcohol consumption patterns among those at increased drowning risk. Implications for prevention include delivering alcohol-related river drowning prevention strategies to both males and females; at peak times including during hot weather, afternoons, public holidays and to river users who swim.

AB Dengue fever is known to be one of the most common arthropod-borne viral infectious diseases of public health importance. The disease is now endemic in more than 100 countries in Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean, Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific with an estimated two fifths of the world's population being at risk. The notable endemic viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) found in West Africa, including yellow fever, Lassa fever, Rift Valley fever, dengue fever and until recently Ebola have been responsible for most outbreaks with fatal consequences. These VHFs usually produce unclear acute febrile illness, especially in the acute phase of infection. In this study we detected the presence of 2 different serotypes (DENV-2 and DENV-3) of Dengue virus in 4 sera of 150 patients clinically suspected of Ebola virus disease during the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa with the use of serological and molecular test assays. Sequence data was successfully generated for DENV-3 and phylogenetic analysis of the envelope gene showed that the DENV-3 sequences had close homology with DENV-3 sequences from Senegal and India. This study documents molecular evidence of an indigenous Dengue fever viral infection in Ghana and therefore necessitates the need to have an efficient surveillance system to rapidly detect and control the dissemination of the different serotypes in the population which has the potential to cause outbreaks of dengue hemorrhagic fevers.

TI Correcting misinformation by health organizations during measles
   outbreaks: A controlled experiment
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article

   INFORMATION; COMMUNICATION; TWITTER; CRISIS; MEDIA; RECOMMENDATIONS
AB Background
   During epidemic crises, some of the information the public receives on social media is misinformation. Health organizations are required to respond and correct the information to gain the public's trust and influence it to follow the recommended instructions.
   Objectives
   (1) To examine ways for health organizations to correct misinformation concerning the measles vaccination on social networks for two groups: pro-vaccination and hesitant; (2) To examine the types of reactions of two subgroups (pro-vaccination, hesitant) to misinformation correction; and (3) To examine the effect of misinformation correction on these two subgroups regarding reliability, satisfaction, self-efficacy and intentions.
   Methods
   A controlled experiment with participants divided randomly into two conditions. In both experiment conditions a dilemma was presented as to sending a child to kindergarten, followed by an identical Facebook post voicing the children mothers' concerns. In the third stage the correction by the health organization is presented differently in two conditions: Condition 1 -common information correction, and Condition 2-recommended (theory-based) information correction, mainly communicating information transparently and addressing the public's concerns. The study included (n = 243) graduate students from the Faculty of Social Welfare and Health Sciences at Haifa University.
   Results
   A statistically significant difference was found in the reliability level attributed to information correction by the Health Ministry between the Control condition and Experimental condition (sig<0.001), with the average reliability level of the subjects in Condition 2 (M = 5.68) being considerably higher than the average reliability level of subjects in Condition 1 (4.64). A significant difference was found between Condition 1 and Condition 2 (sig<0.001), with the average satisfaction from the Health Ministry's response of Condition 2 subjects (M = 5.75) being significantly higher than the average satisfaction level of Condition 1 subjects (4.66). Similarly, when we tested the pro and hesitant groups separately, we found that both preferred the response presented in Condition 2.
   Conclusion
   It is very important for the organizations to correct misinformation transparently, and to address the emotional aspects for both the pro-vaccination and the hesitant groups. The pro-vaccination group is not a captive audience, and it too requires a full response that addresses the public's fears and concerns.

AB BackgroundVirus genome sequences, generated in ever-higher volumes, can provide new scientific insights and inform our responses to epidemics and outbreaks. To facilitate interpretation, such data must be organised and processed within scalable computing resources that encapsulate virology expertise. GLUE (Genes Linked by Underlying Evolution) is a data-centric bioinformatics environment for building such resources. The GLUE core data schema organises sequence data along evolutionary lines, capturing not only nucleotide data but associated items such as alignments, genotype definitions, genome annotations and motifs. Its flexible design emphasises applicability to different viruses and to diverse needs within research, clinical or public health contexts.ResultsHCV-GLUE is a case study GLUE resource for hepatitis C virus (HCV). It includes an interactive public web application providing sequence analysis in the form of a maximum-likelihood-based genotyping method, antiviral resistance detection and graphical sequence visualisation. HCV sequence data from GenBank is categorised and stored in a large-scale sequence alignment which is accessible via web-based queries. Whereas this web resource provides a range of basic functionality, the underlying GLUE project can also be downloaded and extended by bioinformaticians addressing more advanced questions.ConclusionGLUE can be used to rapidly develop virus sequence data resources with public health, research and clinical applications. This streamlined approach, with its focus on reuse, will help realise the full value of virus sequence data.

AB BackgroundCompetent managers are essential to the productivity of organisations and the sustainability of health systems. Effective workforce development strategies sensitive to the current competency development needs of health service managers (HSMs) are required.PurposeTo conduct a 360 degrees assessment of the competence of Australian HSMs to identify managerial competence levels, and training and development needs.MethodsAssessment of 93 middle-level HSMs from two public hospitals (n=25) and five community health services (CHS) (n=68), using the Managerial Competency Assessment Partnership (MCAP) framework and tool, conducted between 2012 and 2014 in Victoria, Australia.ResultsMean competency scores from both self- and combined colleagues' assessments indicated competence (scores greater than five but less than six) without guidance, but many HSMs have not had extensive experience. Around 12% of HSMs were unable to demonstrate the competency of evidence-informed decision-making' and 4% of HSMs were unable to demonstrate the competency of enabling and managing change'.ConclusionThe assessments confirmed managerial competence for the majority of middle-level HSMs from hospitals and CHS in Victoria, but found competency gaps. In addition, the assessment confirmed managerial strengths and weaknesses varied across management groups from different organisations. These findings suggest that the development of strategies to strengthen the health service management workforce should be multifaceted.Practice implicationsA focus on competency in performance evaluation and development using the MCAP framework and tool not only provides insights into performance of HSMs, but also has the potential to provide an organisation strategic advantage through succession planning and advancing managers' competence via learning needs analysis and targeted professional development. Linking competencies of HSMs to organisational objectives and strategies provides optimal use of the human resource capacity, improving the organisation's productivity and sustainability.

AB BackgroundThe United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Incarceration can increase HIV risk behaviors for individuals involved with the criminal justice system and may be a driver of HIV acquisition within the community.MethodsWe used an agent-based model to simulate HIV transmission in a sexual-contact network representing heterosexual African American men and women in Philadelphia to identify factors influencing the impact of male mass incarceration on HIV acquisition in women. The model was calibrated using surveillance data and assumed incarceration increased the number of sexual contacts and decreased HIV care engagement for men post-release. Incarceration of a partner increased the number of sexual contacts for women. We compared a counterfactual scenario with no incarceration to scenarios varying key parameters to determine what factors drove HIV acquisition in women.ResultsSetting the duration of male high-risk sexual behavior to two years post-release increased the number of HIV transmissions to women by more than 20%. Decreasing post-release HIV care engagement and increasing HIV acquisition risk attributable to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) also increased the number of HIV transmissions to women. Changing the duration of risk behavior for women, the proportion of women engaging in higher risk behavior, and the relative risk of incarceration for HIV-infected men had minimal impact.ConclusionThe mass incarceration of African American men can increase HIV acquisition in African American women on a population-level through factors including post-release high-risk behaviors, disruption of HIV care engagement among formerly incarcerated men, and increased STI prevalence. These findings suggest that the most influential points of intervention may be programs seeking to reduce male risk behaviors and promote HIV care engagement post-release, as well as STI testing and treatment programs for recently incarcerated men, as well as women with incarcerated partners.

ID POLICY; POLITICS; IMPACT; HARMS
AB BackgroundPublic health in England has opportunities to reduce alcohol-related harms via shaping the availability and accessibility of alcohol through the licensing function in local government. While the constraints of licensing legislation have been recognised, what is currently little understood are the day-to-day realities of how public health practitioners enact the licensing role, and how they can influence the local alcohol environment.MethodsTo address this, a mixed-methods study was conducted across 24 local authorities in Greater London between 2016 and 17. Data collection involved ethnographic observation of public health practitioners' alcohol licensing work (in eight local authorities); a survey of public health practitioners (n=18); interviews with licensing stakeholders (n=10); and analysis of public health licensing data from five local authorities. Fieldnotes and interview transcripts were analysed thematically, and quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics.ResultsResults indicated that some public health teams struggle to justify the resources required to engage with licensing processes when they perceive little capacity to influence licensing decisions. Other public health teams consider the licensing role as important for shaping the local alcohol environment, and also as a strategic approach for positioning public health within the council. Practitioners use different processes to assess the potential risks of licence applications but also the potential strengths of their objections, to determine when and how actions should be taken. Identifying the direct influence of public health on individual licences is challenging, but the study revealed how practitioners did achieve some level of impact, for example through negotiation with applicants.ConclusionsThis study shows public health impact following alcohol licensing work is difficult to measure in terms of reducing alcohol-related harms, which poses challenges for justifying this work amid resource constraints. However, there is potential added value of the licensing role in strategic positioning of public health in local government to influence broader determinants of health.

AB Introduction
   Despite the global rise in waterpipe tobacco smoking (WTS), the effectiveness of waterpipe tobacco health warnings remain understudied, especially in countries with high WTS rates. Egypt has been employing waterpipe tobacco labelling for a decade, however, their effectiveness is unknown. Our overall aim was to measure the effectiveness of pictorial health warnings (PHWs) on waterpipe tobacco packs (WTPs) through participant memory recall and to investigate whether they induced behavioural responses in waterpipe smokers and deterred uptake of WTS in non-smokers, examining the differentials of effectiveness among socio-demographic subgroups.
   Subjects and methods
   We conducted two surveys including 1490 adult current waterpipe smokers, 73 former waterpipe smokers, and 451 non-smokers in Cairo and a rural village in Egypt between 2015-2017. Participants who noticed PHWs on WTPs were asked questions about salience, communication of health risks, public support, cognitive processing, and self- reported behavioural responses (current waterpipe smokers: reduce consumption, forgo a smoke, quit attempts; former waterpipe smokers: quit; non-smokers: deter WTS initiation). Univariate and multivariable statistical analyses were performed.
   Results
   Participants' mean age was 35 years, mostly males (90.4%), waterpipe smokers (74.0%) and rural residents (59.3%). Approximately two-thirds of participants noticed PHWs on WTPs. Salience was significantly less among females, urban residents and participants with high literacy. More than three-quarters of participants reported that WTS health risks were communicated through the warnings. At least half of participants cognitively processed the warnings: 56.3% thought of the warnings when WTPs were out of sight; non-smokers understood the warnings (83.2%) and discussed them with others (90.3%) significantly more than current (76.0% and 72.5%, respectively) and former waterpipe smokers (81.0% and 61.9%, respectively). Participants reported that PHWs on WTPs motivated 58.5% of waterpipe smokers to think about quitting; 64.5% to reduce their consumption; 42.2% to forgo a smoke; 24.5% to attempt to quit; 57.1% of former waterpipe smokers to successfully quit; and 59.3% of non-smokers to remain smoke-free.
   Conclusions
   Findings suggest that inserting PHWs on WTPs is an effective waterpipe tobacco labelling policy. Countries with similarly high rates of WTS should consider adopting WTP PHWs within a comprehensive regulatory framework.

AB Background
   Anemia is a major public health problem that adversely affects pregnancy outcomes. The prevalence of anemia among pregnant women before conception is not well known in Tanzania. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, types, and risk factors of preconception anemia in women of reproductive age from a rural Tanzanian setting.
   Methods
   Trained field workers visited households to identify all female residents aged 18-40 years and invited them to the nearby health facility for screening and enrolment into this study. Baseline samples were collected to measure hemoglobin levels, serum ferritin, vitamin B-12, folate, C-reactive protein, alanine amino-transferase, the presence of malaria, HIV, and soil transmitted helminth infections. Anthropometric and socio-economic data were recorded alongside with clinical information of participants. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the adjusted odds ratios (AOR) for the factors associated with preconception anemia.
   Findings
   Of 1248 women enrolled before conception, 36.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 34.1-39.4) had anemia (hemoglobin <12 g/dL) and 37.6% (95% CI 34.9-40.4) had iron deficiency. For more than half of the anemic cases, iron deficiency was also diagnosed (58.8%, 95% CI 54.2-63.3). Anemia was independently associated with increased age (AOR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.07), malaria infection at enrolment (AOR 2.21, 95% CI 1.37-3.58) inflammation (AOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.21-2.60) and iron deficiency (AOR 4.68, 95% CI 3.55-6.17). The odds of anemia were reduced among women with increased mid-upper arm circumference (AOR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84-0.96).
   Conclusion
   Anemia among women of reproductive age before conception was prevalent in this rural setting. Increased age, iron deficiency, malaria infection and inflammation were significant risk factors associated with preconception anemia, whereas increased mid-upper arm circumference was protective against anemia. Interventions to ensure adequate iron levels as well as malaria control before conception are needed to prevent anemia before and during pregnancy and improve birth outcomes in this setting.

AB BackgroundDiabetes mellitus (DM) and periodontitis are very common and they interact with each other bidirectionally. This survey studied public primary care doctors on their awareness of this bidirectional relationship and their corresponding practice.MethodsAll Family Medicine doctors in Kowloon West Cluster, Hospital Authority were invited to a cross-sectional questionnaire survey. Results were analyzed statistically.ResultsOne hundred sixty-eight questionnaires were sent out, 143 were returned (response rate 85.1%). One hundred forty valid questionnaires were analyzed. Ninety-two percent of participants were aware of a relationship between DM and periodontal disease and this awareness was not associated with their years of experience, training status and personal oral health behavior. Ninety percent knew the effect of poor DM control on periodontal disease but only 76% were aware of the reverse effect of periodontal disease on DM. The difference was statistically significant (p=0.002, Related-samples Sign Test). In clinical practice on DM patients, only 5.7% asked dental history often (defined as 50% patients or above), 7.1% examined their mouths often and 12.1% recommended them to see dentist often. Logistic regression showed that awareness factors had no association with periodontology related clinical practice whereas clinical experience, being a Family Medicine specialist and personal interdental cleaning habit were linked with more positive practice.ConclusionsA high proportion of doctors in the study were aware of the relationship between DM and periodontal disease. However, this did not appear to influence their practice. Further measures among doctors and patients to promote comprehensive management of DM and periodontal disease should be explored.

   Diagnosis; Parakou; Benin
AB BackgroundLassa fever is one of the most lethal neglected tropical diseases in West Africa. It is a serious public health problem in this region of Africa where it is endemic in several countries. However, it remains a very little known disease by healthcare workers. The lack of specificity of its clinical manifestations makes its diagnosis difficult even in an epidemic context.Case presentationWe report here a confirmed case of Lassa fever whose diagnosis could not be suspected until 11 days after the symptomatology began. This case was recognized as a suspected case of Lassa fever in the Internal Medicine Department of the Regional and Teaching Hospital of Borgou due to the persistence of the fever and the worsening of the patient's clinical condition despite triple antibiotic therapy in general and especially due to the appearance of hemorrhages. Confirmation of the presence of Lassa fever virus by Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay on blood sample was obtained after his death despite late initiation of Ribavirin treatment.ConclusionThis case challenges Benin's health authorities on the need to facilitate access to diagnosis of viral hemorrhagic fevers and to train caregivers at all levels of the health system for better management of these diseases.

AB BackgroundProper logistics management information system in the supply chain improves health outcomes by maintaining accurate and timely information. The purpose of this study was to determine program drugs logistics management information system performance in public health facilities of East Wollega Zone, Oromia Regional State.MethodsA facility-based descriptive cross-sectional study design complemented with a qualitative method was conducted from April 01 to May 30, 2017. The quantitative data were gathered through reviewing logistics tools, a physical count of the selected program drugs, and interview of the pharmacy staffs. The evaluation of data quality was done on 134 RRFs and 805 bin-cards. A statistical package for social science version 20 was used to analyze the quantitative data. A chi-square test was performed to determine the association between dependent and independent variables. For the qualitative method, 11 face to face in-depth interviews were carried out, and the data were analyzed using thematic analysis technique.ResultsTwenty three selected public health facilities were included in the study of which 39% of them had an automated recording system. Concerning the data quality, 65% of RRFs and 79.1% of bin-cards were accurately filled, and 97.8% of the reports were found to be complete. Sixty-nine percent of the facilities had timely submitted their report to the higher level and the reporting rate of the facilities was determined to be 97%. A significant association was observed between RRF data accuracy and type of profession, X-2 (4, N=134) =35.0, P=0.040, trainings, X-2 (2, N=134) =37.12, P=0.001, e-LMIS, X-2 (2, N=134)=38.67, P=0.03, educational status, X-2 (2,N=134)=90.38, P=0.012, & supervision, X-2 (2, N=134)=94.03,P<0.001. Shortage of skilled human resources and poor commitment of the staffs were identified to be the major bottlenecks of logistics management information system performances.ConclusionsThe facilities' report submission rates were promising yet the quality of the reports need improvement. Poor data quality was more likely because of weak supportive supervision and the information system being managed by non-pharmacy professionals.

AB BackgroundThe World Health Organization has set an ambitious goal of eliminating viral hepatitis as a major public health threat by 2030. However, in sub-Saharan Africa, antiviral treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is virtually unavailable. Herein, we present the 1-year results of a pilot CHB treatment program in Ethiopia.MethodsAt a public hospital in Addis Ababa, CHB patients were treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate based on simplified eligibility criteria. Baseline assessment included liver function tests, viral markers, and transient elastography (Fibroscan). Changes in laboratory markers were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Adherence to therapy was measured by pharmacy refill data.ResultsOut of 1303 patients, 328 (25.2%) fulfilled the treatment criteria and 254 (19.5%) had started tenofovir disoproxil fumarate therapy prior to September 1, 2016. Of the patients who started therapy, 30 (11.8%) died within the first year of follow-up (28 of whom had decompensated cirrhosis), 9 (3.5%) self-stopped treatment, 7 (2.8%) were lost to follow-up, and 4 (1.6%) were transferred out. In patients who completed 12 months of treatment, the median Fibroscan value declined from 12.8 to 10.4 kPa (p <0.001), 172 of 202 (85.1%) patients with available pharmacy refill data had taken 95% of their tablets, and 161 of 189 (85.2%) patients with viral load results had suppressed viremia. Virologic failure (69 IU/mL) at 12 months was associated with high baseline HBV viral load (>1,000,000 IU/mL; adjusted OR 2.41; 95% CI 1.04-5.55) and suboptimal adherence (<95%; adjusted OR 3.43, 95% CI 1.33-8.88).ConclusionsThis pilot program demonstrated that antiviral therapy of CHB can be realized in Ethiopia with good clinical and virologic response. Early mortality was high in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, underscoring the need for earlier detection of hepatitis B virus infection and timely initiation of treatment, prior to the development of irreversible complications, in sub-Saharan Africa.Trial registrationNCT02344498 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier).

AB BackgroundResponsible gambling messages are widely used as a tool to enable informed choice and encourage appropriate gambling behavior. It is generally accepted that gamblers have different levels of risk of developing gambling problems and require various harm minimization tools and resources. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that responsible gambling messages should be customized and target specific groups of gamblers. This project aimed to understand hypothesized differences between cohorts of gamblers and receive qualitative feedback on archetypal targeted messages used to increase use of responsible gambling tools.MethodsFocus groups were held to test messages for specific cohorts: young adults (18-24years), seniors (60+ years), frequent gamblers (weekly), and gamblers of skill-based games (poker, sports betting).ResultsCohorts exhibited different preferences and responses to message archetypes. Seniors preferred messages about limit setting, whilst young adults and frequent gamblers responded to messages about their own play and expertise. Skill game gamblers were interested in the odds of winning and their own outcomes over time. However, all groups agreed that using positive, non-judgmental language in messaging is important.ConclusionsThis research makes an important contribution to the field by demonstrating that the wording of message content will likely influence the effectiveness of such messages differentially across various groups of gamblers for engaging gamblers in harm reduction tools. Guidance is provided on themes that can be used by public health marketers.

AB BackgroundThe occurrence of Salmonella enterica subspecies diarizonae serovar 61: k: 1, 5, (7) (SASd) and other Salmonella organisms in sheep in the German federal state of Thuringia was examined for the first time. Pooled faecal samples from 90 flocks located in this state were monitored.ResultsOnly SASd was detected in 74 (82.2%) out of the 90 sheep herds, other Salmonella serovars were not identified. A positive correlation was found between the flock size and the detection probability of SASd. Despite the agent's high prevalence, clinical symptoms of a disease exclusively due to SASd have not been observed. The SASd strains were characterised by macrorestriction analysis, antimicrobial testing and the biochemical profile. All strains were sensitive to 13 out of 14 antimicrobial substances and resistant to only sulfamethoxazole. The high number of macrorestriction groups of SASd strains indicated a low clonality of the serovar.ConclusionsData from sheep derived foods and public health data in Germany strongly suggest that the significance of SASd for public health is considerably lower than that of serovars belonging to Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica. For this reason and because of the low disease-causing potential of SASd in sheep, it is worthwile to consider a reduction in ongoing activities from combating to monitoring serovar 61: k: 1, 5, (7) in the sheep population.

TI An international analysis of the price and affordability of beer
SO PLOS ONE

ID CIGARETTE AFFORDABILITY; ALCOHOL AFFORDABILITY; CONSUMPTION; TRENDS;
   METAANALYSIS; DEMAND
AB Aims
   To apply methods for measuring the affordability of beer in a large cross section of countries, and to investigate trends in affordability of beer over time.
   Methods
   We use the Relative Income Price (RIP), which uses per capita GDP, to measure the affordability of beer in up to 92 countries from 1990 to 2016 (69 countries were included in 1990, however the survey has since grown to include 92 countries). In addition to affordability, we also investigate trends in the price of beer.
   Results
   While beer is, on average, similarly priced in high-income (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), it is significantly more affordable in HICs. There is significant variation in both price and affordability in HICs and in LMICs. Beer has become cheaper in real terms in 49% (18/37) of HICs and 43% (20/46) of LMICs. Beer became more affordable in most HICs (RIP: 30/37 or 81%) and LMICs (RIP: 42/44 or 95%)
   Conclusions
   The increased affordability over time of beer in most countries raises concerns about public health. Governments need to increase taxes on beer so that it becomes less affordable over time, in an effort to improve public health.

TI Sera selected from national STI surveillance system shows Chlamydia
   trachomatis PgP3 antibody correlates with time since infection and
   number of previous infections
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SEXUALLY-TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS; BRITAIN
AB Background
   Seroprevalence surveys of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) antibodies are promising for estimating age-specific CT cumulative incidence, however accurate estimates require improved understanding of antibody response to CT infection.
   Methods
   We used GUMCAD, England's national sexually transmitted infection (STI) surveillance system, to select sera taken from female STI clinic attendees on the day of or after a chlamydia diagnosis. Serum specimens were collected from laboratories and tested anonymously on an indirect and a double-antigen ELISA, both of which are based on the CT-specific Pgp3 antigen. We used cross-sectional and longitudinal descriptive analyses to explore the relationship between seropositivity and a) cumulative number of chlamydia diagnoses and b) time since most recent chlamydia diagnosis.
   Results
   919 samples were obtained from visits when chlamydia was diagnosed and 812 during subsequent follow-up visits. Pgp3 seropositivity using the indirect ELISA increased from 57.1% (95% confidence interval: 53.2-60.7) on the day of a first-recorded chlamydia diagnosis to 89.6% (95%CI: 79.3-95.0) on the day of a third or higher documented diagnosis. With the double-antigen ELISA, the increase was from 61.1% (95%CI: 53.2-60.7) to 97.0% (95%CI: 88.5-99.3). Seropositivity decreased with time since CT diagnosis on only the indirect assay, to 49.3% (95%CI: 40.9-57.7) two or more years after a first diagnosis and 51.9% (95%CI: 33.2-70.0) after a repeat diagnosis.
   Conclusion
   Seropositivity increased with cumulative number of infections, and decreased over time after diagnosis on the indirect ELISA, but not on the double-antigen ELISA. This is the first study to demonstrate the combined impact of number of chlamydia diagnoses, time since diagnosis, and specific ELISA on Pgp3 seropositivity. Our findings are being used to inform models estimating age-specific chlamydia incidence over time using serial population-representative serum sample collections, to enable accurate public health monitoring of chlamydia.

TI Multimorbidity patterns in high-need, high-cost elderly patients
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PRIMARY-CARE; OLDER-ADULTS; DISEASE; HEALTH; GUIDELINES
AB Introduction
   Patients with complex health care needs (PCHCN) are individuals who require numerous, costly care services and have been shown to place a heavy burden on health care resources. It has been argued that an important issue in providing value-based primary care concerns how to identify groups of patients with similar needs (who pose similar challenges) so that care teams and care delivery processes can be tailored to each patient subgroup. Our study aims to describe the most common chronic conditions and their combinations in a cohort of elderly PCHCN.
   Methods
   We focused on a cohort of PCHCN residing in an area served by a local public health unit (the "Azienda ULSS4-Veneto") and belonging to Resource Utilization Bands 4 and 5 according to the ACG System. For each patient we extracted Expanded Diagnosis Clusters, and combined them with information available from Rx-MGs diagnoses. For the present work we focused on 15 diseases/disorders, analyzing their combinations as dyads and triads. Latent class analysis was used to elucidate the patterns of the morbidities considered in the PCHCN.
   Results
   Five disease clusters were identified: one concerned metabolic-ischemic heart diseases; one was labelled as neurological and mental disorders; one mainly comprised cardiac diseases such as congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation; one was largely associated with respiratory conditions; and one involved neoplasms.
   Conclusions
   Our study showed specific common associations between certain chronic diseases, shedding light on the patterns of multimorbidity often seen in PCHCN. Studying these patterns in more depth may help to better organize the intervention needed to deal with these patients.

TI Laboratory strains of Bacillus anthracis exhibit pervasive alteration in

AB The spore forming pathogen Bacillus anthracis is the etiologic agent of anthrax in humans and animals. It cycles through infected hosts as vegetative cells and is eventually introduced into the environment where it generates an endospore resistant to many harsh conditions. The endospores are subsequently taken up by another host to begin the next cycle. Out-breaks of anthrax occur regularly worldwide in wildlife and livestock, and the potential for human infection exists whenever humans encounter infected animals. It is also possible to encounter intentional releases of anthrax spores, as was the case in October 2001. Consequently, it is important to be able to rapidly establish the provenance of infectious strains of B. anthracis. Here, we compare protein expression in seven low-passage wild isolates and four laboratory strains of B. anthracis grown under identical conditions using LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis. Of the 1,023 total identified proteins, 96 had significant abundance differences between wild and laboratory strains. Of those, 28 proteins directly related to sporulation were upregulated in wild isolates, with expression driven by Spo0A, CodY, and AbrB/ScoC. In addition, we observed evidence of changes in cell division and fatty acid biosynthesis between the two classes of strains, despite being grown under identical experimental conditions. These results suggest wild B. anthracis cells are more highly tuned to sporulate than their laboratory cousins, and this difference should be exploited as a method to differentiate between laboratory and low passage wild strains isolated during an anthrax out-break. This knowledge should distinguish between intentional releases and exposure to strains in nature, providing a basis for the type of response by public health officials and investigators.

AB BackgroundFrailty represents a public health priority and an increasingly prevalent condition in the ageing population. It is seen as reflecting an interaction among individual factors and a range of environmental elements. This study aims to examine the association between frailty and individual factors, physical and social environments among Chinese older people.MethodsThe data were from the Shanghai Healthy City Survey in 2017, which sampled 2559 older people aged 60years from 67 neighbourhoods. The FRAIL scale was used to assess frailty, and social and physical environments were assessed using validated and psychometrically tested instruments. Individual factors included age, gender, education, employment, marital status, smoking, drinking, physical exercise, organization participation, self-rated health and psychological well-being. A multilevel analysis was conducted to examine whether physical and social environments were associated with frailty.ResultsThe prevalence of pre-frailty and frailty were 39.5 and 16.9%, respectively. The prevalence of frailty increased with age from 14.6% (60-64years) to 26.5% (75years). After adjusting for age and/or gender, older age, women, and those with low education, alcohol dependence, physical inactivity, poor self-rated health, or psychological disorders had a higher prevalence of frailty. The multilevel analysis indicated that after controlling for individual covariates, compared to the 1st quartile of aesthetic quality, the odds ratio (OR) of frailty for the 4th quartile was 0.65 (0.47-0.89); compared to the 1st quartile of walking environment, the OR of frailty for the 4th quartile was 0.43 (0.19-0.95); compared to the 1st quartile of social cohesion, the OR of frailty for the 4th quartile was 0.73 (0.54-0.99); compared to the 1st quartile of social participation, the ORs of frailty for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th quartiles were 0.76 (0.59-0.97), 0.59 (0.45-0.77) and 0.59 (0.45-0.77), respectively.ConclusionsFrailty is a highly prevalent health condition among the aged population in China. Healthcare should focus on frail elderly who are older age, women, those with low education, and those with mental health problems. It may decrease frailty among Chinese older people to encourage social participation and healthy behaviours and to build aesthetic, walkable and cohesive neighbourhoods.

AB BackgroundGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a of the major public health issues in Asia. The present study aimed to determine the prevalence of, and risk factors for GDM in Asia via a systematic review and meta-analysis.MethodsWe systematically searched PubMed, Ovid, Scopus and ScienceDirect for observational studies in Asia from inception to August 2017. We selected cross sectional studies reporting the prevalence and risk factors for GDM. A random effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of GDM and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).ResultsEighty-four studies with STROBE score14 were included in our analysis. The pooled prevalence of GDM in Asia was 11.5% (95% CI 10.9-12.1). There was considerable heterogeneity (I-2>95%) in the prevalence of GDM in Asia, which is likely due to differences in diagnostic criteria, screening methods and study setting. Meta-analysis demonstrated that the risk factors of GDM include history of previous GDM (OR 8.42, 95% CI 5.35-13.23); macrosomia (OR 4.41, 95% CI 3.09-6.31); and congenital anomalies (OR 4.25, 95% CI 1.52-11.88). Other risk factors include a BMI 25kg/m(2) (OR 3.27, 95% CI 2.81-3.80); pregnancy-induced hypertension (OR 3.20, 95% CI 2.19-4.68); family history of diabetes (OR 2.77, 2.22-3.47); history of stillbirth (OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.68-3.40); polycystic ovary syndrome (OR 2.33, 95% CI1.72-3.17); history of abortion (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.54-3.29); age25 (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.96-2.41); multiparity 2 (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.24-1.52); and history of preterm delivery (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.21-3.07).ConclusionWe found a high prevalence of GDM among the Asian population. Asian women with common risk factors especially among those with history of previous GDM, congenital anomalies or macrosomia should receive additional attention from physician as high-risk cases for GDM in pregnancy.Trial registrationPROSPERO (2017: CRD42017070104).

AB BackgroundNowadays, because of the huge economic burden on society causing by obesity and diabetes, they turn into the most serious public health challenges in the world. To reveal the close and complex relationships between diabetes, obesity and other diseases, search the effective treatment for them, a novel model named as representative latent Dirichlet allocation (RLDA) topic model is presented.ResultsRLDA was applied to a corpus of more than 337,000 literatures of diabetes and obesity which were published from 2007 to 2016. To unveil those meaningful relationships between diabetes mellitus, obesity and other diseases, we performed an explicit analysis on the output of our model with a series of visualization tools. Then, with the clinical reports which were not used in the training data to show the credibility of our discoveries, we find that a sufficient number of these records are matched directly. Our results illustrate that in the last 10years, for obesity accompanying diseases, scientists and researchers mainly focus on 17 of them, such as asthmore broad scope of 26 diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, heart disease and so forth; for both of thema, gastric disease, heart disease and so on; for the study of diabetes mellitus, it features a m, there are 15 accompanying diseases, listed as following: adrenal disease, anxiety, cardiovascular disease, depression, heart disease, hepatitis, hypertension, hypothalamic disease, respiratory disease, myocardial infarction, OSAS, liver disease, lung disease, schizophrenia, tuberculosis. In addition, tumor necrosis factor, tumor, adolescent obesity or diabetes, inflammation, hypertension and cell are going be the hot topics related to diabetes mellitus and obesity in the next few years.ConclusionsWith the help of RLDA, the hotspots analysis-relation discovery results on diabetes and obesity were achieved. We extracted the significant relationships between them and other diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, heart disease and tumor. It is believed that the new proposed representation learning algorithm can help biomedical researchers better focus their attention and optimize their research direction.

AB Anemia is regarded as major public health problem among adolescents in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) but there is limited primary data in many countries, including Nepal. This study investigated the prevalence and correlates of anemia in a nationally representative sample of adolescents within the 2014 National Adolescent Nutrition Survey in Nepal. A total of 3780 adolescents aged 10 to 19 years were selected from a cross-sectional survey through multi-stage cluster sampling. Structured interviews, anthropometric measurements and hemoglobin assessments of capillary blood were obtained. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were undertaken to compute the Adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) for socio-demographic, behavioral and cluster characteristics. The overall prevalence of anemia was 31% (95%CI: 28.2, 33.5), 38% (95%CI: 34.0, 41.8) in female and 24% (95%CI: 20.6, 27.1) in male. The likelihood of anemia was significantly higher among older adolescents (aOR 1.75, 95%CI: 1.44,2.13), females (aOR 2.02; 95%CI: 1.57, 2.60), among those who walk barefoot (aOR 1.78, 95%CI: 1.08, 2.94), and those residing in the Terai (aOR 1.80, 95%CI: 1.18, 2.77). Food consumption from more than four food groups (aOR 0.71, 95%CI: 0.57, 0.88) was protective against anemia. In conclusion, anemia is common in Nepali adolescents. Efforts to improve the nutritional status of this high-risk age group require nutrition that focus on eating habits, sanitation, iron supplementation and the treatment of hookworm infection.

AB BackgroundFamily-centered care has been receiving increased attention during the last decades and health professionals recognize family satisfaction with care as an important health indicator. The Empowerment of Parents in The Intensive Care-Neonatology (EMPATHIC-N) is a newly developed, yet empirically reliable and valid measure for the assessment of parental satisfaction with the care provided by Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU). The present study aims to present the Greek version of the EMPATHIC-N and to confirm its factorial structure.MethodsThe EMPATHIC-N was translated in Greek using a forward-backward translation and was piloted before use. A sample of 256 families receiving intensive care at the NICU of Archbishop Makarios III Public Hospital in Cyprus which is the only NICU in Cyprus, participated in the validation study of the EMPATHIC-N. Confirmatory factor analyses were performed using SPSS and AMOS 24.0.ResultsThe Greek version of the EMPATHIC-N had good psychometric characteristics (Cronbach's alpha=.87). The CFAs for the separate subscales of professionalism, organization, information, parental involvement and intervention for the EMPATHIC-N showed that all five subscales represented five distinct components of parental satisfaction with care. The CFA of the general instrument supported that a second-order model with a higher-order factor reflecting the organizational structure (professionalism, intervention and organization loaded on this factor) fitted the data best [2 (259)=405.332, p<.001, LI=.887, CFI=.903, RMSEA=.065 (90% CI .058, .073), SRMR=.0597].ConclusionsEMPATHIC-N is a valid and reliable measure for the assessment of parental satisfaction with neonatal care in a Greek-Cypriot context. The organizational dimension of the NICUs is an important component with specific research and clinical implications for the enhancement of parental satisfaction with care.

AB BackgroundFamily physicians are in frequent contact with patients, and their contribution to oral health promotion programs could be utilized more effectively. We implemented an oral health care (OHC) educational seminar for physicians and evaluated its impact on their knowledge retention in OHC.MethodsWe conducted an educational trial for primary care physicians (n=106) working in Public Health Centers in Tehran city. We launched a self-administered questionnaire about pediatric dentistry, general dental, and dentistry-related medical knowledge and backgrounds. Physicians in intervention group A (n=38) received an educational intervention (Booklet, Continuous Medical Education (CME), and Pamphlet), and those in group B (n=32) received only an OHC pamphlet. Group C (n=36) served as the control. A post-intervention survey followed four months later to measure the difference in the physicians' knowledge; the Chi-square test, ANOVA and linear regression analysis served for statistical analysis.ResultsThe intervention significantly increased the physicians' oral health knowledge scores in all three domains and their total knowledge score (p<0.001). Those physicians who had lower knowledge scores at the baseline showed a higher increase in their post-intervention knowledge. The models showed no associations between the background variables and the knowledge change.ConclusionThe primary care physicians' OHC knowledge improved considerably after an educational seminar with a reminder. These findings suggest that OHC topics should be included in physicians' CME programs or in their curriculum to promote oral health, especially among non-privileged populations.

AB BackgroundThis study investigated the treatment outcomes, and factors affecting the outcomes, of new tuberculosis (TB) patients in Busan, South Korea.MethodsWe retrospectively analysed the citywide TB registry data (collected for the Korean National TB Surveillance System) of new TB patients registered in Busan from January 2014 to December 2015.ResultsA total of 4732 patients were included in this study (mean age, 52.519.9years; 58.4% male). The overall treatment success rate was 83.9% (cured, 20.2%; completed, 63.7%); 8.0% of patients died, and 3.6% were lost to follow-up. In multivariate analyses, a higher rate of loss to follow-up was associated with foreign nationality, registered as TB-positive at least twice, and being in Q4 (fourth quintile) or Q5 (fifth quintile) of the regional deprivation index. Conversely, a lower rate of loss to follow-up was associated with female gender, smear-positive for pulmonary TB (PTB), and the treatment outcome being reported by a public health centre. Higher mortality was associated with old age ( 75years), smear-positive PTB, treatment outcome being reported by the hospital, and being registered as TB-positive twice. Lower mortality was associated with female gender, treatment outcome being reported by a public health centre or clinic, and Q5 of the regional deprivation index.Conclusions Treatment outcomes of new TB patients were sub-optimal in Busan. TB control programs should maintain close monitoring and provide greater socioeconomic support to patients at high risk of poor treatment outcomes.

AB BackgroundHerbal medicines in pregnancy are increasingly used worldwide with prevalence of up to 67%. Although this popularity is mainly because of the common belief that these medicines are safe, recent reports suggest that several herbal medicines are potentially harmful to mother and fetus if used in pregnancy.MethodsThis cross-sectional study was conducted in July and August of year 2017, at maternity wards of two public hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Postpartum women were interviewed via the structured questionnaire to collect information regarding socio-demographic and health characteristics, patterns of herbal medicines used in the previous pregnancy, and outcome of pregnancy.ResultsTwo hundred forty-three postpartum women participated in the study, with 70% of them using at least one modality of herbal medicines in previous pregnancy. Ginger, black seed, lemon tea, prune, and mustard oil were most commonly used herbal medicines. Herbal medicines were mostly used for pregnancy-related symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and cold. Fifteen (8.8%) herbal medicine users reported side effects.ConclusionsThis study highlights popularity of herbal medicines during pregnancy in Bangladesh. Previous herbal medicine users and unemployed women turned significantly more to herbal medicines during pregnancy. Reports of side effects and use of some potentially harmful modalities warrant awareness regarding proper use of herbal medicines in pregnancy and its pharmacovigilance.

AB BackgroundHip fractures among older adults are a major public health problem in many countries. Hip fractures are associated with expensive health care treatments, and serious adverse effects on patients' health and quality-of-life. In this paper, we estimate the effect of a community-based hip fracture prevention program that was initiated in 16 Norwegian municipalities in 2007. Specifically, the participating municipalities implemented one or more of the following interventions: exercise programs for older adults, information and education campaigns to communicate how to effectively reduce falls to care workers and older adults, and preventive home safety assessment and modification help services.MethodsWe used a difference-in-difference design, and identified control municipalities by matching on pre-intervention trends in the outcome. The outcome measure was the incidence of hip-fractures among older adults (65years).ResultsWe found no statistically significant effects of the implemented program on the incidence of hip fractures, on average, in older subgroups (80years) or in municipality-specific analyses.ConclusionsIt is unclear whether the interventions managed to achieve a change in hip fracture rates at the population level.

AB BackgroundMen who have sex with men (MSM) are at high risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and sexually transmitted infection (STI) in China. Inadequate clinical services and poor clinical competency among physicians are major barriers to improving the sexual health of MSM. This study aims to understand physician clinical competency in providing MSM health services in China.MethodsWe conducted an online cross-sectional survey among Chinese physicians who have seen male patients for STI complaints in the past year. We obtained information on individual demographics, clinical practice, attitudes toward MSM, and interest in contributing to MSM clinical services. We defined an MSM-competent physician as one who asked male patients about sexual orientation, sexual practices, and recommended HIV/ STI testing during a clinic visit. We conducted multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with MSM competency.ResultsIn total, 501 physicians completed the survey. The most common subspecialties were dermatovenereology (33.1%), urology (30.1%), and general medicine (14.4%). Roughly half (n=267, 53.3%) reported seeing MSM in the past 12months. Among physicians who saw MSM in the past 12months, 60.3% (n=161) met criteria as MSM-competent physicians, and most (n=234, 87.6%) MSM-competent physicians reported positive or neutral attitudes towards MSM. Over 60% of all physicians were willing to participate in activities for improving MSM services, such as training and being on a list of physicians willing to serve MSM. MSM-competent physicians showed no sociodemographic differences compared with non MSM-competent physicians. MSM-competent physicians were more willing to have their medical institution named on a public clinic list capable of serving MSM (aOR: 1.70, 95%CI: 1.01-2.86) and being on a public physician list capable of serving MSM (aOR: 1.77, 95%CI: 1.03-3.03).ConclusionsMSM-competent physicians included a broad range of individuals that practiced in diverse clinical settings. Most physicians were interested in improving and expanding MSM clinical services, despite having neutral attitudes toward same-sex behavior. Future interventions should focus on developing MSM clinical competency and expanding services that meet the needs of MSM.

AB The UK is currently facing an inactivity crises, with 1 in 5 children currently meeting physical activity guidelines (Health Survey for England, Children's Health, 2016). To combat this growing problem there has been increased interest in promoting exercise and healthy lifestyle advise to patients as a method for improving public health. In line with this, the specialty of Sports and Exercise Medicine (SEM) has been gaining momentum and is now a recognised specialty with a higher specialist training programme. This postgraduate speciality aims to produce doctors who are experts in exercise and musculoskeletal medicine. Increasing numbers of NHS departments are employing SEM doctors to better manage musculoskeletal (MSK) issues and prescribe exercise (Morrissey et. al, Muscles Ligaments Tendons J 3:190-195, 2013). In keeping with this increased opportunity for SEM in postgraduate training, we believe that we should not forget that SEM should not be exclusive to postgraduates and there is increasing interest and need for teaching to medical students (Cullen et al, Br J Sports Med 34:244-245, 2000). This article provides an overview to students and clinicians into the current state of undergraduate SEM education in the UK, and highlights the importance of incorporating SEM into the medical curricula.

AB BackgroundKano is one of the high-risk states for polio transmission in Northern Nigeria. The state reported more cases of wild polioviruses (WPVs) than any other state in the country. The Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey of 2013 indicated that OPV3 coverage in the routine immunization (RI) programmewas 57.9%. Additionally, serial polio seroprevalence studies conducted from 2011 to 2015 in the eightmetropolitan LGAs indicated low immunity levels against all three polio serotypes in children below one year. Areas with sub-optimal RI coverage such as Kanothat fail to remove all tOPV during the tOPV-bOPV switchwill be at increased risk of VDPV2 circulation.MethodsWe assessed the impact of political leadership engagement in mobilizing other stakeholders on the outcomes of the bOPV-tOPV switch in Kano State from February to May 2016 using nationally-selected planning and outcome indicators.ResultsA total of 670 health facilities that provide RI services were assessed during the pre-switch activities. Health workers were aware of the switch exercise in 520 (95.1%) of the public health facilities assessed. It was found that health workers knew what to do should tOPV be found in any of the 521 (95.2%)public health facilities assessed. However, there was a wide disparity between the public and private health practitioners' knowledge on basic concepts of the switch.There was 100% withdrawal of tOPV from the state and the seven zonal cold stores. Unmarked tOPVwas found in the cold chain system in 2 (4.5%) LGAs. Only one health facility (0.8%) had tOPV in the cold chain. No tOPVwas identified outside the cold chain without the Do not use sticker in any of the health facilities.ConclusionThe engagement of the political leadership to mobilize other key stakeholders facilitated successful implementation of the tOPV-bOPVswitch exercise and provided opportunity to strengthen partnerships with the private health sector in Kano State.

DE Nomadic population; Transboundary; Poliomyelitis; One-health
ID HEALTH
AB BackgroundNomadic populations have a considerably higher risk of contracting a number of diseases but, despite the magnitude of the public health risks involved, they are mostly underserved with few health policies or plans to target them. Nomadic population movements are shown to be a niche for the transmission of diseases, including poliomyelitis. The nomadic routes traverse the northern states of Nigeria to other countries in the Lake Chad subregion. As part of the February 2016 polio supplemental immunization activity (SIA) plans in Bauchi state, a review of nomadic routes and populations identified a nomadic population who originated from outside the international borders of Nigeria. This study describes the engagement process for a transboundary nomadic population and the interventions provided to improve population immunity among them while traversing through Nigeria.MethodsThis was an intervention study which involved a cross-sectional mixed-method (quantitative and qualitative) survey. Information was collected on the nomadic pastoralists entry and exit points, resting points, and health-seeking behavior using key informant interviews and semistructured questionnaire. Transit vaccination teams targeted the groups with oral polio vaccines (OPVs) and other routine antigens along identified routes during the months of February to April 2016. Mobile health teams provided immunization and other child and maternal health survival interventions.ResultsA total of 2015 children aged under 5years were vaccinated with OPV, of which 264 (13.1%) were zero-dose during the February 2016 SIAs while, in the March immunization plus days (IPDs), 1864 were immunized of which 211 (11.0%) were zero-dose. A total of 296 children aged under 1year old were given the first dose of pentavalent vaccine (penta 1), while 119 received the third dose (penta 3), giving a dropout rate of 59.8%.ConclusionsNomadic pastoralists move across international borders and there is a need for transboundary policies among the countries in the Lake Chad region to improve population immunity and disease surveillance through a holistic approach using the One-health concept.

DE Directly observed polio vaccination; Incentives; Supervision; And
   compliance
AB BackgroundThe declaration of poliomyelitis eradication as a programmatic emergency for global public health by the 65th World Health Assembly in 2012 necessitated innovations and strategies to achieve results. Review of the confirmed polio cases in 2013 showed that most of the cases were from non-compliant households, where parents connived with vaccinators to finger mark the children without actually vaccinating the children with oral polio vaccine or children were absent from home at the time of the visit of vaccinators.MethodsWe used pre-post design to quantify the outcomes of directly observed vaccination in 90 local government areas from 12 northern Nigeria states at very high risk of polio transmission.The strategy is an intervention, vaccinating children under the direct supervision of an independent supervisor to ensure compliance. Attractive incentives (pluses) were used to make parents willingly submit their children for vaccination or directly attract children to the vaccination teams or post as part of this strategy.ResultsThere was a steady increase in population immunity in all the 90 DOPV implementing LGAs since the introduction of DOPV in 2013. The number of states in which >90% of children received >4 OPV doses increased from 7 in 2013 to 11 states by July 2016.Yobe state reported the highest proportional increase from 75 to 99% by July 2016 (22% increase), while Kano state reported 17% increase, from 82 to 99% by July 2016.ConclusionDirectly observed polio vaccination strategy improved uptake of polio vaccines and population immunity in high-risk areas for polio transmission.

TI Institutionalizing documentation for WHO Nigeria country office
   visibility and improved donor relations, 2013-2016
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH

DT Article
DE Institutionalizing documentation; WHO Nigeria country office visibility;
   Improved donor relations
ID ACCOUNTABILITY; TRANSPARENCY
AB BackgroundThe mandate and unique experience of the World Health Organization (WHO) globally, enables over 190 countries, Nigeria inclusive, to depend on the technical support provided by the organization to define and mitigate the threats to public health. With other emerging health actors competing for scarce donors' resources, the demand for visibility has invariably equaled expectations on WHO's expertise and technical support. However, the inability to systematically document activities conducted by WHO personnel before 2013 overshadowed most of its invaluable contributions due to poor publicity. The inauguration of the Communications Group in December 2013 with a visibility plan necessitated a paradigm shift towards building a culture of documentation to engender visibility.MethodsWe used a pre-post design of activities to evaluate the effectiveness of specific interventions implemented to improve visibility from 2013 to 2016. The paper highlights how incorporating communication strategies into the accountability framework of staff contributed in changing the landscape as well as showcasing the activities of WHO in Nigeria for improved donor relations.ResultsWith the specific interventions implemented to improve WHO's visibility in Nigeria, we found that donor relations improved between 2013 and 2015. It is not a mere coincidence that the period corresponds with the era of incorporation of documentation into the accountability framework of technical staff for visibility as locally mobilized resources increased to record 112% in 2013 and 2014. The intervention assisted in the positive projection of WHO and its donors by the Nigeria media.ConclusionDespite several interventions, which worked, made WHO ubiquitous and added awareness and visibility for donors who funded various projects, other factors could have contributed towards achieving results. Notwithstanding, incorporating documentation component into the accountability framework of field staff and clusters has significantly improved communication of WHO's work and promoted healthy competition for increased visibility.

TI Trends in vitamin D supplement use in a general female and breast cancer
   population in Ireland: A repeated cross-sectional study
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID 25-HYDROXYVITAMIN D LEVELS; CHANGING PATTERNS; WOMEN; RISK; MORTALITY
AB Background
   Vitamin D has been linked with improved survival after breast cancer diagnosis but little is known about prescribing rates. This study investigates trends in vitamin D supplement use in both a general female and breast cancer population.
   Methods
   Women with a breast cancer diagnosis were identified from the National Cancer Registry of Ireland (n = 19870). Women who had any vitamin D claim between 2005 and 2011 were identified from pharmacy claims data (n = 8556). Prevalence rates were calculated as a proportion of all eligible women and by age (<55 years, >= 55 years). Poisson regression was used to compare rates of vitamin D prescribing across years (risk ratio (RR), 95% Cl).
   Results
   There was a statistically significant increase in women with a claim for vitamin D between 2005-2011, with the largest increase among breast cancer patients aged >= 55 years (RR = 2.26; 95% Cl, 2.11-2.42).
   Conclusion
   This may have significant public health implications if associations between vitamin D and improved breast cancer survival prove to be causal.

AB Background
   Primary care practitioners (PCP) play key roles in cervical cancer prevention. Human papillomavirus (HPV) knowledge is an important influence on PCPs' cervical cancer prevention-related behaviours. We investigated HPV knowledge, and associated factors, among general practitioners (GPs) and practice nurses.
   Methods
   A survey, including factual questions about HPV infection and vaccination, was mailed to GPs and practice nurses in Ireland. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine which PCPs had low knowledge (questions correctly answered: infection <= 5/11; vaccination: <= 4/10). Questions least often answered correctly were identified.
   Results
   697 PCPs participated. For HPV infection, GPs and practice nurses answered a median of nine and seven questions correctly, respectively (p<0.001). Significantly associated with low HPV infection knowledge were: being a practice nurse/male GP; working fewer hours/ week; not having public patients; and having never taken a cervical smear. For HPV vaccination, both GPs and practice nurses answered a median of six questions correctly (p = 0.248). Significantly associated with low HPV vaccination knowledge were: being a practice nurse/male GP; working more years in general practice, fewer hours/week, in a smaller practice or in a practice not specialising in women's health; and having never taken a smear. Six HPV infection questions, and seven HPV vaccination questions, were not answered correctly by > of PCPs.
   Conclusions
   There are important limitations in HPV infection and vaccination knowledge among PCPs. By identifying factors associated with poor knowledge, and areas of particular uncertainty, these results can inform development of professional education initiatives thereby ensuring women have access to uniformly high-quality HPV-related information and advice.

AB Introduction
   Shared decision making (SDM) is a process whereby decisions are made together by patients and/or families and clinicians. Nevertheless, few patients are aware of its proven benefits. This study investigated the feasibility, acceptability and impact of an intervention to raise public awareness of SDM in public libraries.
   Materials and methods
   A 1.5 hour interactive workshop to be presented in public libraries was co-designed with Quebec City public library network officials, a science communication specialist and physicians. A clinical topic of maximum reach was chosen: antibiotic overuse in treatment of acute respiratory tract infections. The workshop content was designed and a format, whereby a physician presents the information and the science communication specialist invites questions and participation, was devised. The event was advertised to the general public. An evaluation form was used to collect data on participants' sociodemographics, feasibility and acceptability components and assess a potential impact of the intervention. Facilitators held a post-workshop focus group to qualitatively assess feasibility, acceptability and impact.
   Results
   All 10 planned workshops were held. Out of 106 eligible public participants, 89 were included in the analysis. Most participants were women (77.6%), retired (46.1%) and over 45 (59.5%). Over 90% of participants considered the workshop content to be relevant, accessible, and clear. They reported substantial average knowledge gain about antibiotics (2.4, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 2.0-2.8; P<.001) and about SDM (4.0, 95% CI: 3.44.5; P<.001). Self-reported knowledge gain about SDM was significantly higher than about antibiotics (4.0 versus 2.4; P<.001). Knowledge gain did not vary by sociodemographic characteristics. The focus group confirmed feasibility and suggested improvements.
   Conclusions
   A public library intervention is feasible and effective way to increase public awareness of SDM and could be a new approach to implementing SDM by preparing potential patients to ask for it in the consulting room.

TI Closure of live bird markets leads to the spread of H7N9 influenza in
   China
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID POULTRY MARKET; A(H7N9) VIRUS; HUMAN INFECTION; RISK; EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Following the emergence of H7N9 influenza in March 2013, local animal and public health authorities in China have been closing live bird markets as a measure to try to control the H7N9 influenza epidemic. The role of live bird market (LBM) closure on the spread of N7N9 influenza following the closure of LBMs during March to May 2013 (the first wave) and October 2013 to March 2014 (the second wave) is described in this paper. Different provinces implemented closure actions at different times, and intensive media reports on H7N9 in different provinces started at different times. Local broiler prices dropped dramatically in places with outbreaks and more live chickens were transported to other LBMs in neighboring areas without human cases from infected areas when live bird markets were being closed. There were six clusters of human infection from March to May 2013 and October 2013 to March 2014 and there may have been intensive poultry transportation among cluster areas. These findings provide evidence that the closure of LBMs in early waves of H7N9 influenza had resulted in expansion of H7N9 infection to uninfected areas. This suggests that provincial authorities in inland provinces should be alert to the risks of sudden changes in movement patterns for live birds after LBM closure or increased publicity about LBM closure.

TI Patients who leave Emergency Department without being seen or during

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID PUBLIC HOSPITAL EMERGENCY; PHYSICIAN; NUMBER; CARE; WAIT; PROFILE;
   TRIAGE
AB Background and Aims
   Patients who leave Emergency Department before physician's visit (LWBS) or during treatment (LDT) represent a useful indicator of the emergency care's quality. The profile of patients LWBS was described: they are generally males, young, with lower urgency triage allocation and longer waiting time. They have a greater risk of ED re-admission compared to discharged patients, but effect on hospitalization and mortality are more controversial. The aims of this study are to identify determinants and adverse short term outcomes for LWBS and LDT patients.
   Methods
   This is a retrospective cohort study that include all ED visits of LWBS, LDT and discharged patients in 2015 in the Lazio region, Central Italy. Determinants of LWBS or LDT were selected from gender, age, citizenship, residence area, triage category, chronic comorbidities, number of uncompleted ED visit in the previous year, mode of arrival in ED, time-band, day of the week, waiting time and ED crowding, using a multi-level logistic regression. A multivariate logistic regression was used to test if LWBS or LDT have a greater risk of short term adverse outcome compared to discharged patients.
   Results
   The cohort consists in 835,440 visits in ED, 86.8% subjects visited and discharged, 8.9% subjects are LWBS patients and 4.3% LDT. LWBS and LDT patients are mainly young, males, with a less severe triage, with long waiting times in ED. Moreover, ED crowding and leaving ED before physician's visit in the previous year are risk factors of self-discharging. LWBS and LDT patients have a higher risk of readmission (LWBS: OR = 4.63, 95%CI 4.5-4.7; OR = 2.89, 95%CI 2.8-2.9; LDT: OR = 3.12, 95%CI 3-3.2; OR = 2.25, 95%C12.2-2.3 for readmissions within 2 and 7 days respectively) and hospitalization (LWBS: OR = 3.65, 95%CI 3.4-3.9; OR = 2.25, 95%CI 2.1-2.4; LDT: OR = 3.96, 95%CI 3.6-4.3; OR = 2.62, 95%CI 2.4-2.8 for hospitalization within 2 and 7 days respectively). Furthermore, we find a mortality excess of risk for LWBS patients compared to the reference group (OR = 2.56, 95%CI1.6-4.2; OR = 1.7, 95%CI 1.3-2.2 within 2 and 7 days respectively).
   Conclusions
   Determinants of LWBS confirmed what already known, but LDT patients should be further investigated. There could be adverse health effects for people with LWBS and LDT behaviour. This could be an issue that the Regional Health System should deal with.

   The irrational use of antibiotics is a major driver of antimicrobial resistance. This study aimed to explore how antibiotics were used in secondary and tertiary hospitals in Shaanxi Province, western China from 2013 to 2015.
   Method
   A retrospective study was conducted with a sample of 16 hospitals in Shaanxi Province (2 tertiary and 14 secondary hospitals; 8 public and 8 private hospitals) using a stratified random sampling method. All of the macro data from these hospitals from 2013 to 2015 were analyzed. All collected data were double-entered and analyzed using Excel 2007.
   Results
   The percentage of injectable antibiotic prescriptions was 26.6% of all of the antibiotic prescriptions in the secondary hospitals and 14.2% in the tertiary hospitals. Injectable antibiotic prescriptions in private tertiary hospitals (enter %) were more than two times that of public tertiary hospitals (enter %). In both tertiary and secondary hospitals, the percentage of antibiotic prescriptions for outpatients, emergency patients and inpatients were within the scope of the national standards, while the intensity of antibiotic use was higher than the national standard of 40 DDD/100 bed-days. The prophylactic antibiotic use rate in clean surgery was 40.4% in tertiary hospitals and 60.7% in secondary hospitals, which were both higher than the national standard of 30%. The preventive use rate of antibiotics in private tertiary hospitals (55.00%) was more than two times that of public tertiary hospitals (25.90%), and the rate was also higher in private secondary hospitals (61.50%) than in public secondary hospitals (59.70%).
   Conclusions
   Substantial antibiotic abuse occurred in the sample Chinese hospitals, especially in secondary hospitals. The government should continue to strengthen the administration of antimicrobial use in hospitals. At the same time, medical professional training and interventions for physicians should be conducted to fundamentally reduce the irrational use of antibiotics.

AB BackgroundCervical cancer which is preventable by screening and vaccination is the most common cancer in Zambia among both the female and male population. In this article we aim to determine how the key players of the sociocultural and political environment recognize cervical cancer as a public health problem and therefore impact the provision of cervical cancer prevention services (screening and vaccination).MethodsQualitative data in the form of interviews with stakeholders (health care providers, teachers and religious leaders), special interest groups (advocacy groups and non-governmental organizations) and policy makers, was collected as part of a mixed methods study from February to May 2016.ResultsThe views expressed by the respondents were coded into predetermined themes (cervical cancer in general, screening, vaccination) and an organizational chart of the administration of cervical cancer prevention services in Zambia was developed.ConclusionsIt is evident that the Zambian cervical cancer prevention system has targeted several areas and multiple sectors of society to reduce cervical cancer cases. However, awareness, knowledge, social support and facilities are factors that can be improved.

AB BackgroundIn publicly funded health care systems, governance models are developed to push public service providers to use tax payers' money more efficiently and maintain a high quality of service. Although this implies change in staff behaviors, evaluation studies commonly focus on organizational outputs. Unintended consequences for staff have been observed in case studies, but theoretical and methodological development is necessary to enable studies of staff experience in larger populations across various settings. The aim of the study is to develop a self-assessment scale of staff experience of the governance of economic efficiency and quality of health care and to assess its psychometric properties.MethodsFactors relevant to staff members' experience of economic efficiency and quality requirements of health care were identified in the literature and through interviews with practitioners, and then compared to a theoretical model of behavior change. Relevant experiences were developed into sub-factors and items. The scale was tested in collaboration with the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at a university hospital. 93 staff members participated. The scale's psychometric properties were assessed using exploratory factor analysis, analysis of internal consistency and criterion-related validity.ResultsThe analysis revealed an eight factor structure (including sub-factors knowledge and awareness, opportunity to influence, motivation, impact on professional autonomy and organizational alignment), and items showed strong factor loadings and high internal consistency within sub-factors. Sub-factors were interrelated and contributed to the prediction of impact on clinical behavior (criterion).ConclusionsThe scale clearly distinguishes between various experiences regarding economic efficiency and quality requirements among health care staff, and shows satisfactory psychometric quality. The scale has broad applications for research and practice, as it serves as a tool for capturing staff members' perspectives when evaluating and improving health care governance. The scale could also be useful for understanding the underlying processes of changes in provider performance and for adapting management strategies to engage staff in driving change that contributes to increased economic efficiency and quality, for the benefit of health care systems, patients and staff.

AB BackgroundSystems science methods such as dynamic simulation modelling are well suited to address questions about public health policy as they consider the complexity, context and dynamic nature of system-wide behaviours. Advances in technology have led to increased accessibility and interest in systems methods to address complex health policy issues. However, the involvement of policy decision makers in health-related simulation model development has been lacking. Where end-users have been included, there has been limited examination of their experience of the participatory modelling process and their views about the utility of the findings. This paper reports the experience of end-user decision makers, including senior public health policy makers and health service providers, who participated in three participatory simulation modelling for health policy case studies (alcohol related harm, childhood obesity prevention, diabetes in pregnancy), and their perceptions of the value and efficacy of this method in an applied health sector context.MethodsSemi-structured interviews were conducted with end-user participants from three participatory simulation modelling case studies in Australian real-world policy settings. Interviewees were employees of government agencies with jurisdiction over policy and program decisions and were purposively selected to include perspectives at different stages of model development.ResultsThe co-production' aspect of the participatory approach was highly valued. It was reported as an essential component of building understanding of the modelling process, and thus trust in the model and its outputs as a decision-support tool. The unique benefits of simulation modelling included its capacity to explore interactions of risk factors and combined interventions, and the impact of scaling up interventions. Participants also valued simulating new interventions prior to implementation in the real world, and the comprehensive mapping of evidence and its gaps to prioritise future research. The participatory aspect of simulation modelling was time and resource intensive and therefore most suited to high priority complex topics with contested options for intervening.ConclusionThese findings highlight the value of a participatory approach to dynamic simulation modelling to support its utility in applied health policy settings.

AB BackgroundThe entertainment precincts of cities, while contributing to local economies, need to be carefully managed to mitigate harms. Individual behaviours and government regulation have typically been the foci of interventions aimed at reducing alcohol-related harm. Little is known about how changes to the built environment might influence alcohol-related harms in these settings. The aim of this study was to explore how a public shelter and a volunteer-funded and staffed mobile van in a regional city influenced perceptions of safety and reduction in alcohol-related harm.MethodsAn intrinsic case-study approach was used. Document reviews, qualitative interviews with 16 key informants (volunteers, licensees, police, local business owners, patrons, community members and security guards), observation, and secondary data analysis were conducted in 2016. A conceptual framework of the causative pathways linking the drivers of alcohol consumption with social and health outcomes was used to inform the analysis.ResultsThe shelter and van were frequently utilised but there was no significant association with a reduction in the proportion of alcohol-related hospital emergency department presentations or police incident reports. Occupational health and safety risks were identified for the volunteers which had no management plan.ConclusionsThe findings highlight the challenge faced by local governments/authorities wanting to provide community-based interventions to complement other evidence-based approaches to reduce alcohol-related harm. Local governments/authorities with restricted regulatory oversight need to collaborate with key agencies for targeted upstream and evidence-based alcohol prevention and management interventions before investing resources. Such approaches are critical for improving community safety as well as health and social outcomes in communities at greatest risk of alcohol-related harm.

AB BackgroundBrucellosis remains one of the most common zoonotic diseases globally, with more than half million human cases reported annually. Brucellosis is an emerging and re-emerging disease in China since the 1990s. An infectious reservoir constituted by domestic animals with brucellosis, especially ovine and caprine herds, poses a significant threat to public health. The seroprevalence of brucellosis in sheep and goat flocks in a national context is unavailable so far. Therefore, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the overall status of brucellosis in sheep and goats in China in almost two decades.ResultsThe pooled prevalence of brucellosis in ovine and caprine flocks in China increased in 2000-2009 (1.00%; 95% CI, 0.70-1.30) to 2010-2018 (3.20%; 95% CI, 2.70-3.60). The seroprevalence of brucellosis in sheep and goat flocks was higher in Eastern China, with 7.00% of positive rate, than that in any other region, especially Shandong province (18.70%). Brucellosis is highly endemic in some local regions. The high prevalence of brucellosis in agricultural regions is suggestive of a shift of geographic distribution. The pooled prevalence of brucellosis is higher in goat flocks than in sheep flocks in China.ConclusionsThe overall data in this meta-analysis demands comprehensive intervention measures and further surveillance to facilitate the control of brucellosis in livestock. Further studies aimed at evaluating the risk factors associated with spreads of brucellosis in domestic animals unaddressed so far, and sufficient epidemiological data is important to the exploration and understanding of the prevalent status of brucellosis throughout the country and to disease control.

AB BackgroundCompetency frameworks that prompt personal and professional development have become an important component of lifelong learning; they are driven by healthcare professionals' need for development and professional recognition. This study aimed to evaluate the self-assessed competencies of community pharmacist-preceptors by using Croatian Competency Framework (CCF) and to identify competencies to be improved. The secondary aim was to explore the association between community pharmacists' characteristics (i.e. age, education etc.) and self-assessed competency performance.MethodsThe study subjects were community pharmacist-preceptors who provide support to and mentor student trainees enrolled in pre-registration training for pharmacy students. At the beginning of their mentorship, the pharmacist-preceptors assessed their competencies on a four-point Likert scale by using the Croatian Competency Framework (CCF), a validated tool for assessment and self-assessment of community and hospital pharmacists. Data were collected via e-mail in the period from October 2015 to April 2016.ResultsOf the 260 community pharmacists approached, final analysis included 223 respondents. The response rate was 85.8%. Community pharmacist-preceptors assessed themselves as the most competent in competencies pertaining to the cluster Organization and management competencies (M=3.64, SD=0.34), while they considered themselves as the least competent in the competencies pertaining to the cluster Pharmaceutical public health competencies (M=2.75, SD=0.77). Younger pharmacists with a postgraduate qualification who worked for large pharmacy chains in the capital city area and who had been in their current posts for a shorter period perceived themselves to be more competent.ConclusionThis research represents the first analysis of the CCF in practice and identifies community pharmacist-preceptor competencies that require improvement. Consequently, areas for additional professional education were defined. Implementing modalities to measure and support development of preceptors' competences is essential for improvement of student training programmes.

AB BackgroundSmoking is a cause of avoidable morbidity and mortality. In the United Kingdom (UK) the national smoking ban inside hospital buildings is widely adhered to. There is a perception it has led to smokers congregating around hospital entrances (Selbie D. 2016, It's time for a truly smokefree NHS. Public Health Matters Blog. Public Health England). Efforts to shift social norms and create positive smokefree environments might be strengthened by delivering social norms messages. This study explored the impact of a social norms approach campaign to reduce levels of misperceptions surrounding support for smokefree hospital entrances.MethodRepeated cross sectional study design. Staff, patients, and hospital visitors at Pinderfields National Health Service (NHS) Hospital (Wakefield, United Kingdom (UK)) completed a survey before and after implementation of a public health social norms campaign (n=481 surveyed before; n=459 surveyed after). The main outcome measure was difference between perceived and reported levels of support for smokefree hospital entrances.ResultsThere were high levels of support for smokefree hospital entrances. The majority of participants agreed that patients (n=849, 90% agreed), staff (n=863, 92% agreed), and visitors (n=850, 90% agreed) should not smoke in the hospital entrance.Participants underestimated the proportion of others who self-reported keeping the entrance smokefree. Over 90% of respondents reported not smoking in the hospital entrance, but the perception was that between 50 to 75% of hospital staff, patients, and visitors did not smoke in the hospital entrance.The mean percentage of hospital staff, patients, and visitors who respondents thought did not smoke in entrances was higher for respondents responding after, compared to those responding before, the campaign. There was an overall significant effect of time on attitudes towards smoking in the entrances; in all instances the mean percentage of hospital staff, patients, and visitors the participants believed agreed that hospital entrances should be smokefree was higher for those responding after, compared with before, the campaign.ConclusionsPeople hold misperceptions of the proportion of people who choose to smoke in the hospital entrance. The social norms approach campaign was associated with a strengthening of positive social norms. Such campaigns should be considered by Trusts as one evidence-based based tactic to denormalise smoking, increase support for smokefree policies.

AB BackgroundLassa fever has been a public health concern in the West African sub-region where it is endemic and a latent threat to the world at large. We investigated the trend in Lassa fever research using bibliometric approach.MethodsWe used the SCOPUS database employing Lassa fever as search descriptor. The most common bibliometric indicators were applied for the selected publications.ResultsThe number of scientific research articles retrieved for Lassa fever research from 1970 to 2017 was 1101. The growth of publications was more linear (r=0.67) than exponential (r=0.53). The duplication time of the scientific articles was 9.19years. Small number of authors were responsible for bulk of the article production (transience index of 78.89%). The collaboration index was 4.59 per paper. The Bradford core consisted of 19 journals in which Journal of Virology was at the top (4.6%). Majority of the output were from USA government agencies. United States was the most productive country. Joseph B. McCormick was the most productive author, while New England Journal of Medicine published the two most cited articles.ConclusionThe growth of scientific Literature on Lassa fever was of linear pattern with high transient authors indicating low productivity and non-specialized authors from other related areas publishing sporadically. This study provides a helpful reference for medical virologists, epidemiologist, policy decision makers, academics and Lassa fever researchers.

TI An audit of antimicrobial prescribing by dental practitioners in the
   north east of England and Cumbria
SO BMC ORAL HEALTH
LA English

DE Antibiotics; Audit; Dental; Prescribing
ID DENTISTS; CARE
AB BackgroundInappropriate prescribing of antimicrobials is a significant threat to global public health. In England, approximately 5% of all antimicrobial items are prescribed by dentists, despite the limited indications for their use in the treatment of oral infections in published clinical guidelines. The objective of this study was to survey antimicrobial prescribing by dental practitioners in North East England and Cumbria, identify educational and training needs and develop a self-assessment tool that can be used for Continued Professional Development by individual practitioners.MethodsDuring October 2016, 275 dental practitioners used a standardised form to record anonymous information about patients who had been prescribed antimicrobials. Clinical information and prescribing details were compared against clinical guidelines published by the Faculty of General Dental Practitioners UK.ResultsDental practitioners provided data on 1893 antimicrobial prescriptions. There was documented evidence of systemic spread, such as pyrexia in 18% of patients. Dentists recorded patients' pain (91.1% of patients), local lymph gland involvement (41.5%) gross diffuse swelling (55.5%) dysphagia (7.2%) and trismus (13.6%). Reasons for prescribing antimicrobials included patient expectations (25.8%), patient preference (24.8%), time pressures (10.9%), and patients uncooperative with other treatments (10.4%). The most commonly prescribed antimicrobials were amoxicillin, accounting for 61.2% of prescriptions, followed by metronidazole (29.9%). Most prescriptions for amoxicillin were for either 5days (66.8%) or 7days (29.6%) and most prescriptions for metronidazole were for a 5-day course (65.2%) or 7-day (18.6%) course.ConclusionIn most cases, when an antimicrobial was prescribed, practitioners used the correct choice of agents and usually prescribed these at the correct dose. However, some evidence of suboptimal prescribing practices when compared to the Faculty of General Dental Practitioner guidelines were identified. The audit has identified training needs across the region and aided the development of Continued Professional Development sessions. Further work to identify barriers and facilitators for improving antimicrobial prescribing and determining appropriate methods to improve clinical practice are required.

ID ADOLESCENTS PERCEPTIONS; TOBACCO; MARIJUANA; DEPRESSION; ASSOCIATION;
   BENEFITS
AB BackgroundThere is strong evidence that plain cigarette packaging and health warning labels (HWLs) reduce brand appeal and increase health knowledge. There is limited evidence examining this population-level public health approach for cannabis packaging. This issue is of particular importance in light of the recent legalization of recreational cannabis in Canada. The current study examined perceptions of plain packaging and HWLs for cannabis packages among young adults.MethodsAn online experimental study was conducted with a sample of university students in Alberta, Canada (n=656). Respondents were randomly assigned to view cannabis packages in one of four conditions: Condition 1: branded pack, Condition 2: plain pack (uniform color, brand imagery removed, standardized font), Condition 3: branded pack with a HWL, and Condition 4: plain pack with a HWL. Respondents in Conditions 3 and 4 viewed five text-based HWLs, each corresponding to a health effect associated with cannabis use: (1) brain development, (2) mental health issues, (3) impaired driving, (4) nonlethal overdose, and (5) addiction. After viewing packs, respondents rated packs and health warnings on various measures.ResultsBranded packages without HWLs were rated as most appealing compared to all other packs (p<0.001 for all contrasts). No differences were found in ratings of appeal when comparing branded and plain packs with HWLs. Warning messages for cognitive development and impaired driving were rated highest on levels of perceived effectiveness, believability, and fear, whereas the addiction warning was rated among the lowest. In general, there were gaps in health knowledge related to cannabis use, however after viewing packs with warnings (compared to viewing packs without warnings) levels of health knowledge increased across all health effects (p<0.01 for all). Lastly, a significant majority of young adults reported they would purchase the branded pack without a HWL (39.5%), compared to all other pack types (p<0.05 for all contrasts). The lowest proportion of young adults reported they would purchase a plain pack with a HWL (1.1%).ConclusionsPlain packaging and health warnings may reduce brand appeal and increase health knowledge among young adults.

TI Practice and lived experience of menstrual exiles (Chhaupadi) among
   adolescent girls in far-western Nepal
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH
AB Background
   Menstrual exile, also known as Chhaupadi, is a tradition of "untouchability" in far-western Nepal. Forbidden from touching other people and objects, women and girls are required to live away from the community, typically in a livestock shed, during menstruation. We assessed the lived experiences of Chhaupadi among Nepalese adolescent girls in the far-western Achham district of Nepal, observed the safety and sanitation of their living spaces during Chhaupadi, and assessed the perceptions of local adult stakeholders towards the practice of Chhaupadi.
   Methods
   We collected data from 107 adolescent girls using a self-administered survey in two local schools in Achham. We also conducted a focus group discussion with seven girls, held key informant interviews, and observed the girls' living spaces during Chhaupadi, using a checklist. Descriptive statistics of the quantitative survey and thematic analyses of qualitative interviews are presented.
   Results
   The majority of the girls (n = 77, 72%) practiced exile, or Chhaupadi, during their menstruation, including 3 (4%) exiled to traditional Chhau sheds, 63 (82%) to livestock sheds, and 11 (14%) to courtyards outside their home. The remaining girls (n = 30, 28%) stayed inside the house, yet practiced some form of menstrual taboos. Of the 77 observed living spaces where the girls stayed during exile, only 30% (n = 23) had a toilet facility. Most exiled girls (97.4%) were restricted from eating dairy products. Participants reported having various psychological problems, including lonliness and difficulty sleeping while practicing Chhaupadi. Three of the girls were physically abused; nine were bitten by a snake. Notably high proportions of the living spaces lacked ventilation/windows (n = 20, 26%), electricity (n = 29, 38%), toilets (n = 54, 70%) and a warm blanket and mattress for sleeping (n = 29, 38%). Our qualitative findings supported our quantitative results.
   Conclusions
   Chhaupadi has been condemned by human rights organizations. While the government has banned the practice, implementation on the ban is proceeding slowly, especially in far-western Nepal. Thus, as a temporary measure, public health professionals must work towards promoting the health and safety of Nepalese women and girls still practicing Chhaupadi.

TI Sub-national health accounts: Experience from Punjab State in India
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PUBLIC-SECTOR; CARE; COST
AB Introduction
   Public health spending in India has been traditionally one of the lowest globally. Punjab is one of the states with highest proportion of out-of-pocket expenditures for healthcare in India. We undertook this study to produce the sub-national health accounts (SNHA) for Punjab state in India.
   Methodology
   We used System of Health Accounts (SHA) 2011 framework for preparing health accounts for Punjab state. Data on health spending by government was obtained from concerned public sector departments both at state and central level. Estimates on Out-of-Pocket Expenditures (DOPE) expenditure were derived from National Sample Survey (NSS) 71st round data, Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) data and Pharmatrac. Primary surveys were done for assessing health expenditure data by firms and non-governmental organizations. All estimates of healthcare expenditures reported in our paper pertain to 2013-14, and are reported in both Indian National Rupee (INR) and United States Dollar (US $),using average conversion rate of INR 60.50 per US $.
   Results
   In 2013-14, the current health expenditures (CE) in Punjab was INR 134,680million (US $ 2245 million) which was 4.02% of its gross state domestic product (GSDP).However, public spending on health was 0.95% of GSDP i.e. 21% of the total health expenditure (THE), while 79% was private expenditure. In per capita terms, THE in Punjab was INR 4963 (US $ 82.03). In terms of functions, medical goods (41.6%) and curative care (37%) consumed larger share of expenditure in the Punjab state. Households spent 52% of expenditures for medicines and other pharmaceutical goods. Risk pooling mechanisms are being adopted to a lesser extent in the state.
   Conclusion
   The healthcare in Punjab is largely financed through private DOPE. Currently, public health spending in Punjab is inadequate to meet the healthcare demands of population, which is less than 1% of state's GSDP. Monitoring public resources is very important for better resource allocations. Health Accounts production is useful in order to assess future trends and impact of health financing policies on goals of universal health coverage and should be made a part of routine monitoring system both at national and sub-national level.

TI Use of otoacoustic emissions to improve outcomes and reduce disparities
   in a community preschool hearing screening program
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; CHILDREN; PREVALENCE; INTERVENTION; ACCURACY; HEALTH; AGE
AB Introduction
   Hearing loss substantially impacts pediatric development, and early identification improves outcomes. While intervening before school-entry is critical to optimize learning, early-childhood hearing screening practices are highly variable. Conditioned play audiometry (CPA) is the gold standard for preschool hearing screening, but otoacoustic emission (OAE) testing provides objective data that may improve screening outcomes.
   Objectives
   To compare outcomes of a community-based low-income preschool hearing program before and after implementation of OAE in a single-visit, two-tiered paradigm. We hypothesized that this intervention would reduce referral rates and improve follow-up while maintaining stable rates of diagnosed sensorineural hearing loss.
   Methods
   We performed a cohort study of 3257 children screened from July 2014-June 2016. Department of Public Health data were analyzed pre- and post-implementation of second-line OAE testing for children referred on CPA screening with targeted follow-up by DPH staff.
   Primary outcomes included referral rates, follow-up rates, and diagnosis of sensorineural hearing loss.
   Results
   Demographics, pure-tone pass rates, and incidence of newly-diagnosed permanent hearing loss were similar across years. After intervention, overall pass rates increased from 92% to 95% (P = 0.0014), while only 0.7% remained unable to be tested (P<0.0001). 5% of children were unable to be tested by CPA screening but passed OAE testing, obviating further evaluation. Referral rate decreased from 8% to 5% (P = 0.0014), and follow-up improved from 36% to 91% (P<0.0001). Identification of pathology in children with follow-up increased from 19% to over 50%. Further, disparities in pass rates and ability to test seen in Year 1 were eliminated in Year 2.
   Conclusion and relevance
   In a community setting, implementation of second-line OAE screening for CPA referrals reduced referral rates, increased identification of hearing loss, reduced outcome disparities, and improved follow-up rates. This study provides lessons in how to improve outcomes and reduce disparities in early-childhood hearing screening.

AB Many studies have demonstrated the existence of simple, unidimensional socioeconomic gradients in body mass index (BMI). However, in the present paper we move beyond such traditional analyses by simultaneously considering multiple demographic and socioeconomic dimensions. Using the Spanish National Health Survey 2011-2012, we apply intersectionality theory and multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy (MAIHDA) to analyze 14,190 adults nested within 108 intersectional strata defined by combining categories of gender, age, income, educational achievement and living situation. We develop two multilevel models to obtain information on stratum-specific BMI averages and the degree of clustering of BMI within strata expressed by the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). The first model is a simple variance components analysis that provides a detailed mapping of the BMI disparities in the population and measures the accuracy of stratum membership to predict individual BMI. The second model includes the variables used to define the intersectional strata as a way to identify stratum-specific interactions. The first model suggests moderate but meaningful clustering of individual BMI within the intersectional strata (ICC = 12.4%). Compared with the population average (BMI = 26.07 Kg/m2), the stratum of cohabiting 18-35-year-old females with medium income and high education presents the lowest BMI (-3.7 Kg/m2), while cohabiting 36-64-year-old females with low income and low education show the highest BMI (+2.6 Kg/m2). In the second model, the ICC falls to 1.9%, suggesting the existence of only very small stratum specific interaction effects. We confirm the existence of a socioeconomic gradient in BMI. Compared with traditional analyses, the intersectional MAIHDA approach provides a better mapping of socioeconomic and demographic inequalities in BMI. Because of the moderate clustering, public health policies aiming to reduce BMI in Spain should not solely focus on the intersectional strata with the highest BMI, but should also consider whole population polices.

AB Many national (US) and International guidelines for physical activity provide guidance that under-active and sedentary adults can begin by accumulating moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in bouts as brief as 10 minutes. This guidance fits well with Goal Setting theory in that goals should be realistic and achievable, and is also consistent with Social Cognitive theory since achieving small goals should boost self-efficacy and thus, encourage continued physical activity. In contrast, Behavioral Economics might suggest that fewer, longer bouts would be more conducive to the adoption of physical activity due to the costs incurred with each separate bout of MVPA. This paper examines patterns of MVPA adoption among a sample of under-active adults from the perspective of goal setting theory and behavioral economics to explore specific strategies to help people who are in the early stages of PA activity adoption. Under-active men and women (N = 225; mean age = 46 +/- 10; mean BMI = 28 +/- 4.48) who enrolled in a PA intervention participated in a single goal setting session at enrollment. Participants were encouraged to set realistic goals and to increase their activity to meet national recommendations (150 minutes/week of moderate to vigorous physical activity [MVPA]) by the 6-month follow up. This process included identifying a specific frequency goal (days/week) and session duration goal (minutes/day). At baseline, participants reported average weekly MVPA of 14.59 min (+/- 24), which increased to an average of 140.52 (+/- 143.55) at 6 months. MVPA goals at baseline averaged 33.24 min/day (+/- 18.08) and 3.85 days/week (+/- 1.31). Analyses showed that longer session duration goals set at baseline were associated with more weekly minutes of MVPA at 6 months (b = 1.26, SE = 0.58, t = 2.17, p = 0.03). There was no significant association between goals for number of days per week (frequency) or total minutes of weekly MVPA (minutes x frequency) and MVPA at 6 months. Widely promoted guidelines for uptake of physical activity recommend accumulating physical activity in bouts as short as 10 minutes. This recommendation may ultimately hinder the adoption of physical activity among under-active and sedentary individuals. For the purposes of behavioral adoption of MVPA, more ambitious session duration goals appear to result in higher levels of physical activity participation.

AB Background and aim
   Smoking is still a public health concern in many countries, especially among young adults. Consequently, we determined what factors affect university students' smoking behavior in Turkey.
   Methods
   This cross-sectional study was conducted between March and June 2017 using a simple random sampling method. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect information on participants' (N = 2,505; mean age = 20.9 +/- 2.5 years; 58.9% women) sociodemographic characteristics, cigarette smoking status, and related risk factors. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed with the Backward likelihood-ratio method.
   Results
   Students were completing either two- or four-year degrees (45.6% and 54.4%, respectively). Regarding familial smoking behavior, 36.1% had a father who smoked, 10.3% had a mother who smoked, and 15.0% had siblings who smoked. Among participants, 27.9% were current smokers: 46% of the men and 15.3% of the women. Mean smoking onset age was 16.34 +/- 2.72 years (15.65 +/- 2.67 years for men and 16.34 +/- 2.72 for women (p < .05). Mean Fager-stromtest score was 4.43 +/- 1.82, and women had lower test scores than did men (p < .05). After controlling for potential confounders in multivariate analyses, five factors were significantly positively associated with current smoking: being a man (odds ratio (OR): 3.43; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.75-4.28), studying in a two-year program (OR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.39-2.18), having at least one immediate family member who smoked (OR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.31-2.04), having all close friends who smoked (OR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.40-2.33), and alcohol consumption (OR: 4.39; 95% CI: 3.51-5.49).
   Conclusion
   There was a higher smoking rate among our study population, both compared to similar national studies and Turkey's overall smoking rate. Underlying factors should be evaluated via qualitative studies and preventive strategies should be implemented accordingly.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the spatial variability of asthma outcomes in Ontario, Canada and broad environmental factors that contribute to this variability. Age-/sex-standardized asthma prevalence and health services use rates (2003-2013) were obtained from a provincial cohort of asthma patients. Employing an ecological-level study design, descriptive and Bayesian spatial regression analyses were used to examine patterns of asthma outcomes and their relationship to physical environment, socioeconomic environment and healthcare factors. Significant spatial variation in asthma outcomes was found between southern urban/suburban areas and northern/rural areas. Rurality was found to have a substantial effect on all asthma outcomes, except hospitalizations. For example, the most rural areas were associated with lower asthma prevalence and physician visits [RR = 0.708, 95% credible interval (CI): 0.636-0.795 and RR = 0.630, 95% CI: 0.504-0.758, respectively], and with higher ED visits (RR = 1.818, 95% CI: 1.194-2.858), when compared to urban areas. Strong associations were also found between material deprivation and ED visits (RR = 1.559, 95% CI: 1.358-1.737) and hospitalizations (RR = 1.259, 95% CI: 1.143-1.374). Associations between asthma outcomes and environmental variables such as air pollution and temperature were also found. Findings can be expected to inform the development of improved public health strategies, which take into account local environmental, socioeconomic and healthcare characteristics.

AB BackgroundVisual impairment is a global public health problem, with an estimated 285 million affected globally, of which 43% are due to refractive error. A lack of specialist eye care in low and middle-income countries indicates a new model of care would support a task-shifting model and address this urgent need. We describe the features and results of the process evaluation of a national primary eye care (PEC) programme in Rwanda.MethodsWe used the Medical Research Council process evaluation framework to examine the implementation of the PEC programme, and to determine enablers and challenges to implementation. The process evaluation uses a mixed methods approach, drawing on results from several sources including a survey of 574 attendees at 50 PEC clinics, structured clinical observations of 30 PEC nurses, in-depth interviews with 19 key stakeholders, documentary review and a participatory process evaluation workshop with key stakeholders to review collated evidence and contextualize the results.ResultsStructured clinical assessment indicated that the PEC provided is consistent with the PEC curriculum, with over 90% of the clinical examination processes conducted correctly. In 4 years, programme monitoring data showed that nearly a million PEC eye examinations had been conducted in every health centre in Rwanda, with 2707 nurses trained. The development of the eye health system was an important enabler in the implementation of PEC, where political support allowed key developments such as inclusion of eye-drops on the essential medicines list, the inclusion of PEC on insurance benefits, the integration of PEC indicators on the health management information systems and integration of the PEC curriculum into the general nursing school curriculum. Challenges included high turnover of primary care nurses, lack of clarity and communication on the future funding of the programme, competing priorities for the health sector and sustained supervision to assure quality of care.ConclusionsA model of a national primary eye care programme is presented, with service delivery to all areas in Rwanda. Key learning from this evaluation is the importance of strengthening the eye health care system, together with a strong focus on training primary care nurses using a PEC curriculum.

AB BackgroudPrimate erythroparvovirus 1 (B19V) is a globally ubiquitous DNA virus. Infection results in a variety of clinical presentations including erythema infectiosum in children and arthralgia in adults. There is limited understanding of the seroprevalence of B19V antibodies in the Australian population and therefore of population-wide immunity. This study aimed to investigate the seroprevalence of B19V antibodies in an Australian blood donor cohort, along with a cohort from a paediatric population.MethodsAge/sex/geographical location stratified plasma samples (n=2221) were collected from Australian blood donors. Samples were also sourced from paediatric patients (n=223) in Queensland. All samples were screened for B19V IgG using an indirect- enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.ResultsOverall, 57.90% (95% CI: 55.94%-59.85%) of samples tested positive for B19V IgG, with the national age-standardized seroprevalence of B19V exposure in Australians aged 0 to 79years estimated to be 54.41%. Increasing age (p<0.001) and state of residence (p<0.001) were independently associated with B19V exposure in blood donors, with the highest rates in donors from Tasmania (71.88%, 95% CI: 66.95%-76.80%) and donors aged 65-80years (78.41%, 95% CI: 74.11%-82.71%). A seroprevalence of 52.04% (95% CI: 47.92%-56.15%) was reported in women of child-bearing age (16 to 44years). Sex was not associated with exposure in blood donors (p=0.547) or in children (p=0.261) screened in this study.ConclusionsThis study highlights a clear association between B19Vexposure and increasing age, with over half of the Australian population likely to be immune to this virus. Differences in seroprevalence were also observed in donors residing in different states, with a higher prevalence reported in those from the southern states. The finding is consistent with previous studies, with higher rates observed in countries with a higher latitude. This study provides much needed insight into the prevalence of B19Vexposure in the Australian population, which has implications for public health as well as transfusion and transplantation safety in Australia.

AB BackgroundLeishmaniasis is a neglected and poorly reported parasitic infection transmitted by sand flies in tropical and subtropical regions. Knowledge about leishmaniasis has become important in non-endemic countries due to increased migration and travel. Few studies of the clinical management of cutaneous, mucocutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in non-endemic regions have been published to date. In this study, we aimed to evaluate patient characteristics, clinical manifestations and treatments of leishmaniasis in Sweden, over a 20-year period.MethodsA retrospective observational nationwide study was performed using medical records of patients diagnosed with leishmaniasis in Sweden from 1996 to 2016. Cases with culture and polymerase chain reaction verified leishmaniasis were identified at the Public Health Agency of Sweden.ResultsIn total, 165 cases of leishmaniasis were diagnosed from 1996 to 2016. Medical records from 156 patients (95%) were available for review and included in the study. Cutaneous leishmaniasis was the dominant manifestation (n=149, 96%), and in 66 patients (44%) cutaneous leishmaniasis was due to Leishmania tropica. Other manifestations were mucocutaneous (n=4, 3%), visceral (n=2, 1%) and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (n=1, 1%). During this time period, the number of cases increased, especially after 2013. Most patients (n=81, 52%) were migrants who were infected in their countries of origin (from 2013 to 2016, mainly Syria or Afghanistan). Other groups were Swedish tourists (25%) and returning workers (13%). The time from collection of the diagnostic sample to the start of treatment was less than one month in 81 (66%) patients and under three months in 124 patients (96%). Among the 149 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis, 125 patients received antileishmanial treatment, and in 88 of these patients (70%) cure was achieved, regardless of treatment.ConclusionsThe number of leishmaniasis cases diagnosed in Sweden increased between 1996 and 2016, mainly in migrants from endemic countries. Although leishmaniasis is a rare disease in Sweden, patients appear to be diagnosed early and treated according to current European guidelines, resulting in an overall high cure rate.

AB BackgroundMalaria prevalence in Cameroon is a major public health problem both at the regional and urban-rural geographic scale. In 2016, an estimated 1.6 million confirmed cases, and 18,738 cases were reported in health facilities and communities respectively, with about 8000 estimated deaths. Several studies have estimated malaria prevalence in Cameroon using the analytical techniques at the regional scale. We aimed at identifying malaria clusters and hotspots at the urban-rural geographic scale from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data for households between 2000 and 2015 using ArcGIS for intervention programs.MethodsTo identify malaria hotspots and analyze the pattern of distribution, we used the optimized hotspots toolset and spatial autocorrelation respectively in ArcGIS 10.3 for desktop. We also used Pearson's Correlation analysis to identify associative environmental factors using the R-software 3.4.1.ResultsThe spatial distribution of malaria showed statistically significant clustered pattern for the year 2000 and 2015 with Moran's indexes 0.126 (P<0.001) and 0.187 (P<0.001) respectively. Meanwhile, the years 2005 and 2010 with Moran's indexes 0.001 (P=0.488) and 0.002 (P=0.318) respectively, had a random malaria distribution pattern. There exist varying degrees of malaria clusters and statistically significant hotspots in the urban-rural areas of the 12 administrative regions. Malaria cases were associated with population density and some environmental covariates; rainfall, enhanced vegetation index and composite lights (P<0.001).ConclusionThis study identified urban-rural areas with high and low malaria clusters and hotspots. Our maps can be used as supportive tools for effective malaria control and elimination, and investments in malaria programs and research, malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment, surveillance, should pay more attention to urban-rural geographic scale.

AB BackgroundGreenland struggles with a high prevalence of smoking, alcohol and drug abuse. In response to the increasing need for preventive initiatives, the first public health program Inuuneritta was introduced in 2007. Internationally, frameworks focus primarily on the implementation of a single, well-described intervention or program. However, with the increasing need and emergence of more holistic, integrated approaches, a need for research investigating the process of policy implementation from launch to action arises. This paper aims to augment the empirical evidence on the implementation of integrated health promotion programs within a governmental setting using the case of Inuuneritta II. In this study, the constraining and enabling determinants of the implementation processes within and across levels and sectors were examined.MethodsQualitative methods with a transdisciplinary approach were applied. Data collection consisted of six phases with different qualitative methods applied to gain a comprehensive overview and understanding of Inuuneritta II's implementation process. These methods included: observations and focus group discussions at the community health worker (CHW) conference, telephone interviews, document analysis, and a workshop on results dissemination.ResultsEnabling determinants influencing the implementation process of Inuuneritta II positively were high motivation among adopters, local prevention committees supporting community health workers, and the initiation of the central prevention committee. In contrast, constraining determinants were ambiguous program aims, high turnovers, siloed budgets and work environments, and an inconsistent and neglected central prevention committee.ConclusionInuuneritta II provided a substantial framework for an integrated health policy approach. However, having a holistic and comprehensive program enabling an integrated approach is not sufficient. Inuuneritta II's integrated approach does not harmonise with the government's inflexible organisational structure resulting in insufficient implementation.

AB Objectives
   The aim was to gain knowledge regarding the risk of perinatal death related to exposure to dental amalgam fillings in the mother.
   Design
   Population-based observational cohort study.
   Setting
   The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, a Norwegian birth cohort of children born in 1999-2008 conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.
   Participants
   72,038 pregnant women with data on the number of teeth filled with dental amalgam.
   Main outcome measures
   Data on perinatal death (stillbirth >= 22 weeks plus early neonatal death 0-7 days after birth) were obtained from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway.
   Results
   The absolute risk of perinatal death ranged from 0.20% in women with no amalgam-filled teeth to 0.67% in women with 13 or more teeth filled with amalgam. Analyses including the number of teeth filled with amalgam as a continuous variable indicated an increased risk of perinatal death by increasing number of teeth filled with dental amalgam (crude OR 1.065, 95% CI 1.034 to 1.098, p<0.001). After adjustment for potential confounders (mothers' age, education, body mass index, parity, smoking during pregnancy, alcohol consumption during pregnancy) included as categorical variables, there was still an increased risk for perinatal death associated with increasing number of teeth filled with amalgam (ORadj 1.041, 95% CI 1.008 to 1.076, p = 0.015). By an increased exposure from 0 to 16 teeth filled with amalgam, the model predicted an almost doubled odds ratio (ORadj 1.915, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.28). In groups with 1 to 12 teeth filled with amalgam the adjusted odds ratios were slightly, but not significantly, increased. The group with the highest exposure (participants with 13 or more teeth filled with amalgam) had an adjusted OR of 2.34 (95% CI 1.27 to 4.32; p = 0.007).
   Conclusion
   The current findings suggest that the risk of perinatal death could increase in a dose-dependent way based on the mother's number of teeth filled with dental amalgam. However, we cannot exclude that the relatively modest odds ratios could be a result of residual confounding. Additional studies on the relationship between exposure to dental amalgam fillings during pregnancy and perinatal death are warranted.

AB Criminal justice (CJ) settings disproportionately include populations at high risk for acquiring HIV, and CJ-involved individuals are often at the intersection of multiple overlapping risk factors. However, few studies have examined attitudes about pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among incarcerated men who have sex with men (MSM). This study explored interest in, knowledge of, and barriers to PrEP uptake among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men at the Rhode Island Department of Corrections. Using semi-structured interviews, 26 MSM were interviewed about PrEP knowledge, interest, timing preferences for provision (e.g. before or after release), and barriers to uptake and adherence during community re-entry. Interviews were coded and analyzed using a general inductive approach. Participants demonstrated low initial knowledge of PrEP but high interest after being told more about it. Participants self-identified risk factors for HIV acquisition, including condomless sex and substance use. In addition, participants preferred provision of PrEP prior to release. Post-release barriers to PrEP uptake and adherence included 1) concerns about costs of PrEP medications; 2) anticipated partner or family disapproval; 3) lack of access to transportation; 4) unstable housing; 5) compounding impacts of multiple hardships leading to a de-prioritization of PrEP and 6) fears of future re-incarceration. These results point to the need for future PrEP interventions among incarcerated populations that address incarceration and PrEP related barriers during community re-entry via wraparound services that address PrEP and incarceration-related barriers.

AB Objective
   In the workplace depression and suicide are serious mental health problems. A lack of knowledge and mental health skills along with the stigma toward mental health problems often results in delays in seeking professional help. Interventions targeting not only persons with mental health problems but also people around the individual are warranted in order to encourage supporting behavior within entire workplace. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of our newly developed educational training program in the management with depression and suicidal risk in the workplace as a single-arm pilot trial.
   Methods
   The program is a two-hour (2-h) training course for employees based on the Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) program which aims to increase public mental health literacy. We conducted this program at a company workplace among 91 employees, and ultimately 83 participants completed the self-rated questionnaires. Changes in confidence and practical skills in early intervention of depression and suicide-prevention, and stigma toward mental health problems were evaluated using self-rated questionnaires at 3 time-points; pre-program, immediately post-program, and 1 month after the program.
   Results
   Confidence and practical skills were significantly improved even 1 month after the program, and stigma reduced just after the program.
   Conclusions
   Our pilot study suggests that the program has a positive impact on encouraging employees to support their co-workers with mental health problems, and is applicable for busy workers due to its short duration. A single-arm design, evaluation using self-rated questionnaire and short-term follow up period are the main limitations of the present study. Hence, future research is required to validate the effects of this program with control groups, and also to assess long-term effectiveness and objective changes such as absenteeism and sick leave.

ID QUANTIFICATION
AB Recently, the Act on Guarantee of Right to Health and Access to Medical Service for Persons with Disabilities was implemented to legally define the health care system for persons with disabilities (PWDs) and the guarantee of access to medical care in Korea. This study aimed to develop specific goals and performance indicators to establish a system to guarantee right to health and access to medical service for PWDs. The first procedure was the establishment of the performance indicators, and the second was the content validity verification of the established performance indicators. To establish the performance indicators, we used the policy indicators of the government to improve the health of the Korean people. The indicators that needed to be newly developed were established based on literature review and expert consultation. Three Delphi surveys were conducted to verify the content validity of the established performance indicators. The content validity index (CVI) was obtained for the importance and possibility of the performance indicators. The indicators using the existing policy indicators are "proportion of public health centers" and "rate of health checkup of PWDs," and newly developed indicators are "establishment of facilities for PWDs in health care facilities (buildings and personnel)" and "diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in early childhood (average age and awareness)." The final performance indicators consist of a total of six areas, 22 sub-areas, and 40 individual indicators. The final performance indicators in this study can be used as basic data for continuously identifying the health status of PWDs in Korea and establishing the national policy for their health promotion. This study is also expected to serve as a framework to guarantee the right to health and access to medical service for PWDs rather than simply containing declarative content.

AB BackgroundHand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a major communicable disease in children 6years old, particularly in several countries in the Asia-Pacific Region, including Thailand. HFMD impacts public health and the economy, especially in northern Thailand.MethodsA prospective cohort study was conducted to estimate the incidence rate and to identify the serotype and clinical features of HFMD among children in northern Thailand. A validated questionnaire and throat swab were used for data collection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect human enterovirus and identify its serotypes. Participants were recruited from 14 hospitals in two provinces in northern Thailand, specifically, Chiang Rai and Pha Yao Province, between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2016. Chi-square or Fisher's exact test was used to detect the associations of signs and symptoms with HFMD serotype. Logistic regression was used to detect the associations of variables with a positive enterovirus at alpha=0.05.ResultIn total, 612 children aged 6years from Chiang Rai and Pha Yao Province who were diagnosed with HFMD by a throat swab were recruited for the analysis. Approximately half of the cohort was male (57.2%), 57.5% was aged <2years, and 57.5% lived in rural areas. The incidence rate was 279.72/100,000 person-years in Chiang Rai Province and 321.24 per 100,000 person-years in Pha Yao Province. Additionally, 42.5% of children were positive for human enterovirus; among these children, 56.1% were positive for enterovirus-A (EV-A), 17.7% were positive for coxsackievirus (CV), and 26.2% were positive for other human RNA enteroviruses. During the study period, 21 distinct outbreaks of HFMD were recognized. Four to five patients (total 92 patients) were selected from each outbreak for identifying its serotype; enterovirus-A71 (EV-A71) was detected in 34.8% of HFMD cases, coxsackievirus-A16 (CV-A16) in 26.1%, coxsackivirus-A6 (CV-A6) in 15.2%, coxsackievirus-A10 (CV-A10) in 10.9%, coxsackievirus-A4 (CV-A4) in 2.2%, coxsackievirus-B2 (CV-B2) in 2.2%, human rhinovirus in 2.2%, and unknown serotype in 6.4%. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that a history of breastfeeding for 6months was associated with a higher chance of enterovirus infection than a history of breastfeeding >6months, and children who had mother who worked as farmers, daily wage employees, and unprofessional skilled jobs had a greater chance of enterovirus infection than those who had unemployed mothers. Coxsackievirus-infected children had a higher rate of rashes on the buttocks, knee, and elbow and fever but a lower rate of lethargy and malaise than EV-A71-infected children.ConclusionsEV-A71 is a major cause of HFMD in children <6years old in northern Thailand, but rash, fever, and mouth ulcers are mostly found in participants with coxsackievirus infection. Breastfeeding should be promoted during early childhood for at least 6months to prevent HFMD particularly those mother who are working in unprofessional skill jobs.

AB Background: Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a global public health concern both in developed and developing countries. However, evidences regarding the risk factors of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are limited particularly in Ethiopia. The aim of the study was to assess risk factors associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy among mothers in public hospitals of Tigray.
   Methods: The study was conducted in seven public hospitals of Tigray region, Ethiopia from June 2017 to November 2017. A facility based matched case-control study was employed to select 110 cases and 220 controls who were pregnant women. Cases and controls were matched by parity status. A case was a mother diagnosed to have hypertensive disorders of pregnancy by an obstetrician in the antenatal period while a control was a mother who did not have a diagnosis of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Data were collected by face to face interview technique using a pretested questionnaire and a checklist. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to identify the independent predictor variables. Adjusted matched odds ratio with its corresponding 95% confidence interval was used and significance was claimed at P-value less than 0.05. Overall findings were presented in texts and tables.
   Results: Rural residents were at greater odds of suffering from hypertensive disorders (OR = 3.7, 95% CI; 1.9, 7.1). Similarly, mothers who consume less amount of fruits in their diet had 5 times higher odds of developing hypertensive disorders than those who consume fruits regularly (OR = 5.1, 95% CI; 2.4, 11.15). Overweight (BMI > 25 Kg/m2) mothers were also at risk of developing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy as compared with the normal and underweight mothers (AOR = 5.5 95% CI; 1.12, 27.6). The risk of developing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy was 5.4 times higher among diabetic mothers.
   Conclusion: Rural residence, less fruit consumption, multiple pregnancy, presence of gestational diabetes mellitus and pre-pregnancy overweight were identified as independent risk factors in this study. It is recommended that health care givers may use these factors as a screening tool for the prediction, early diagnoses as well as timely interventions of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.

AB Background: Patient satisfaction to Antenatal care services has traditionally been linked to the quality of services given and the extent to which specific needs are met. Even though data in this area was limited in Ethiopia, improving quality of care was one of the strategies in health sector development program IV. This study, therefore, attempted to assess client satisfaction to skilled antenatal care services in the study area.
   Methods and materials: A cross-sectional facility based survey was conducted among women who were attending antenatal care clinic, using quantitative method triangulated with qualitative data collection. Participants were selected using systematic sampling method according to the flow pregnant women to the antenatal care clinics. The study was carried out in all functional public health centers in the district. During the survey, 405 women were interviewed. A logistic regression model was applied to control for confounders.
   Results: Out of the total respondents, overall satisfied to skilled antenatal care services were about 277(68%). The most common specific component of antenatal care that had good-satisfaction by the respondents was "Privacy" at examination (81.7%). Most satisfied health education session was "Diet and nutrition" session (82.2%). Absence of sonar test, no doctor and long waiting time were commonest causes of dissatisfaction. Respondents who have >= 2 previous antenatal care visit were 3 times more likely (AOR = 2.93; 95% CI, 1.21, 7.12) to have satisfaction to antenatal care services as compared to those with <= 1 visit. Women whose current visit fourth were 9 times more likely (AOR = 9.02, 95% CI; 1.76, 46.1) to be satisfied for antenatal services than those who were in the first visit. Women with family monthly income of $US 25-100 per month were 60% (AOR = 0.4, 95% CI; 0.2, 0.8) less likely to have satisfaction by skilled antenatal care services than those who had monthly household income below $US 25.
   Conclusion and recommendation: Women who reported good-satisfaction to overall skilled antenatal care services were highest as compared to previous Ethiopian study findings. Demographic, economic, obstetric and distance factors were independent predictors of satisfaction to skilled antenatal care services. Non natives must be encouraged to seek satisfying services.

AB BackgroundAcute paediatric poisoning is a common public health concern for both developed and developing countries. The type of agent and underlying cause differ depending on the social, cultural, economic and educational background. The objectives of this study were to identify the incidence and pattern of paediatric poisoning in a rural district in Sri Lanka and establish whether tertiary referral hospital data are a useful surrogate for estimating district level epidemiology of paediatric poisoning.MethodsA subset of epidemiological data were obtained from March 2011 to February 2013 from a randomized controlled trial (SLCTR/2010/008) conducted in 45 hospitals in Kurunegala district.ResultsThe age adjusted annual incidence of all cause of acute poisoning in children aged 1 to 12years in the study area was 60.4 per 100,000. The incidence of poisoning of younger age group (1 to 6years; 76 per 100,000) was significantly higher than older age group (7 to 12years; 41 per 100,000) (p=0.0001) in Kurunegala district. The annual incidence rate of paediatric admissions due to deliberate self-poisoning is 18 per 100,000 population. This study also established that admission data from primary hospitals provided the most accurate epidemiological information on paediatric poisoning.ConclusionsIn rural districts of Sri Lanka, acute paediatric poisoning cases were less frequent and less severe compared to adult poisoning cases (426-446 per 100,000 population). The incidence of poisoning was significantly higher among young children with compared to old children. In this study, deliberate self-poisoning among older children was more frequently seen than in other comparable countries. Because most of the admissions are directed to and managed by primary hospitals, data from referral hospitals alone cannot be used to represent the true incidence of acute poisoning within a district. The data set from all the primary hospitals (n=44) yielded more accurate poisoning incidence amongst a paediatric population.

AB Pakistani women suffer the highest rate of maternal mortality in South Asia. A lack of comprehensive knowledge about maternal and newborn health (MNH) services costs impedes policy decisions to maximize the benefit from existing, as well as emerging, MNH interventions in Pakistan. We compared MNH service costs at different levels of care. A cross-sectional survey was conducted during January to March 2016 as part of a large economic evaluation in Sindh, Pakistan. Health providers and facilities were selected from a sampling frame, inclusive of public and private sectors. This study utilized a broad perspective (i.e. costs to the health system and patients/families). The unit costs of MNH services were determined through a simultaneous allocation method in the public facilities; and patient billing department in the private facilities. Descriptive analysis was performed, and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was applied to compare overall mean costs both within and between health facilities. A total of 31 eligible health providers and facilities (n = 25 in private; n = 7 in public) were included in the final analysis. An ambulatory visit (AV) for routine antenatal care (ANC) costs $3.6 and $0.9 at secondary- and tertiary-level public facilities, respectively. In the private sector, the costs of an AV for ANC were slightly less ($2.8) at secondary-level and much higher ($6) at tertiary-level facilities compared to the public sector. Diagnostic test costs were much higher in private facilities. The average costs of inpatient admissions were $30.5 at general ward (GW), and $151 at the intensive care unit (ICU) in public facilities. In-patient admissions costs were lower such as $9.3 at GW and $36.5 at ICU in private facilities. Understanding cost is critical to guide decisions of resource allocation within the public sector; and risk mitigation for excessive OOP costs through third party payer for services in the private sector.

Twelve health facilities and surrounding communities in the Mbeya Region of Tanzania were randomly assigned to intervention or control arms. Population-level effects were measured through two cross-sectional household surveys of women ages 15-49, at baseline (n = 1,299) and at 28 months following program scale-out (n = 1,250). Delivery of gender-based violence services was assessed through routine recording in health facility registers. Generalized linear mixed effects models and analysis of variance were used to test intervention effects on population and facility outcomes, respectively. At baseline, 52 percent of women reported experience of recent intimate partner violence. The odds of reporting experience of this violence decreased by 29 percent from baseline to follow-up in the absence of the intervention (time effect OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.57-0.89). While the intervention contributed an additional 15 percent reduction, the effect was not statistically significant. The program, however, was found to contribute to positive, community-wide changes including less tolerance for certain forms of violence, more gender equitable norms, better knowledge about gender-based violence, and increased community actions to address violence. The program also led to increased utilization of gender-based violence services at health facilities. Nearly three times as many client visits for gender-based violence were recorded at intervention (N = 1,427) compared to control (N = 489) facilities over a 16-month period. These visits were more likely to include provision of an HIV test (55.3% vs. 19.6%, p = .002). The study demonstrated the feasibility and impact of integrating gender-based violence and HIV programming to combat both of these major public health problems. Further opportunities to scale out GBV prevention and response strategies within HIV/AIDS service delivery platforms should be pursued.

TI 'I should not feed such a weak woman'. Intimate partner violence among
   women living with podoconiosis: A qualitative study in northern Ethiopia
SO PLOS ONE

   MULTICOUNTRY; STRATEGIES; SEX
AB Background
   Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is a serious, preventable public health problem that affects millions of people worldwide. Research indicates that adults suffering from long term, disabling conditions are more likely to be victims of IPV due to the intersection of disease-associated stigma and discrimination. IPV in turn is known to worsen the overall health and wellbeing of those affected by it. Little research however explores the relationship between neglected tropical diseases such as podoconiosis and IPV. This study explores the relationship between IPV and podoconiosis in northern Ethiopia with the aim of identifying new avenues for limiting disability and promoting the wellbeing of people affected by this neglected tropical disease.
   Methods
   The study was conducted in East and West Gojjam zones, located in the Amhara Regional State of Ethiopia. Research participants were first screened using the domestic violence screening tool Hurt-Insult-Threaten-Scream (HITS). Data were collected by native speakers of the local language (Amharic) in the form of semi-structured interviews during January and February 2016. Thematic and content data analysis was carried out, using the Open Code 3.4 qualitative data analysis software for coding.
   Results
   A total of 15 women living with podoconiosis and experiencing IPV were interviewed (aged 31 to 75). Women experienced different forms of IPV, including beatings (with or without an object), insults, name calling, undermining, denial of equal rights over common assets, movement monitoring, cheating, abandonment, forced divorce, obstruction of health care access, inhibition of decision-making and sexual coercion. Podoconiosis increases the frequency and severity of IPV and in occasions shapes a change from physical to psychological and financial violence. In turn, frequent episodes of IPV worsen disease outcomes and contribute to disease persistence in the region, in that these impede women's ability to manage the disease and help perpetuate the conditions of poverty that influence disease onset.
   Conclusions
   Women living with podoconiosis are victims of various, overlapping forms of IPV that negatively impact their health and wellbeing. Poverty, scarce IPV prevention services in the area together with a social acceptance of IPV and these women's decreased ability to work due to the debilitating effects of podoconiosis and childcare responsibilities frequently prompt these women to tolerate IPV and remain in abusive relationships. Tackling disease-associated taboo and stigma, developing accessible IPV interventions, working towards greater gender equality at the household and societal levels and developing sustainable strategies for improving the socio-economic assets of women affected by podoconiosis are all necessary to both prevent IPV and to improve disease outcome.

ID AVAILABILITY; INDICATORS; SERVICES
AB Background: The Lake and Western Zones of Tanzania that encompass eight regions namely; Kagera, Geita, Simiyu, Shinyanga, Mwanza, Mara Tabora and Kigoma have consistently been reported with the poorest Maternal Newborn and Child Health (MNCH) indicators in the country. This study sought to establish the provision of Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC) signal functions and reasons for the failure to do so among health centers and hospitals in the two zones.
   Methods: All the 261 public and private hospitals and health centers providing Obstetric Care services in Lake and Western Zones were surveyed in 2014. Data were collected using questionnaires adapted from the Averting Maternal Deaths and Disabilities (AMDD) tool to assess EmOC indicators. Managers in all facilities were interviewed and services, medicines and equipment were observed. Spatial Mapping was done using a calibrated Global Positioning System (GPS) Essential Software for Android and coordinates represented on digitalized map with Arc Geographical Information System (GIS) software. Population data were according to the 2012 Housing and Population National Census.
   Results: In total 261 health facilities were identified as providers of Obstetric care services, including 69 hospitals and 192 health centres which constitute an overall facility density of 8 per 500,000 population. The three most common EmOC signal functions available in the 3 months preceding the survey were oxytocics (95.7%), injectable antibiotics (88.9%) and basic newborn resuscitation (83.4%). The lowest proportions of facilities performed Cesarean section (25.7%) and blood transfusion (34.6%). Policy restrictions were the most frequent reasons given in relation to nonperformance of blood transfusion and Cesarean section when needed. Lack of training and supplies were the most common reasons for non availability of assisted vaginal delivery and uterine evacuation. Overall the Direct Case fatality Rate for direct obstetric causes was 3%. The referral system highly depended on hired or shared ambulance.
   Conclusion: The provision of EmOC signal functions in Lake and Western zones of Tanzania is inconsistent, being mainly compromised by policy restrictions, lack of supplies and professional development, and by operating under lowly developed referral services.

TI Mechanisms associated with maternal adverse childhood experiences on
   offspring's mental health in Nairobi informal settlements: a mediational
   model testing approach
SO BMC PSYCHIATRY

DT Article
DE Maternal mental health; Adverse childhood experiences; Family stress
   model; Internalizing problems; Externalizing problems; Urban poverty
ID DEPRESSION; BEHAVIOR; STRESS
AB Background: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) is a significant public health and social welfare problem in low-and middle income countries (LMICs). However, most ACEs research is based on developed countries, and little is known about mechanisms of early ACEs on adulthood health and offspring's wellbeing for populations in LMICs. This area is needed to guide social welfare policy and intervention service planning. This study addresses these research gaps by examining patterns of ACEs and understanding the role of ACEs on adulthood health (i.e., physical, mental health, experience of underage pregnancy) and offspring's mental health in Kenya. The study was guided by an Integrated Family Stress and Adverse Childhood Experiences Mediation Framework.
   Methods: Three hundred ninety four mothers from two informal communities in Kariobangi and Kangemi in Nairobi were included in this study. The Adverse Childhood Experiences International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ), the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), Overall Health and Quality of Life items, and Child Behavior Checklist were used to study research questions. Data was gathered through a one-time interview with mothers. Structural Equational Modeling (SEM) was applied for mediational mechanism testing.
   Results: Among 13 ACE areas, most mothers experienced multiple adversity during their childhood (Mean (SD) = 4.93 (2.52)), with household member treated violently (75%) as the most common ACE. SEM results showedthat all domains of ACEs were associated with some aspects of maternal health, and all three domains of maternal health (maternal mental health, physical health, and adolescent pregnancy) were significantly associated with development of offspring's mental health problems.
   Conclusion: ACEs are highly prevalent in Kenyan informal settlements. Consistent with cross cultural literature on family stress model, maternal ACEs are robust predictors for poor child mental health. Preventive interventions for child mental health need to address maternal adverse childhood traumatic experiences as well as their current health in order to effectively promote child mental health.

ID COMMUNITY RESILIENCE; MODEL; COMPLEXITY
AB Background: Emergencies and disasters impact population health. Despite the importance of upstream readiness, a persistent challenge for public health practitioners is defining what it means to be prepared. There is a knowledge gap in that existing frameworks lack consideration for complexity relevant to health systems and the emergency context. The objective of this study is to describe the essential elements of a resilient public health system and how the elements interact as a complex adaptive system.
   Methods: This study used a qualitative design employing the Structured Interview Matrix facilitation technique in six focus groups across Canada. Focus group participants were practitioners from public health and related sectors. Data collection generated qualitative data on the essential elements, and interactions between elements, for a resilient public health system. Data analysis employed qualitative content analysis and the lens of complexity theory to account for the complex nature of public health emergency preparedness (PHEP). The unit of study was the local/regional public health agency. Ethics and values were considered in the development of the framework.
   Results: A total of 130 participants attended the six focus groups. Urban, urban-rural and rural regions from across Canada participated and focus group size ranged from 15 to 33 across the six sites. Eleven elements emerged from the data; these included one cross-cutting element (Governance and leadership) and 10 distinct but interlinked elements. The essential elements define a conceptual framework for PHEP. The framework was refined to ensure practice and policy relevance for local/regional public health agencies; the framework has ethics and values at its core.
   Conclusions: This framework describes the complexity of the system yet moves beyond description to use tenets of complexity to support building resilience. This applied public health framework for local/regional public health agencies is empirically-derived and theoretically-informed and represents a complex adaptive systems approach to upstream readiness for PHEP.

AB Background: There is a lack of robust data about factors predicting continuation (or termination) of positive airway pressure therapy (PAP) for sleep apnea. This analysis of big data from a German homecare provider describes patients treated with PAP, analyzes the therapy termination rate over the first year, and investigates predictive factors for therapy termination.
   Methods: Data from a German homecare service provider were analyzed retrospectively. Patients who had started their first PAP therapy between September 2009 and April 2014 were eligible. Patient demographics, therapy start date, and the date of and reason for therapy termination were obtained. At 1 year, patients were classified as having compliance-related therapy termination or remaining on therapy. These groups were compared, and significant predictors of therapy termination determined.
   Results: Of 98,329 patients included in the analysis, 11,702 (12%) terminated PAP therapy within the first year (after mean 171 +/- 91days). There was a U-shaped relationship between therapy termination and age; therapy termination was higher in the youngest (<30 years, 15.5%) and oldest (>= 80 years, 19.8%) patients, and lower in those aged 50-59 years (9.9%). Therapy termination was significantly more likely in females versus males (hazard ratio 1.48, 95% confidence interval 1.42-1.54), in those with public versus private insurance (1.75, 1.64-1.86) and in patients whose first device was automatically adjusting or fixed-level continuous positive airway pressure versus bilevel or adaptive servo-ventilation (1.28, 1.2-1.38).
   Conclusions: This analysis of the largest dataset investigating PAP therapy termination identified a number of predictive factors. These can help health care providers chose the most appropriate PAP modality, identify specific patient phenotypes at higher risk of stopping PAP and target interventions to support ongoing therapy to these groups, as well as allow them to develop a risk stratification tool.

AB Background
   Excess sugar consumption, including sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), contributes to a variety of negative health outcomes, particularly for young people. The mass media play a powerful role in influencing public and policy-makers' perceptions of public health issues and their solutions. We analysed how sugar and SSB policy debates were presented in UK newspapers at a time of heightened awareness and following the announcement of the UK Government's soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), to inform future public health advocacy.
   Methods & findings
   We carried out quantitative content analysis of articles discussing the issues of sugar and SSB consumption published in 11 national newspapers from April 2015 to November 2016. 684 newspaper articles were analysed using a structured coding frame. Coverage peaked in line with evidence publication, campaigner activities and policy events. Articles predominantly supportive of SSB taxation (23.5%) outnumbered those that were predominantly oppositional (14.2%). However, oppositional articles outnumbered supportive ones in the month of the announcement of the SDIL. Sugar and SSB consumption were presented as health risks, particularly affecting young people, with the actions of industry often identified as the cause of the public health problem. Responsibility for addressing sugar overconsumption was primarily assigned to government intervention.
   Conclusion
   Our results suggest that the policy landscape favouring fiscal solutions to curb sugar and SSB consumption has benefited from media coverage characterising the issue as an industry-driven problem. Media coverage may drive greater public acceptance of the SDIL and any future taxation of products containing sugar. However, future advocacy efforts should note the surge in opposition coinciding with the announcement of the SDIL, which echoes similar patterns of opposition observed in tobacco control debates.

SO PLOS ONE

AB Background Obesity is a critical public health issue, affecting over one-third of all Americans, and is an underlying cause of numerous health issues across the lifespan. For older adults, obesity is linked to premature declines in physical and mental health and cognitive functioning. The occurrence of obesity and related health behaviors and chronic diseases are higher in rural areas than in urban areas. Furthermore, rural areas of the United States have a higher proportion of older adults than urban areas. Few studies, to date, have explored rural-urban differences in the relationships between dietary patterns and obesity among older adults. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess rural-urban differences in obesity rates in older adults, and the potential for the associations between obesity and physical activity and dietary patterns to vary by rural-urban status.
   Methods Data were abstracted from respondents aged 65 and above from the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) database linked to Census-based county-level information on rural-urban status and socioeconomic status. Generalized linear models were utilized to assess rural-urban disparities in obesity, and the potential for associations between obesity and known risk factors (fruit consumption, green vegetable consumption and physical activity) to vary by rural-urban status, accounting for complex sampling and confounders.
   Results Obesity rates were highest and fruit consumption was lowest in the most rural areas. However, for older adults in the most urban areas, there was a significant negative association between obesity and fruit and green vegetable consumption. This association was not observed in more rural older adults.
   Conclusion These findings underscore the need to take into account place-based factors such as rural-urban status, when designing and implementing policies and interventions designed to reduce obesity through risk factor mitigation in older adults. To reduce rural-urban disparities in older adults, all policies, programs, and interventions should address the unique barriers and needs specific to rural and urban older adults.

TI Magnitude and factors associated with late antenatal care booking on
   first visit among pregnant women in public health centers in central
   zone of Tigray Region, Ethiopia: A cross sectional study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   Antenatal care (ANC) is a care given for pregnant women and is a good opportunity to deliver maternal health interventions. Even though pregnant women should start their first antenatal care within 12 weeks of gestational age, many pregnant women start their first ANC late. So, the aim of this study is to determine magnitude of late ANC booking at first visit and factors associated with it.
   Methods
   Institutional based cross sectional study design was conducted in central zone of Tigray Region, Ethiopia from November 1/2017 to January 30/2018 among total of 632 pregnant women. Stratified multi stage cluster sampling method was used to select health centers and systematic random sampling technique was used during the selection of study units. Data were collected using interview administer questionnaire by face to face. The collected data were entered into EPI info-7. Later on, it was exported to STATA-14 for further analysis. Proportion was used to estimate the magnitude of late ANC booking. Bivariable and multi-variable analysis were done to see factors associated with the magnitude of late ANC booking.
   Results
   The magnitude of late ANC booking at first visit were 85.67% (95%, CI: 82.89, 88.45). Factors that were independently associated with the late ANC booking at first visit in multivariable analysis were; having home delivery in previous delivery (AOR = 2.2, 95%, CI: 1.1, 4.49), women who had no previous ANC follow up (AOR = 3.43, 95%, CI: 1.32, 8.92) and women with poor knowledge about the advantage and service availability of ANC (AOR = 3.9, 95%, CI: 1.83, 8.29).
   Conclusion
   In summary, most of pregnant women were not started their first ANC at the recommended time. Home delivery and history of ANC in previous pregnancy as well as women with poor knowledge about ANC were associated with late ANC booking at first visit. Health workers should work on avoiding home delivery and increasing the knowledge of pregnant women on ANC may help on reducing late ANC booking at first visit.

TI Screening, diagnosis, and long-term health outcomes in developing
   countries-The case of hypertension
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID EDUCATION; HEIGHT
AB Hypertension is a rapidly growing problem in developing countries. At the same time, due to its asymptomatic nature, the afflicted population is largely unaware of being hypertensive. Due to a lack of resources, routine medical exams are very rare in developing countries and many sick individuals remain undiagnosed. Using a large sample of hypertensive individuals from Indonesia, we show the importance of being diagnosed. Diagnosed individuals exhibit lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and overall lower probability of remaining hypertensive than undiagnosed individuals. We also show the main channels through which this is achieved: taking medication, routinely monitoring one's blood pressure, and engaging in moderate physical activities. We also point to channels through which additional benefits could be realized, but that are currently ineffective: dietary changes and maintaining a healthy body weight. Combined, these results point to the importance of directing public policy towards addressing the under-diagnosis problem and educating the public of the benefits of adopting a healthy life-style.

AB Background
   The Philippines is experiencing one of the fastest growing epidemics globally. Evidence-based public health policies are needed. To describe the public health literature on HIV risk groups and prevention approaches in the Philippines, we reviewed published empirical studies with HIV-related outcomes.
   Methods
   Based on an a priori systematic review protocol, we searched PubMed, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases for quantitative studies conducted in the Philippines that reported on HIV risk groups factors and interventions to prevent HIV. The search included studies published as of April 2018.
   Results
   We identified 755 records, screened 699 unique titles and abstracts, and conducted full text review of 122 full reports of which 51 articles met inclusion criteria. The majority were cross-sectional studies describing HIV and STI prevalence and risk factors in samples recruited from the Philippines. Four HIV prevention programs conducted in the Philippines were identified, all of which reported improvements on HIV knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Overall, female sex workers (FSWs) constituted the primary study population, and few studies reported data from men who have sex with men (MSM), people who inject drugs (PWIDs), and youth. No studies reported on transgender populations. Most studies were focused on examining condom use-related outcomes and STI history, few had biomarkers for HIV, and none addressed biomedical HIV prevention strategies.
   Conclusion
   This review identifies an agenda for future HIV research that is needed to address the growing and shifting nature of the HIV epidemic in the Philippines.

AB Objectives
   To evaluate patients' sense of responsibility to healthcare providers and to determine its predictors using on a national sample in China.
   Methods
   We conducted a national cross-sectional survey in China with a stratified cluster sample of patients treated in 77 hospitals between July 2014 and April 2015. Patients' sense of responsibility to healthcare providers was measured with four questions assessing patients' perceptions regarding their responsibilities to respect doctors, respect nurses, coordinate with health professionals, and comply with hospital rules. Predictors included patient socio-demographic characteristics and their past hospitalization experience.
   Results
   Small proportions of respondents reported that they perceived having no responsibility to respect doctors (8.9%), respect nurses (7.9%), comply with hospital rules (6.7%), or coordinate with health professionals (6.3%). Multivariate regression analyses showed that the strongest predictor of patients' sense of responsibility to healthcare providers was patinets' trust in health professionals, followed by patients' education level. Familiarity with healthcare professionals and past hospitalization frequency were inversely associated with patients' sense of responsibility to healthcare providers.
   Conclusions
   Although only a small proportion of the patients reported feeling no or low sense of responsibility to healthcare providers, the lack of respect and collaboration from these patients can negatively affect patient-provider relationships. Healthcare administrators need to communicate clearly with the patients and the public about the role of patients and the limitations of medicine in order to instill a sense of patients' responsibility.

AB BackgroundRapid and accurate identification of Verotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) O157:H7 is dependent on well-established, standardized and highly discriminatory typing methods. Currently, conventional subtyping tests for foodborne bacterial pathogen surveillance are rapidly being replaced with whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in public health laboratories. The capacity of WGS to revolutionize global foodborne disease surveillance has positioned this tool to become the new gold standard; however, to ensure evidence standards for public health decision making can still be achieved, the performance of WGS must be thoroughly validated against current gold standard methods prior to implementation. Here we aim to verify the performance of WGS in comparison to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) for eight retrospective outbreaks of VTEC O157:H7 from the Canadian perspective. Since real-time implementation and routine use of WGS in public health laboratories is highly reliant on standardized data analysis tools, we also provide a comparative analysis of two popular methodologies for WGS analyses; an in-house developed single nucleotide variant phylogenomics (SNVPhyl) pipeline and the BioNumerics whole genome multilocus sequence typing (wgMLST) tool. To provide a useful and consistent starting point for examining laboratory-based surveillance data for VTEC O157:H7 in Canada, we also aim to describe the number of genetic differences observed among outbreak-associated isolates.ResultsWGS provided enhanced resolution over traditional subtyping methods, and accurately distinguished outbreak-related isolates from non-outbreak related isolates with high epidemiological concordance. WGS also illuminated potential linkages between sporadic cases of illness and contaminated food, and isolates spanning multiple years. The topologies generated by SNVPhyl and wgMLST were highly congruent with strong statistical support. Few genetic differences were observed among outbreak-related isolates (5 SNVs/ <10 wgMLST alleles) unless the outbreak was suspected to be multi-strain.ConclusionsThis study validates the superiority of WGS and indicates the BioNumerics wgMLST schema is suitable for surveillance and cluster detection of VTEC O157:H7. These findings will provide a useful and consistent starting point for examining WGS data for prospective laboratory-based surveillance of VTEC O157:H7, but however, the data will continue to be interpreted according to context and in combination with epidemiological and food safety evidence to inform public-health decision making in Canada.

AB BackgroundCorynebacterium diphtheriae is the main etiological agent of diphtheria, a global disease causing life-threatening infections, particularly in infants and children. Vaccination with diphtheria toxoid protects against infection with potent toxin producing strains. However a growing number of apparently non-toxigenic but potentially invasive C. diphtheriae strains are identified in countries with low prevalence of diphtheria, raising key questions about genomic structures and population dynamics of the species. This study examined genomic diversity among 48 C. diphtheriae isolates collected in Australia over a 12-year period using whole genome sequencing. Phylogeny was determined using SNP-based mapping and genome wide analysis.ResultsC. diphtheriae sequence type (ST) 32, a non-toxigenic clone with evidence of enhanced virulence that has been also circulating in Europe, appears to be endemic in Australia. Isolates from temporospatially related patients displayed the same ST and similarity in their core genomes. The genome-wide analysis highlighted a role of pilins, adhesion factors and iron utilization in infections caused by non-toxigenic strains.ConclusionsThe genomic diversity of toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains of C. diphtheriae in Australia suggests multiple sources of infection and colonisation. Genomic surveillance of co-circulating toxigenic and non-toxigenic C. diphtheriae offer new insights into the evolution and virulence of pathogenic clones and can inform targeted public health actions and policy. The genomes presented in this investigation will contribute to the global surveillance of C. diphtheriae both for the monitoring of antibiotic resistance genes and virulent strains such as those belonging to ST32.

AB BackgroundLoneliness is a public health concern with serious health consequences in older adults. Despite a large body of research on the correlates of loneliness, little is known about the age group differences in the correlates. Given that the older adult population is heterogeneous, this study aims to examine the correlates of loneliness in older adults in Shanghai, and to explore how the correlates vary across different age groups.MethodsWe used the Shanghai Urban Neighborhood Survey (SUNS) which was conducted in 2016 and 2017. The total sample size of older adults included in the analysis was 2770. Loneliness was measured using the sum of the 6 items derived from the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale. Correlates include demographic variables, health conditions, social factors, and new media use. Regression analysis was used to examine the correlates of loneliness first in the whole sample, and then in the young old (60-79years old) and the old old (80+ years old) separately.ResultsThe mean of loneliness score was 18.48 (SD=5.77). The old old reported a higher level of loneliness than the young old. Variables, including age, living arrangement, marital status, education, health, family functioning, volunteering, square dancing, and new media use were found to be significant in the whole sample. Most of the significant correlates observed in the young old were identical to the findings reported for the total sample, with an exception for living arrangement. Self-rated health (SRH) and family functioning were two important correlates for the old old.ConclusionsCorrelates of loneliness vary for the young old and the old old. The older adults at higher risk of loneliness deserve more attention and concern. Future interventions should be tailored to the young old and the old old to better help older adults alleviate loneliness and enhance their well-being.

AB BackgroundGlobally, neonatal mortality remains high despite interventions known to reduce neonatal deaths. The All Babies Count (ABC) initiative was a comprehensive health systems strengthening intervention designed by Partners In Health in collaboration with the Rwanda Ministry of Health to improve neonatal care in rural public facilities. ABC included provision of training, essential equipment, and a quality improvement (QI) initiative which combined clinical and QI mentorship within a learning collaborative. We describe ABC implementation outcomes, including development of a QI change package.MethodsABC was implemented over 18months from 2013 to 2015 in two Rwandan districts of Kirehe and Southern Kayonza, serving approximately 500,000 people with 24 nurse-led health centers and 2 district hospitals. A process evaluation of ABC implementation and its impact on healthcare worker (HCW) attitudes and QI practice was done using program documents, standardized surveys and focus groups with facility QI team members attending ABC Learning Sessions. The Change Package was developed using mixed methods to identify projects with significant change according to quantitative indicators and qualitative feedback obtained during focus group discussions. Outcome measures included ABC implementation process measures, HCW-reported impact on attitudes and practice of QI, and resulting change package developed for antenatal care, delivery management and postnatal care.ResultsABC was implemented across all 26 facilities with an average of 0.76 mentorship visits/facility/month and 118 tested QI change ideas. HCWs reported a reduction in barriers to quality care delivery related to training (p=0.018); increased QI capacity (knowledge 37 to 89%, p<0.001); confidence (47 to 89%, p<0.001), QI leadership (59 to 91%, p<0.001); and peer-to-peer learning (37 to 66%, p=0.024). The final change package included 46 change ideas. Themes associated with higher impact changes included provision of mentorship and facility readiness support through equipment provision.ConclusionsABC provides a feasible model of an integrated approach to QI in rural Rwanda. This model resulted in increases in HCW and facility capacity to design and implement effective QI projects and facilitated peer-to-peer learning. ABC and the change package are being scaled to accelerate improvement in neonatal outcomes.

ID MYANMAR; TRENDS
AB Malaria transmission is highly heterogeneous through time and space, and mapping of this heterogeneity is necessary to better understand local dynamics. New targeted policies are needed as numerous countries have placed malaria elimination on their public health agenda for 2030. In this context, developing national health information systems and collecting information at sufficiently precise scales (at least at the week' and village' scales), is of strategic importance. In a recent study, Macharia et al. relied on extensive prevalence survey data to develop malaria risk maps for Kenya, including uncertainty assessments specifically designed to support decision-making by the National Malaria Control Program. Targeting local persistent transmission or epidemiologic changes is necessary to maintain efficient control, but also to deploy sustainable elimination strategies against identified transmission bottlenecks such as the reservoir of subpatent infections. Such decision-making tools are paramount to allocate resources based on sound scientific evidence and public health priorities.Please see related article: https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-018-2489-9.

AB BackgroundChronic Kidney Disease (CKD), the worldwide Public Health problem, is also one of the rising non-communicable diseases in low and middle-income countries. Its early detection and treatment using readily available, inexpensive therapies can slow or prevent progression to end-stage renal disease. Hence, this study was aimed at assessing impaired estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), high grade albuminuria, and associated factors among adult patients admitted to Jimma University Medical Center in South west Ethiopia.MethodsHospital based cross sectional study was conducted from November 1, 2016 to April 30, 2017. Consecutive sampling method was used to select study participants. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to generate factors associated with impaired estimated GFR and albuminuria. A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsThe study involved 422 patients admitted to Jimma University Medical Center who had at least one test result for urinalysis and serum creatinine level during the study period. Fifty two (12.3%) of the study subjects had high grade albuminuria, 19.2, 19.4, and 32.7% had impaired estimated glomerular filtration rate according to Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD-4), Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology (CKD-EPI), and Cockcroft-Gault (CG) equations respectively. Old age (AOR=2.4;95%CI:1.4-4.01), male sex (AOR=2.1;95%CI:1.16-3.7), and hypertension (AOR=2.23; 95%CI:1.24-4.01) were independently associated with impaired eGFR using one of the two equations while diabetes mellitus (AOR=2.8; 95%CI:1.33-5.82) and BP measurement above optimal (AOR=4.7; 95%CI:1.9-11.53) were associated with high grade albuminuria.ConclusionsHigh grade albuminuria and impaired eGFR were found in significant proportion of adults admitted to the hospital for various medical conditions. Old age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and male gender were independently associated with these alterations. These findings necessitate routine urinalysis and estimation of GFR for all hospitalized adults with known CKD risk factors.

AB Background: Oral diseases may cause serious health problems, especially in socially disadvantaged populations and in low-income countries. In populations living in the rural areas of Tanzania there is paucity of reports on oral health. The study aim was to estimate the prevalence, severity and socio-demographic distribution of oral diseases/conditions in adolescents living in Maasai population areas of Tanzania and to compare oral diseases/conditions between Maasai and non-Maasai ethnic groups.
   Methods: A total of 23 schools were randomly selected from 66 rural public primary schools in Monduli and Longido districts, Tanzania. All pupils in the selected classes, 6th grade, were invited to participate in the study. A total of 989 were invited and 906 (91.6%) accepted the invitation and completed an interview and a clinical oral examination.
   Results: Out of 906 study participants (age range 12-17years), 721(79.6%) were from Maasai and 185 (20.4%) from non-Maasai ethnic groups. Prevalence of poor oral hygiene, gingival bleeding, dental caries experience (DMFT > 0), dental fluorosis TF grade 5-9, dental erosion (into dentin), tooth wear (into dentin) and TMD was 65.6, 40.9, 8.8, 48.6, 1.9, 16.5 and 11.8%, respectively. Multiple variable logistic regression analysis revealed that, girls (OR = 2.0) and participants from Longido (OR = 2.6) were more likely to present with good oral hygiene (p < 0.05). Adolescents from Monduli (OR = 1.7), males (OR = 2.1), being born within Arusha region (OR = 1.9) and Maasai (OR = 1.7) were more likely to present with gingival bleeding (p < 0.05). DMFT > 0 increased by age (OR = 2.0) and was associated with non-Maasai ethnic group (OR = 2.2), (p < 0.05). Adolescents from Monduli district (OR = 10.0) and those born in Arusha region (OR = 3.2) were more likely to present with dental fluorosis (p < 0.05). Dental erosion was more common among non-Maasais (OR = 2.0) as well as having mother with high education (OR = 2.3), (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Oral diseases like dental caries and dental erosion were less common, but gingival bleeding, dental fluorosis, tooth wear and TMD were common findings in adolescents attending primary schools in the Maasai population areas of Tanzania. Notable differences between Maasai and non-Maasai ethnic groups and certain correlations to sociodemographic factors were detected. Our findings can be utilized by policy makers in the planning of oral health programs in public primary schools of Maasai population areas of Tanzania.

AB The Yemen cholera outbreak has been driven by years of conflict and has now become the largest in epidemiologically recorded history with more than 1.2 million cases since the beginning of the outbreak in April, 2017. In this report we review and discuss the cholera management strategies applied by the major international humanitarian health organizations present in Yemen. We find the response by the organizations examined to have been more focused on case management than on outbreak prevention. Oral Cholera Vaccines (OCVs) were not delivered until nearly 16months into the outbreak. A recent scale-up of the global OCV stockpile will hopefully allow for rapid mass deployment of the OCV in future humanitarian emergencies. Continuous funding to this stockpile will be crucial to maintain this option for prevention and control of cholera outbreaks. Of equal importance will be the timely recognition of the need for mass OCV deployment and development of more specific, comprehensive and actionable evidence-based frameworks to help guide this decision, however difficult this may be. The outbreak highlights the importance for international humanitarian health organizations to have a continuous discussion about whether and to what extent they should increase their focus on pre-emptively addressing the environmental determinants of communicable diseases in humanitarian emergencies. Strong advocacy from the public health community for peace and the protection of human health, by bringing to attention the public health impacts of armed conflict and keeping the world's political leaders accountable to their actions, will remain crucial.

AB BackgroundEvidence suggests that young females are more likely to try to lose weight than young males, however whether this sex difference persists across demographic characteristics and weight status is unclear. Further, whether females are more likely than males to try to lose weight using unhealthy weight loss strategies has never been systematically assessed. The objective of this systematic review was to examine the literature on sex differences in weight loss intentions and strategies in children and adolescent observational studies to determine whether sex differences persisted across demographic characteristics (race/ethnicity, grade level) and weight status.MethodsRelevant articles published after 1990 were identified using PubMED, Web of Science, and PsycInfo. Searches were conducted in May of 2015 and again in May of 2017. Studies conducted in the US and Canada with participants 18-years old or younger who measured weight loss strategies in the context of weight loss intention were selected. Descriptive statistics were extracted from 19 studies.ResultsAlmost two-thirds of youth reported trying to lose weight. High-school and middle-school aged females reported consistently higher prevalence of weight loss intentions compared to male counterparts, as did Caucasian, African-American, and Hispanic females. The proportion of youth using unhealthy or extreme strategies reached 44 and 13%, respectively, with a similar proportion of males and females endorsing the use of each category of weight loss strategies across studies. Native-American youth reported the highest prevalence (27%) of using extreme strategies.ConclusionsResearchers should consider demographic characteristics when reporting prevalence information for weight loss intentions and behaviours, as certain groups might require more targeted public health initiatives. Across characteristics, prevalence ranges were broad for weight loss intentions and use of particular strategies, suggesting the need to standardize and refine data collection and reporting practices in this literature.

TI Socioeconomic variation in injury hospitalisations in Australian

SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH

DT Article
DE Socioeconomic disadvantage; Childhood injury; Hospitalisation
ID RISK-FACTORS; SELF-HARM
AB BackgroundChildhood injury remains a significant public health problem responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. However, injury has been found to increase with socioeconomic disadvantage for some injuries. The current study examines the 10-year epidemiological profile of injury hospitalisations of children 16years by socioeconomic status for different age group and select types of injury.MethodA retrospective analysis of injury hospitalisations of children aged 16years using linked hospitalisation and mortality records during 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2012 was conducted. Negative binomial regression was used to calculate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for injury hospitalisation rates by socioeconomic disadvantage quintile.ResultsThere were 679,171 injury hospitalisations for children aged 0-16years in Australia. Children in more disadvantaged socioeconomic quintiles were more likely to be hospitalised for an injury sustained by: assault (IRR range 1.40 to 3.64), poisoning (IRR range 1.29 to 1.36), heat and hot substances (IRR range 1.07 to 1.34), and pedestrian collisions (IRR range 1.06 to 1.54) than children in advantaged socioeconomic quintiles.ConclusionsFindings support the notion that the risk of injury hospitalisation among children differs according to socioeconomic gradient and has implications for childhood injury prevention. Policy makers should consider socioeconomic differences in the design of injury prevention measures, particularly measures directed at modifying the built environment and home-based interventions.

AB BackgroundThe primary aim of this study was to examine the associations of normal weight obesity (NWO) with physical fitness in Chinese university students. As a secondary aim, we assessed whether possible differences in physical fitness between students classified as NWO and normal weight non-obese (NWNO) were mediated by skeletal muscles mass.MethodsA total of 383 students (205 males and 178 females, aged 18-24years) from two universities volunteered to participate in this study. Body height and weight were measured by standard procedures and body composition was assessed by bio-impedance analysis (InBody 720). NWO was defined by a BMI of 18.5-23.9kg/m(2) and a body fat percentage of >20% or>30% in male and female students, respectively. Physical fitness was measured using a 10-min intermittent endurance running test (Andersen test), countermovement jumps (CMJ) and a 5x5m shuttle run test (5mSR). The level of leisure time physical activity (PA) was assessed by a questionnaire.Results13.7% of male and 27.5% of female students were classified as NWO. Compared to NWNO, students classified as NWO showed a significantly poorer performance in the Andersen test (males: 114670m vs. 1046 +/- 95m, females: 968 +/- 61m vs. 907 +/- 67m, p<0.001), CMJ (males: 55.0 +/- 7.6cm vs. 44.9 +/- 7.5cm, females: 39.8 +/- 8.0cm vs. 33.7 +/- 5.9cm, p<0.001) and 5mSR (males: 18.7 +/- 1.0s vs. 20.0 +/- 0.9s, females: 21.1 +/- 1.1s vs. 22.4 +/- 1.3s, p<0.001), respectively. The lower levels of physical fitness in NWO were partially explained by lower skeletal muscle mass (p<0.001) both in male and female students.Conclusions p id=Par4 NWO was associated with poorer physical fitness and the relationship was partially mediated by lower skeletal muscle mass. The study indicated that attention should be paid for the potential hidden health risk in university students with normal body mass index but excessive fat mass.

AB BackgroundThis study was conducted in order to determine the prevalence of asthma and associated risk factors in the adult population of Karachi, Pakistan.MethodsThis multi-stage, cross-sectional survey was conducted from May 2014-August 2015; comprising 1629 adults in 75 randomly selected clusters in Karachi, Pakistan. Definitions included: self-reported asthma', reversibility in FEV1' and respiratory symptoms and reversibility in FEV1'.ResultsPrevalence of asthma was 1.8% (self-reported) (95% CI: 1.0-2.6), 11.3% (reversibility in FEV1) (95% CI: 9.4-13.3) and 6.6% (symptoms and reversibility in FEV1) (95% CI: 5.1-8.1). Asthmatics were more likely to belong to the age group 38years according to reversibility in FEV1' and respiratory symptoms and reversibility in FEV1' (AOR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.2-3.3) and (AOR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.1-4.2), respectively. Asthmatics were more likely to report history of allergies (AOR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.2-2.9) and (AOR: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.7-4.8); and were exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (AOR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.1-2.5) and (AOR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.1-3.3) according to reversibility in FEV1' and respiratory symptoms and reversibility in FEV1', respectively. Asthmatics were more likely to report pack years of smoking 5 (AOR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1-4.7) according to respiratory symptoms and reversibility in FEV1'.ConclusionThis study reports a high prevalence of asthma among Pakistani adults and calls for developing appropriate public health policies for prevention and control of asthma in the country. Further studies should be conducted to determine the national prevalence as well as follow-up studies to identify preventable causes for adult asthma.

ID FOREIGN-AID; SUPPORT; CHINA
AB Governments in high income countries allocate funding for Official Development Assistance (ODA), and population-based surveys tend to show support for the concept of affluent nations assisting the development of poorer regions. A public opinion survey was conducted in Hong Kong to: (1) assess public support for foreign aid for social development and Hong Kong's current Disaster Relief Fund (DRF); and (2) assess how much respondents thought should be contributed to foreign aid for social development and/or DRF. Interviewers conducted a random telephone survey of Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong citizens aged 18 or above during 2017. Of the 1004 individuals surveyed, 55% (552) agreed that a portion of the government budget should be allocated to the DRF and 37% (372) disagreed. The mean and the median amount of the government budget suggested to be allocated were 5.1% and 2.4% respectively. However only 16% (164) supported the government giving foreign aid for social development, with 79% (793) not supporting, and 5% (47) undecided. The suggested portions of government budget that should be allocated for this purpose were 1.5% (mean) and 0.0% (median). The degree of support for DRF and foreign aid for social development was associated with both age (DRF P < 0.0005; foreign aid for social development P < 0.0005) and education (DRF P = 0.010; foreign aid for social development: P < 0.0005). There was little support for foreign aid for social development amongst the Hong Kong public, in contrast to similar surveys in other countries, but this could be related to the lack of a local tradition of providing ODA to foreign countries. Most respondents supported the current DRF and would like to see a greater proportion of government budget allocated.

ID BODY AWARENESS; ET-AL.; ACCURACY; MINDFULNESS; SENSIBILITY
AB Interoception, the process by which the nervous system senses, interprets, and integrates signals originating from within the body, has become major research topic for mental health and in particular for mind-body interventions. Interoceptive awareness here is defined as the conscious level of interoception with its multiple dimensions potentially accessible to self-report. The Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) is an 8-scale state-trait questionnaire with 32 items to measure multiple dimensions of interoception by self-report and was published in November 2012. Its numerous applications in English and other languages revealed low internal consistency reliability for two of its scales. This study's objective was to improve these scales and the psychometrics of the MAIA by adding three new items to each of the two scales and evaluate these in a new sample. Data were collected within a larger project that took place as part of the Live Science residency programme at the Science Museum London, UK, where visitors to the museum (N = 1,090) completed the MAIA and the six additional items. Based on exploratory factor analysis in one-half of the adult participants and Cronbach alphas, we discarded one and included five of the six additional items into a Version 2 of the MAIA and conducted confirmatory factor analysis in the other half of the participants. The 8-factor model of the resulting 37-item MAIA-2 was confirmed with appropriate fit indices (RMSEA = 0.055 [95% CI 0.052-0.058]; SRMR = 0.064) and improved internal consistency reliability. The MAIA-2 is public domain and available (www.osher.ucsf.edu/maia) for interoception research and the evaluation of clinical mind-body interventions.

AB BackgroundOver the past two decades, there has been a decrease in dental diseases in Australia; however, the number of preventable dental hospital admissions has not diminished. This review reports on the factors associated with preventable dental hospital admissions in Australia.MethodsA search of five databases was conducted using Medical subject headings/Emtree terms and Index terms. All original studies, published between January1965 and March 2018 in English, based on the Australian population, and examining the prevalence of oral conditions as a cause for emergency department presentations and hospital admissions were included. The mixed method appraisal tool was used to evaluate the included studies.ResultsEleven cross-sectional studies met inclusion and exclusion criteria. All the studies, except one from Tasmania, were from Western Australia. The most common reasons for preventable dental hospital admissions were dental caries, followed by embedded or impacted teeth. Malignant neoplasms were reported as main causes of preventable dental hospital admissions in the older population.ConclusionsMost studies on preventable dental hospital admissions were from one Australian state (Western Australia). Further research is required to determine the national prevalence and incidence of preventable dental hospital admissions. A periodic audit of preventable dental hospital admission data is needed for delivery of a fair and effective dental services.

AB BackgroundThe sale of antibiotics without a prescription poses a global public health concern. Antibiotics dispensed without a prescription are largely recognised as a cause of antibiotic misuse and overuse which may result in antibiotic resistance, recurrent infection, increased cost and adverse effects of treatment. There have been no qualitative studies to explore the reasons for over-the-counter (OTC) sale of antibiotics, despite the fact that non-prescription sale of antibiotics are increasing in Saudi Arabia.MethodsQualitative interviews were conducted with community pharmacists living in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia using face-to-face, open-ended questions. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The interview transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis and NVivo 10 software.ResultsAll participants declared that antibiotics were frequently sold without a medical prescription on an OTC basis. The main reasons for OTC sale of antibiotics were found to be related to the ease of access to community pharmacies compared to other healthcare services, expertise and knowledge of pharmacists and patients' trust, misconceptions and inappropriate practices of the public towards antibiotic use, customer pressure, pharmacists' need to ensure business survival and weak regulatory enforcement mechanism. These are presented in more detail below by using illustrative quotes from participants' transcripts.ConclusionsThe non-prescribed sale of antibiotics is still a common practice in Saudi Arabia, despite being a problem. The results of this study highlight the need to design interventions to promote rational use of antibiotics.

ID 6 SIGMA; CARE; QUALITY; HEALTH; METHODOLOGY; OPERATIONS
AB BackgroundThroughout the world, emergency departments (ED) are characterized by overcrowding and excessive waiting times. Furthermore, the related delays significantly increase patient mortality and make inefficient use of resources to the detriment of the satisfaction of employees and patients. In this work, lean thinking is applied to the ED of Cardarelli Hospital of Naples with the aim of increasing patient flow, improving the processes that contribute to facilitating the flow of patients through the various stages of medical treatment and eliminating all bottlenecks (queue) as well as all activities that generate waste.MethodsThis project was performed at National Hospital A.O.R.N. A. Cardarelli of Naples. The historical times of access to the ED were analysed from January 2015 to June 2015, for a total of 16,563 records. Subsequently, starting in November 2015, corrective actions were implemented according to the Lean Approach. Data collected after the introduced improvements were collected from April 2016 to June 2016 and compared to those collected during the starting period.ResultsThe results acquired before application of the Lean Thinking strategy illustrated the as-is process with its drawbacks. An analysis of the non-added value activities was performed to identify the procedures that need to be improved. After implementation of the corrective actions, we observed a positive increase in the performance of the ED, quantified as percentages of hospitalized patients according to triage codes and waiting times.ConclusionThis work demonstrates the applicability of Lean Thinking to ED processes and its effectiveness in terms of increasing the efficiency of services and reducing waste (waiting times).

AB BackgroundAntenatal care (ANC) is provided for free in Tanzania in all public health facilities. Yet surveys suggested that long distances to the facilities limit women from accessing these services. Mobile health clinics (MHC) were introduced to address this problem; however, little is known about the client cost and time associated with utilizing ANC at MHC and whether these costs deter women from using the provided services.MethodsClient-exit interviews were conducted by interviewing 293 pregnant women who visited the MHC in rural Tanzania. Two subgroups were created, one with women who travelled more than 1.5h to the MHC, and the other with women who travelled within 1.5h. For each subgroup we estimated the direct cost in US$ and time in hours for utilizing services and they hinder service utilization. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank sum test was performed to compare the differences between the estimated mean values in the two groups.ResultTotal direct cost per visit was: US$2.27 (SD=0.90) for overall, US$2.29 (SD=1.03) for those women who travelled less than 1.5h and US$2.53 (SD=0.63) for those who travelled more than 1.5h (p=0.08). Laboratory and medicine cost accounted for 70 and 16% of the total direct cost and were similar across the groups. Total time cost per visit (in hours) was: 3.75 (SD=1.83), 2.88 (SD=1.27) for those women who travelled less than 1.5h and 5.02 (SD=1.81) for those who travelled more than 1.5h (p<0.01). The major contributor of time cost was waiting time; 1.89 (SD=1.29) for overall, 1.68 (SD=1.02) for those women who travelled less than 1.5h and 2.17 (SD=1.57) for those who travelled more than 1.5h (p=0.07). Participants reported having missed their scheduled visit due to lack of money (15%) and time (9%).ConclusionWomen receiving nominally free ANC incur considerable time and direct cost, which may result in an unsteady use of maternal care. Improving availability of essential medicine and supplies at health facilities, as well as focusing on efficient utilization of community health workers may reduce these costs.

AB BackgroundBrucellosis is a neglected debilitating zoonosis with a high prevalence in many developing countries. Bovine brucellosis is widespread in Cameroon but the epidemiological situation of human brucellosis is not known. A cross sectional study was carried to determine the seroprevalence and factors associated with bovine and human Brucellosis among abattoir personnel and pregnant women in Ngaoundere, Cameroon.MethodsSerum sample from 590 abattoir cattle and 816 plausible occupational risk and vulnerable humans to brucellosis (107 abattoir personnel and 709 pregnant women) were collected and screened for anti-brucella antibodies using Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT) and ELISA tests. Structured questionnaires were used to collect data on socio-demographics and risk-factors. The differences in proportions between seropositive and seronegative reactors were tested using odds-ratio and (2)tests.ResultsBovine brucellosis seroprevalence was at 3.40% (n=590; 3.4% for RBPT, 5.93% for i-ELISA). Human Brucella seroprevalence was at 5.6% among abattoir personnel (n=107; 5.6% for RBPT, 12.15% for Brucella IgG ELISA) and 0.28% in pregnant women (n=709; both tests). Breed (P<0.00001) was associated with increased risk of brucellosis in cattle and the seroprevalence was highest among the Djafoun (OR=16.67, 95%CI: 4.49-28.85) and Akou (OR=16.96, 95% CI: 0.10-23.91) cattle compared to the other breeds. There was a moderate positive correlation (R-2=0.5025) of Brucella IgG concentrations (>200U/ml) and clinical data for Brucella IgG ELISA seropositive humans. Several potential factors were associated (P>0.05) with increased risk of human brucellosis seroprevalence among the abattoir personnel. The abattoir personnel were essentially males; the seropositive respondents were male and did not use protective equipment at work. Handling of foetus and uterine contents (OR=13.00, 95%CI: 1.51-111.88) was associated with increased risk of human brucellosis.ConclusionsAntibrucella antibodies are prevalent in cattle (3.40%), among abattoir personnel (5.60%) and in pregnant women (0.28%) in Ngaoundere, Cameroon. The study reports the first evidence of human brucellosis in Cameroon and therefore, an indication of a real public health problem. Public awareness campaigns and health education especially among livestock professional and in agropastoral communities should be highlighted to disseminate knowledge, associated risk factors and control measures of brucellosis.

AB BackgroundHepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the most serious public health issues. Recent HBV genetic research has revealed novel genetic rearrangements termed complex structural variations (SVs), which are composed of combinations of SVs such as insertions, deletions, and duplications. An extensive search was made for complex SVs of HBV and their characteristics were analyzed.ResultsFifty-five HBV strains with complex SVs were identified by analyzing genetic sequences of HBV with bioinformatical tools. Along with 15 HBV strains with complex SVs in a previous report, a total of 70 HBV strains harboring complex SVs were analyzed. Complex SVs in the HBV genome were located frequently between nt 1500 and 2000. Insertions were observed in 65/70 (92.9%) of HBV strains with complex SVs. As insertional motif sequences, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 binding site, a sequence complementary to part of box in enhancer II, and insertions of unknown origins were observed. The complex SVs were classified into six groups, and combination of insertion and deletion was observed more frequently than other patterns.ConclusionThrough an extensive search of HBV sequences, new strains with complex SVs were identified in this study. Characteristics of HBV with complex SVs were clarified by the analysis of 70 HBV strains harboring complex SVs. Further investigation is required to elucidate its role in pathogenesis of HBV-related liver disease.

AB BackgroundThe aim of this study was to assess trends and inequalities in dental care utilization in Estonia and Lithuania in relation to large-scale macroeconomic changes in 2004-2012.MethodsData on 22,784 individuals in the 20-64 age group were retrieved from nationally representative cross-sectional surveys in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2012. Age- and sex-standardized prevalence estimates of past 12-month dental visits were calculated for each study year, stratified by gender, age group, ethnicity, educational level and economic activity. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the independent effect of study year and socioeconomic status on dental visits.ResultsThe age- and sex-standardized prevalence of dental visits in the past 12months was 46-52% in Estonia and 61-67% in Lithuania. In 2004-2008, the prevalence of dental visits increased by 5.9 percentage points in both countries and fell in 2008-2010 by 3.8 percentage points in Estonia and 4.6 percentage points in Lithuania. In both countries the prevalence of dental care utilization had increased slightly by 2012, although the increase was statistically insignificant. Results from a logistic regression analysis showed that these differences between study years were not explained by differences in socioeconomic status or oral health conditions. Women, the main ethnic group (only in Estonia), and higher educated and employed persons had significantly higher odds of dental visits in both countries, but the odds were lower for 50-64year olds in Lithuania.ConclusionsIn European Union countries with lower national wealth, the use of dental services is sensitive to macroeconomic changes regardless of the extent of public coverage, at the same time, higher public coverage may not relate to lower inequalities in dental care use.

AB BackgroundAlthough the overall rate of caesarean deliveries in India remains low, rates are higher in private than in public facilities. In a household survey in Delhi, for instance, more than half of women delivering in private facilities reported a caesarean section. Evidence suggests that not all caesarean sections are clinically necessary and may even increase morbidity. We present providers' perspectives of the reasons behind the high rates of caesarean births in private facilities, and possible solutions to counter the trend.MethodsFourteen in-depth interviews were conducted with high-end private sector obstetricians and other allied providers in Delhi and its neighbouring cities, Gurgaon and Ghaziabad.ResultsRespondents were of the common view that private sector caesarean rates were unreasonably high and perceived time and doctors' convenience as the foremost reasons. Financial incentives had an indirect effect on decision-making. Obstetricians felt that they must maintain high patient loads to be commercially successful. Many alluded to their busy working lives, which made it challenging for them to monitor every delivery individually. Besides fearing for patient safety in these situations, they were fearful of legal action if anything went wrong. A lack of context specific guidelines and inadequate support from junior staff and nurses exacerbated these problems. Maternal demand also played a role, as the consumer-provider relationship in private healthcare incentivised obstetricians to fulfil patient demands for caesarean section. Suggested solutions included more support, from either well-trained midwives and junior staff or using a shared practice' model; guidelines introduced by an Indian body; increased regulation within the sector and public disclosure of providers' caesarean rates.ConclusionsCommercial interests contribute indirectly to high caesarean rates, as solo obstetricians juggle the need to maintain high patient loads with inadequate support staff. Perceptions amongst providers and consumers of caesarean section as the safe' option have re-defined caesareans as the new normal', even for low-risk deliveries. At the policy level, guidelines and public disclosures, strong initiatives to develop professional midwifery, and increasing public awareness, could bring about a sustainable reduction in the present high rates.

AB BackgroundIntimate partner violence (IPV) among pregnant women constitutes a global public health problem and a potential risk factor for adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. The present study aimed to examine the associations among IPV during pregnancy, prenatal depression, and adverse birth outcomes in Wuhan, China.MethodsA cross-sectional study was performed from April 2013 to March 2014 in Wuhan, China. Sociodemographic characteristics, IPV during pregnancy, and depressive symptoms during pregnancy were assessed in the third trimester of pregnancy. Birth outcomes were collected after delivery using medical records. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analysis were used to examine the association between IPV and prenatal depression, as well as the association between IPV combined with prenatal depression and adverse birth outcomes.ResultsAfter adjustment for covariates, there was a statistically significant association between IPV during pregnancy and prenatal depression (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=2.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.60-3.90). IPV during pregnancy (aOR=1.67, 95% CI: 1.08-2.56) and prenatal depression (aOR=1.72, 95% CI: 1.11-2.68) were significantly associated with adverse birth outcomes. Women experiencing psychological abuse had a significantly higher odds of prenatal depression (aOR=2.04, 95% CI: 1.19-3.49) and of adverse birth outcomes (aOR=2.13, 95% CI: 1.08-2.58), compared with women who did not experience IPV and prenatal depression.ConclusionsIPV during pregnancy and prenatal depression were significantly associated with adverse birth outcomes, after adjustment for socio-demographic and behavior factors. The findings suggest that early recognition of IPV and prenatal depression during antenatal care may protect pregnant women and improve birth outcomes.

AB BackgroundMortality statistics derived from cause of death data are an important source of information for population health monitoring, priority setting and planning. In Peru, almost all death certificates are issued by doctors because it is a legal requirement. However, the quality of cause of death data is poor. In August 2016, the Ministry of Health of Peru decided to make two specific interventions to improve cause of death data: to introduce an online death certification system and to train doctors in standard death certification practices.MethodsThe study comprised a random sample of 300 pre-intervention death certificates, 900 death certificates that were part of the online intervention, and 900 death certificates that were part of both the online and training interventions. All the deaths had occurred between January and September 2017. We used the Assessing the quality of death certification tool from the University of Melbourne for the assessment. We examined the frequency of common errors in death certificates, the frequency of any error and the average error score for each category of: age group, sex, doctor's seniority, doctor's speciality, level of health facility and broad cause of death.ResultsThe average error score declined by 38% due to the online intervention and by a further 26% due to the training intervention. Improved certification practices remained after controlling for potentially confounding factors. Main improvements were reductions in the absence of a time interval (66% of certificates), incorrect sequence of causes (22%), and ill-defined conditions (13%).ConclusionsThis study demonstrates how the two interventions introduced by the Ministry of Health in Peru improved the correctness of death certificates. The study also provides evidence on necessary changes to the training program to address the poor certification practices that have remained after implementation of the online system.

AB The BRCA Challenge is a long-term data-sharing project initiated within the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) to aggregate BRCA1 and BRCA2 data to support highly collaborative research activities. Its goal is to generate an informed and current understanding of the impact of genetic variation on cancer risk across the iconic cancer predisposition genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2. Initially, reported variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 available from public databases were integrated into a single, newly created site, www.brcaexchange.org. The purpose of the BRCA Exchange is to provide the community with a reliable and easily accessible record of variants interpreted for a high-penetrance phenotype. More than 20,000 variants have been aggregated, three times the number found in the next-largest public database at the project's outset, of which approximately 7,250 have expert classifications. The data set is based on shared information from existing clinical databases-Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC), ClinVar, and the Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD)-as well as population databases, all linked to a single point of access. The BRCA Challenge has brought together the existing international Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles (ENIGMA) consortium expert panel, along with expert clinicians, diagnosticians, researchers, and database providers, all with a common goal of advancing our understanding of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variation. Ongoing work includes direct contact with national centers with access to BRCA1 and BRCA2 diagnostic data to encourage data sharing, development of methods suitable for extraction of genetic variation at the level of individual laboratory reports, and engagement with participant communities to enable a more comprehensive understanding of the clinical significance of genetic variation in BRCA1 and BRCA2.

AB Mycetoma is a neglected tropical disease endemic in tropical and subtropical countries, particularly Sudan. The disease is characterised by the triad of painless subcutaneous mass, multiple sinuses and discharge that contain grains. It is a chronic, debilitating disease most commonly affecting the feet or hands and leads to substantial morbidity, loss of function and even amputation. It predominantly affects poor, rural populations and patients typically present late with advanced disease and complications. In this descriptive cross-sectional study, we characterise the disabling consequences of mycetoma. The study included 300 patients; 228 (76%) male and 72 (24%) female with confirmed mycetoma seen at the Mycetoma Research Centre, University of Khartoum, Sudan in the period May 2016 and January 2017. The study design was based upon the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, examining the impact of mycetoma on eight life domains. Our major finding is that mycetoma is a significantly disabling disease. Over 60% of the study population (181 patients) had moderate impairment or difficulty in at least one domain variable. The important disability was mobility impairment and walking difficulty that was reported in 119 patients (39.7%). There was significant pain associated with mycetoma lesions in 103 patients (34%), challenging the traditional view of mycetoma as a painless disease. The economic burden was also found to be substantial, with 126 patients (46.7%) reporting barriers to their ability to sustain themselves. This is the first study evaluating the disabling consequences of mycetoma and shows clear areas for intervention and further research. Options for mitigating social and economic impacts include routine integration of analgesia and physiotherapy into treatment protocols, and adapting educational provision and working practices based on disability assessment. Our data show that mycetoma is a public health issue with direct implications on quality of life.

TI Visceral leishmaniasis: Spatiotemporal heterogeneity and drivers
   underlying the hotspots in Muzaffarpur, Bihar, India
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID DONOVANI INFECTION; SUBCONTINENT; SPREAD; HEALTH; STATE
AB Background
   Despite the overall decrease in visceral leishmaniasis (VL) incidence on the Indian subcontinent, there remain spatiotemporal clusters or 'hotspots' of new cases. The characteristics of these hotspots, underlying transmission dynamics, and their importance for shaping control strategies are not yet fully understood and are investigated in this study for a VL endemic area of similar to 100,000 inhabitants in Bihar, India between 2007-2015.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   VL incidence (cases/10,000/year) dropped from 12.3 in 2007 to 0.9 in 2015, which is just below the World Health Organizations' threshold for elimination as a public health problem. Clustering of VL was assessed between subvillages (hamlets), using multiple geospatial and (spatio)temporal autocorrelation and hotspot analyses. One to three hotspots were identified each year, often persisting for 1-5 successive years with a modal radius of similar to 500m. The relative risk of having VL was 5-86 times higher for inhabitants of hotspots, compared to those living outside hotspots. Hotspots harbour significantly more households from the two lowest asset quintiles (as proxy for socio-economic status). Overall, children and young adelescents (5-14 years) have the highest risk for VL, but within hotspots and at the start of outbreaks, older age groups (35+ years) show a comparable high risk.
   Conclusions/Significance
   This study demonstrates significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity in VL incidence at subdistrict level. The association between poverty and hotspots confirms that VL is a disease of 'the poorest of the poor' and age patterns suggest a potential role of waning immunity as underlying driver of hotspots. The recommended insecticide spraying radius of 500m around detected VL cases corresponds to the modal hotspot radius found in this study. Additional data on immunity and asymptomatic infection, and the development of spatiotemporally explicit transmission models that simulate hotspot dynamics and predict the impact of interventions at the smaller geographical scale will be crucial tools in sustaining elimination.

DT Article
ID GUINEA WORM; TRICHIASIS
AB Trachoma and Guinea Worm Disease (GWD) are neglected tropical diseases (NTD) slated for elimination as a public health problem and eradication respectively by the World Health Organization. As these programs wind down, uncovering the last cases becomes an urgent priority. In 2010, Ghana Health Services, along with The Carter Center, Sightsavers, and other partners, conducted integrated case searches for both GWD and the last stage of trachoma disease, trachomatous trichiasis (TT), as well as providing surgical treatment for TT to meet elimination (and eradication targets). House to house case searches for both diseases were conducted and two case management strategies were explored: a centralized referral to services method and a Point of Care (POC) delivery method. 835 suspected TT cases were discovered in the centralized method, of which 554 accepted surgery. 482 suspected TT cases were discovered in the POC method and all TT cases accepted surgery. The cost per TT case examined was lower in the POC searches compared to the centralized searches ($19.97 in the POC searches and $20.85 in the centralized searches). Both strategies resulted in high surgical uptake for TT surgery, with average uptakes of 72.4% and 83.9% for the centralized and POC searches respectively. We present here that house to house case searches offering services at POC are feasible and a potential tool for elimination and eradication programs nearing their end.

TI Monitoring the elimination of human African trypanosomiasis: Update to
   2016
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a neglected tropical disease targeted for elimination 'as a public health problem' by 2020. The indicators to monitor progress towards the target are based on the number of reported cases, the related areas and populations exposed at various levels of risk, and the coverage of surveillance activities. Based on data provided by the National Sleeping Sickness Control Programmes (NSSCP), Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and research institutions and assembled in the Atlas of HAT the World Health Organization (WHO) provides here an update to 2016 for these indicators, as well as an analysis of the epidemiological situation.
   Results
   Trends for the two primary indicators of elimination are on track for the 2020 goal: 2,164 cases of HAT were reported in 2016 (as compared to the milestone of 4,000 cases), and for the period 201 2-2016 280,000 km(2) are estimated to be at moderate risk or higher (i.e. >= 1 case/10,000 people/year), as compared to the milestone of 230,000 km(2). These figures correspond to reductions of 92% and 61% as compared to the respective baselines (i.e. 26,550 HAT cases in the year 2000, and 709,000 km2 exposed at various levels of risk for the period 2000-2004). Among the secondary indicators, an overall improvement in the coverage of at risk populations by surveillance activities was observed. Regarding passive surveillance, the number of fixed health facilities providing gambiense HAT diagnosis or treatment expanded, with 1,338 enumerated in endemic countries in 2017 (+52% as compared to the survey completed only sixteen months earlier). Concerning rhodesiense HAT, 124 health facilities currently provide diagnosis or treatment. The broadening of passive surveillance is occurring in a context of fairly stable intensity of active case finding, with between 1.8 million and 2.4 million people screened per year over the period 2012-2016.
   Discussion
   Elimination of HAT as a public health problem by 2020 seems within reach, as the epidemiological trends observed in previous years are confirmed in this latest 2016 monitoring update. However, looking beyond 2020, and in particular to the 2030 goal of elimination of transmission as zero cases for the gambiense form of the disease only, there is no room for complacency. Challenges still abound, including ensuring the effective integration of HAT control activities in the health system, sustaining the commitment of donors and HAT endemic countries, and clarifying the extent of the threat posed by cryptic reservoirs (e.g. human asymptomatic carriers and the possible animal reservoirs in gambiense HAT epidemiology). WHO provides through the network for HAT elimination the essential coordination of the wide range of stakeholders to ensure synergy of efforts.

TI Sounding the alarm: Defining thresholds to trigger a public health
   response to monkeypox
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID SURVEILLANCE DATA; ABERRATIONS; EPIDEMICS; DISEASE; SYSTEM; CONGO
AB Endemic to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), monkeypox is a zoonotic disease that causes smallpox-like illness in humans. Observed fluctuations in reported cases over time raises questions about when it is appropriate to mount a public health response, and what specific actions should be taken. We evaluated three different thresholds to differentiate between baseline and heightened disease incidence, and propose a novel, tiered algorithm for public health action. Monkeypox surveillance data from Tshuapa Province, 20112013, were used to calculate three different statistical thresholds: Cullen, c-sum, and a World Health Organization (WHO) method based on monthly incidence. When the observed cases exceeded the threshold for a given month, that month was considered to be 'aberrant'. For each approach, the number of aberrant months detected was summed by year-each method produced vastly different results. The Cullen approach generated a number of aberrant signals over the period of consideration (9/36 months). The c-sum method was the most sensitive (30/36 months), followed by the WHO method (12/24 months). We conclude that triggering public health action based on signals detected by a single method may be inefficient and overly simplistic for monkeypox. We propose instead a response algorithm that integrates an objective threshold (WHO method) with contextual information about epidemiological and spatiotemporal links between suspected cases to determine whether a response should be operating under i) routine surveillance ii) alert status, or iii) outbreak status. This framework could be modified and adopted by national and zone level health workers in monkeypox-endemic countries. Lastly, we discuss considerations for selecting thresholds for monkeypox outbreaks across gradients of endemicity and public health resources.

SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID CONTACTS; REGRESSION
AB Background
   Morocco has achieved the goal of leprosy elimination as a public health problem several years ago (less than 1 case/10 000 habitant). The aim of this study was to analyze trends of leprosy detection during the last 17 years taking into consideration the implementation of single dose rifampicin chemoprophylaxis (SDRC) started in 2012.
   Methodology
   Time series of leprosy cases detected at national level between 2000 and 2017. Variable collected for each year were leprosy per 100000 H, age category, gender, origin, regions, grade of disabilities and clinical forms. The detection time series was assessed by Joinpoint Regression Analysis. Annual percentage changes (APCs) were estimated to identify the years (joinpoint) when significant changes occurred in the trend. We therefore examined trends in leprosy detection according to epidemiological variables.
   Findings
   Joinpoint regression showed a reduction in the detection rate between 2000 and 2017. The APC for the period 2012-2017 (-16.83, 95% CI: -29.2 to -2.3, p < 0.05) was more pronounced than that of the previous period 2000-2012 (-4.68, 95% CI: -7.3 to -2.0, p < 0.05); with a significant break in the same joinpoint year SDRC implementation. In stratified analysis, case detection decreased, but not significantly, after the joinpoint years in men, children, multi-bacillary cases, grade 0-1 disabilities, rural and urban cases and in ten regions.
   Conclusions
   Leprosy detection was declining over years with a significant reduction by 16% per year from 2012 to 2017. SDRC may reduce leprosy detection over the years following its administration.

TI Exploration of a simplified clinical examination for scabies to support
   public health decision-making
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID POPULATION; PREVALENCE; MANAGEMENT; ALGORITHM; TRACHOMA
AB Introduction
   In most settings, the diagnosis of scabies is reliant on time-consuming and potentially intrusive clinical examination of all accesible regions of skin. With the recent recognition of scabies as a neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organization there is a need for standardised approaches to disease mapping to define populations likely to benefit from intervention, and to measure the impact of interventions. Development and validation of simplified approaches to diagnose scabies would facilitate these efforts.
   Methods
   We utilised data from three population-based surveys of scabies. We classified each individual as having scabies absent or present overall, based on whole body assessment, and in each of 9 regions of the body. We calculated the sensitivity of diagnosing the presence of scabies based on each individual body region compared to the reference standard based on whole body examination and identified combinations of regions which provided greater than 90% sensitivity. We assessed the sensitivity according to gender, age group, severity of scabies and the presence or absence of impetigo.
   Results
   We included 1,373 individuals with scabies. The body regions with highest yield were the hands (sensitivity compared to whole body examination 51.2%), feet (49.7%), and lower legs (48.3%). Examination of the exposed components of both limbs provided a sensitivity of 93.2% (95% CI 91.2-94.4%). The sensitivity of this more limited examination was greater than 90% regardless of scabies severity or the presence or absence of secondary impetigo.
   Discussion
   We found that examination limited to hands, feet and lower legs was close to 90% for detecting scabies compared to a full body examination. A simplified and less intrusive diagnostic process for scabies will allow expansion of mapping and improved decision-making about public health interventions. Further studies in other settings are needed to prospectively validate this simplified approach.

AB Aside from malaria, infectious diseases are an important cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa and continue to pose major public health problems in African countries, notably pneumonia. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common bacterial cause of pneumonia in all age groups. The skin is one of the main infection sites followed by the oropharynx. The skin carriage of certain pathogenic bacteria such as S. pneumoniae is often ignored or under-diagnosed. Finally, the mode of transmission of these infections remains uncertain. Here, we hypothesized that skin could play a role in the transmission of these infections. We collected 649 cotton swabs from a healthy population in Dielmo and Ndiop, rural Senegal. The sampling was carried out on the palm of the hands. After DNA extraction and actin control, qPCR targeting eight different bacteria was performed on 614 skin samples. We detected Streptococcus pneumoniae in 33.06% (203/614), Staphylococcus aureus in 18.08% (111/614) and Streptococcus pyogenes in 1.95% (12/614) of samples. A skin S. pneumoniae carriage was detected in more than a third of a rural population in rural Africa, highlighting the need to develop hand disinfection programs in order to reduce the burden of infections.

DT Review

   MOSQUITO; EFFICACY; PROGRAM; TIGER; AREAS
AB Background
   Diseases caused by Aedes-borne viruses, such as dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever, are emerging and reemerging globally. The causes are multifactorial and include global trade, international travel, urbanisation, water storage practices, lack of resources for intervention, and an inadequate evidence base for the public health impact of Aedes control tools. National authorities need comprehensive evidence-based guidance on how and when to implement Aedes control measures tailored to local entomological and epidemiological conditions.
   Methods and findings
   This review is one of a series being conducted by the Worldwide Insecticide resistance Network (WIN). It describes a framework for implementing Integrated Aedes Management (IAM) to improve control of diseases caused by Aedes-borne viruses based on available evidence. IAM consists of a portfolio of operational actions and priorities for the control of Aedes-borne viruses that are tailored to different epidemiological and entomological risk scenarios. The framework has 4 activity pillars: (i) integrated vector and disease surveillance, (ii) vector control, (iii) community mobilisation, and (iv) intra- and intersectoral collaboration as well as 4 supporting activities: (i) capacity building, (ii) research, (iii) advocacy, and (iv) policies and laws.
   Conclusions
   IAM supports implementation of the World Health Organisation Global Vector Control Response (WHO GVCR) and provides a comprehensive framework for health authorities to devise and deliver sustainable, effective, integrated, community-based, locally adapted vector control strategies in order to reduce the burden of Aedes-transmitted arboviruses. The success of IAM requires strong commitment and leadership from governments to maintain proactive disease prevention programs and preparedness for rapid responses to outbreaks.

AB Background
   Validation of elimination of trachoma as a public health problem is based on clinical indicators, using the WHO simplified grading system. Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) infection and anti-Ctantibody responses (anti-Pgp3) have both been evaluated as alternative indicators in settings with varying levels of trachoma. There is a need to evaluate the feasibility of using tests for Ct infection and anti-Pgp3 antibodies at scale in a trachoma-endemic country and to establish the added value of the data generated for understanding transmission dynamics in the peri-elimination setting.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   Dried blood spots for serological testing and ocular swabs for Ct infection testing (taken from children aged 1-9 years) were integrated into the pre-validation trachoma surveys conducted in the Northern and Upper West regions of Ghana in 2015 and 2016. Ct infection was detected using the GeneXpert PCR platform and the presence of anti-Pgp3 antibodies was detected using both the ELISA assay and multiplex bead array (MBA). The overall mean cluster-summarised TF prevalence (the clinical indicator) was 0.8% (95% CI: 0.6-1.0) and Ct infection prevalence was 0.04% (95`%Cl: 0.00-0.12). Anti-Pgp3 seroprevalence using the ELISA was 5.5% (95% CI: 4.8-6.3) compared to 4.3% (95`)%Cl: 3.7-4.9) using the MBA. There was strong evidence from both assays that seropositivity increased with age (p<0.001), although the seroconversion rate was estimated to be very low (between 1.2 to 1.3 yearly events per 100 children).
   Conclusions/Significance
   Infection and serological data provide useful information to aid in understanding Ct transmission dynamics. Elimination of trachoma as a public health problem does not equate to the absence of ocular Ct infection nor cessation in acquisition of anti-Ct antibodies.

TI Supermarket policies on less-healthy food at checkouts: Natural
   experimental evaluation using interrupted time series analyses of
   purchases
SO PLOS MEDICINE

AB Background
   In response to public concerns and campaigns, some United Kingdom supermarkets have implemented policies to reduce less-healthy food at checkouts. We explored the effects of these policies on purchases of less-healthy foods commonly displayed at checkouts.
   Methods and findings
   We used a natural experimental design and two data sources providing complementary and unique information. We analysed data on purchases of small packages of common, less-healthy, checkout foods (sugary confectionary, chocolate, and potato crisps) from 2013 to 2017 from nine UK supermarkets (Aldi, Asda, Co-op, Lidl, M&S, Morrisons, Sainsbury's, Tesco, and Waitrose). Six supermarkets implemented a checkout food policy between 2013 and 2017 and were considered intervention stores; the remainder were comparators.
   Firstly, we studied the longitudinal association between implementation of checkout policies and purchases taken home. We used data from a large (n approximate to 30,000) household purchase panel of food brought home to conduct controlled interrupted time series analyses of purchases of less-healthy common checkout foods from 12 months before to 12 months after implementation. We conducted separate analyses for each intervention supermarket, using others as comparators. We synthesised results across supermarkets using random effects meta-analyses. Implementation of a checkout food policy was associated with an immediate reduction in four-weekly purchases of common checkout foods of 157,000 (72,700-242,800) packages per percentage market share-equivalent to a 17.3% reduction. This decrease was sustained at 1 year with 185,100 (121,700-248,500) fewer packages purchased per 4 weeks per percentage market share-equivalent to a 15.5% reduction. The immediate, but not sustained, effect was robust to sensitivity analysis.
   Secondly, we studied the cross-sectional association between checkout food policies and purchases eaten without being taken home. We used data from a smaller (n approximate to 7,500) individual purchase panel of food bought and eaten 'on the go'. We conducted cross-sectional analyses comparing purchases of common checkout foods in 2016-2017 from supermarkets with and without checkout food policies. There were 76.4% (95% confidence interval 48.6%-89.1%) fewer annual purchases of less-healthy common checkout foods from supermarkets with versus without checkout food policies.
   The main limitations of the study are that we do not know where in the store purchases were selected and cannot determine the effect of changes in purchases on consumption. Other interventions may also have been responsible for the results seen.
   Conclusions
   There is a potential impact of checkout food polices on purchases. Voluntary supermarketled activities may have public health benefits.

AB BackgroundRed foxes (Vulpes vulpes L.) have become successful inhabitants of urban areas in recent years. However, our knowledge about the occurrence, distribution and association with land uses of these urban foxes is poor, partly because many favoured habitats are on private properties and therefore hardly accessible to scientists. We assumed that citizen science, i.e. the involvement of the public, could enable researchers to bridge this information gap. We analysed 1179 fox sightings in the city of Vienna, Austria reported via citizen science projects to examine relationships between foxes and the surrounding land use classes as well as sociodemographic parameters.ResultsConditional probabilities of encountering foxes were substantially higher in gardens, areas with a low building density, parks or squares as compared to agricultural areas, industrial areas or forests. Generalized linear model analyses showed that sociodemographic parameters such as education levels, district area, population density and average household income additionally improved the predictability of fox sightings.ConclusionsReports of fox sightings by citizen scientists might help to support the establishment of wildlife management in cities. Additionally, these data could be used to address public health issues in relation with red foxes as they can carry zoonoses that are also dangerous to humans.

AB BackgroundStrong management skills are key to improving performance of health systems. Action learning, a technique to develop management skills, has been used successfully with health managers but not usually among lower level managers or in low and middle-income countries (LMICs).MethodsThis study uses a qualitative approach to explore experiences, successes and challenges of using an action learning approach to improve skills of managers in neonatal units in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa. Eight action learning groups were convened with neonatal unit managers from all 39 district hospitals in KZN, each group had 4-6 participants. Meetings were conducted by a facilitator trained in action learning techniques, and groups met a minimum of ten times over a one-year period. After completion of the intervention, 14 in-depth interviews were conducted with purposively selected action learning participants. Data was transcribed and analysed using framework analysis.ResultsNeonatal unit managers found that action learning generated a sense of empowerment in their abilities, trust and confidence among participants was nurtured, problem solving and critical thinking skills were developed, and a continuous support system was created. The action learning process led to several positive changes in neonatal units, which enhanced the quality of care for patients. A number of challenges were also identified, mainly relating to administrative issues such as the provision of a skilled facilitator, permission to attend action learning meetings and logistical issues, including transport and other financial implications.ConclusionsThis paper illustrates that action learning can be an effective and practical method to support public health workers to manage their health units despite the challenges associated with the method. Time, energy and financial resources used to facilitate action learning for this cadre of health workers is rewarded by improved skills of managers and better quality of care for patients.

AB BackgroundThe perfect' journey through an Irish Methadone Maintenance Treatment Programme (MMTP) would have a client engage appropriately with all relevant services available to them, inclusive of psychiatry, counselling, out-reach support, nursing and psychology. Concurrently, a client would ideally adhere to their prescribed methadone-dosing regimen, until a client is stabilised allowing them to function optimally. At this point, a client should transfer to the GP community setting. Unfortunately, this fails to occur. To date, very few studies have specifically investigated the reasons why a cohort of clients remain trapped' in the high risk, specialist clinical setting.MethodsQualitative detailed semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 17 clients of one of Ireland's Health Service Executive (HSE) Drug and Alcohol Services, entitled HSE Mid-West Limerick Drug and Alcohol Service'. Each client had a severe Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) and clients had spent on average 7.5years engaging with the MMTP.ResultsParticipants' life journey prior to an OUD included Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and early exposure to illicit drug use. Shared life events resulting in their initiating and sustaining an OUD involved continuous hardship into adulthood, mental illness and concurrent benzodiazepine use disorder, often resulting in harrowing accounts of participants' loneliness and lack of life purpose. Their living environments, an erroneous understanding of their illness and poor communication with allied health professionals further perpetuated their OUD. Positive factors influencing periods of abstinence were familial incentives and a belief in the efficacy of methadone. Clients own suggestions for improving their journeys included employing a multi-sectorial approach to managing OUD and educating themselves and others on opioid agonist treatments. If clients were not progressing appropriately, they themselves suggested enforcing a time-limit' on clients to engage with the programme or indeed for their treatment to be postponed.ConclusionsTo optimise the functioning of the MMTP, three tasks need to be fulfilled: 1) Reduce the incidences of ACEs, 2) Diagnose and treat clients with a dual diagnosis 3) Educate clients, their families, the public and allied health care professionals on all aspects of OUD. A cross- departmental, inter-governmental approach is needed to address opioid misuse as a societal issue as a whole.

AB BackgroundDeclining participation rates are impeding health research. Little is known about factors influencing the decision to participate in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Therefore, this paper reports on the various individual factors and their with contextual factors in influencing participation in research among pregnant women and the recommendations to enhance their recruitment in Lebanon.MethodsThis study used a qualitative research design drawing on focus groups and in-depth interviews. The Theoretical Domain Framework guided data collection and analysis. The three participant groups included: Group 1-Pregnant women (n=25) attending public pre-natal events and antenatal clinics in Beirut; Group 2-Pregnant women (n=6) already enrolled in the ongoing Mother and Infant Nutritional Assessment birth cohort study; Group 3-Key informants (n=13) including health care workers involved in recruiting pregnant women. Conversations were audio recorded, transcribed, translated into English, and thematically analyzed.ResultsThree main factors influencing participation were revealed, with each factor encompassing several sub-themes: (1) personal factors (altruism, self-confidence, personal interest in the topic, previous understanding of the nature and purpose of research, education level, and previous research experience), (2) contextual factors (societal factors, family and friends), and (3) study characteristics (burden of the study, ethical considerations, incentives, and research interpersonal skills and physician endorsement to participate). The results suggested a dynamic interaction among the identified factors, forming two intersecting axes, with a four-quadrant configuration. The y- and x-axes represented personal factors and contextual factors, respectively. Individuals positioned on the lower-left quadrant were the least likely to participate; those on the upper-right quadrant were the most likely to participate; while those on the upper-left and lower-right quadrants were indecisive. Study characteristics seemed to affect the decision of pregnant women to participate situated in any of the four quadrants. Specific recommendations to improve participation were also identified.ConclusionsOur findings suggested an interaction of personal factors, contextual factors, and study characteristics affecting subjects' participation. This interaction integrates factors into a novel dynamic framework that could be used in future studies. The recommendations identified may help improve participation of pregnant women in health research hence enhancing the quality and generalizability of research findings in LMIC.

AB BackgroundIn developing countries, child health outcomes are influenced by the non-availability of priority life-saving medicines at public sector health facilities and non-affordability of medicines at private medicine outlets. This study aimed to assess availability, price components and affordability of priority life-saving medicines for under-five children in Tigray region, Northern Ethiopia.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted in Tigray region from December 2015 to July 2016 using a standard method developed by the World Health Organization and Health Action International (WHO/HAI). Data on the availability and price of 27 priority life-saving medicines were collected from 31 public and 10 private sectors. Availability and prices were expressed in percent and median price ratios (MPRs), respectively. Affordability was reported in terms of the daily wage of the lowest-paid unskilled government worker.ResultsThe overall availability of priority life-saving drugs in this study was low (34.1%). The average availabilities of all surveyed medicines in public and private sectors were 41.9 and 31.5%, respectively. The overall availability of medicines for malaria was found to be poor with average values of 29.3% for artemisinin combination therapy tablet, 19.5% for artesunate injection and 0% for rectal artesunate. Whereas, the availability of oral rehydration salt (ORS) and zinc sulphate dispersible tablets for the treatment of diarrhea was moderately high (90% for ORS and 82% for zinc sulphate). Medicines for pneumonia showed an overall percent availability in the range of 0% (ampicillin 250mg and 1g powder for injection and oxygen medicinal gas) to 100% (amoxicillin 500mg capsule). The MPRs of 12 lowest price generic medicines were 1.5 and 2.7 times higher than the international reference prices (IRPs) for the private and public sectors, respectively. About 30% of priority life-saving medicines in the public sector and 50% of them in the private sector demanded above a single daily wages to purchase the standard treatment of the prevalent diseases of children.ConclusionsThe lower availability, high price and low affordability of lowest price generic priority life-saving medicines in public and private sectors reflect a failure to implement the health policy on priority life-saving medicines in the region.

AB BackgroundHypertension and prehypertension pose significant public-health and clinical challenges for both economically developed and developing nations. Prevalence of these conditions are frequently underreported because of its often-silent nature. Population-based studies that explore the occurrence and correlates of these conditions are scarce in Saudi Arabia. This study aimed at estimating the prevalence and associated factors of hypertension and prehypertension on a representative sample of males and females living in Al-Kharj town in Saudi Arabia.MethodsCross-sectional analysis was performed from January 2016 until June 2016 by recruiting a representative sample (n=1019; aged 18 to 67years) of the Al Kharj population. All participants completed a self-administered questionnaire, followed by a physical examination and blood test. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS version 24.0 for Windows.ResultsThe prevalence of prehypertension was 66.1, 48.1 and 54.9% in male, female and all subjects, respectively. The prevalence of hypertension was 6.0, 4.2 and 4.9% in male, female and all subjects, respectively. Being overweight was associated with the highest risk of hypertension (OR=4.98 [95% C.I. = 1.98-12.52], P=0.001). People who were classified as class I obese had 3.5 times the risk of hypertension compared with the non-obese group (OR=3.49 [95% C.I. = 1.42-8.63], P=0.007). Risk of pre-hypertension was significantly lower in females (OR=0.48 [95% C.I.=0.32-0.71]) and tends to increase with obesity status. Gender-specific analyses found that males in the lowest education attainment level had a significantly increased risk of pre-hypertension (OR=6.56 [95% C.I. = 1.27-33.85], P=0.003).ConclusionThis population-based study in Saudi Arabia shows that hypertension and prehypertension are common conditions particularly among males. Overweight and obesity was associated with both conditions. In addition, lower education attainment was asignificantly associated factor among males. Future prospective studies are needed to confirm the etiological nature of such associations.

AB BackgroundPublic bicycle share programs in many cities are used by a small segment of the population. To better understand the market for public bicycle share, this study examined the socio-demographic and transportation characteristics of current, potential, and unlikely users of a public bicycle share program and identified specific motivators and deterrents to public bicycle share use.MethodsWe used cross-sectional data from a 2017 Vancouver public bicycle share (Mobi by Shaw Go) member survey (n=1272) and a 2017 population-based survey of Vancouver residents (n=792). We categorized non-users from the population survey as either potential or unlikely users based on their stated interest in using public bicycle share within the next year. We used descriptive statistics to compare the demographic and transportation characteristics of current users to non-users, and multiple logistic regression to compare the profiles of potential and unlikely users.ResultsPublic bicycle share users in Vancouver tended to be male, employed, and have higher educations and incomes as compared to non-users, and were more likely to use active modes of transportation. The vast majority of non-users (74%) thought the public bicycle share program was a good idea for Vancouver. Of the non-users, 23% were identified as potential users. Potential users tended to be younger, have lower incomes, and were more likely to use public transit for their main mode of transportation, as compared to current and unlikely users. The most common motivators among potential users related to health benefits, not owning a bicycle, and stations near their home or destination. The deterrents among unlikely users were a preference for riding their own bicycle, perceived inconvenience compared to other modes, bad weather, and traffic. Cost was a deterrent to one-fifth of unlikely users, notable given they tended to have lower incomes than current users.ConclusionFindings can help inform targeted marketing and outreach to increase public bicycle share uptake in the population.

AB Background
   Utilization of maternal health care services is key to reducing the number of perinatal deaths and post-natal complications in sub-Saharan Africa. With a few exceptions, many studies that examine the use of maternal health services in sub-Saharan Africa have focused largely on individual-level explanations and have ignored the importance of contextual and community-level explanations. In Ghana, progress has been made in reducing maternal mortality ratio from 740/100,000 in the late 1990s to 319/100,000 in 2015 but these rates are still high. Our study focuses on impact of individual and community level-factors on maternal outcomes with the hope that it will inform public policy in Ghana. This approach highlights latent or unacknowledged aspects of fragility within health systems designed to improve maternal health and opportunities for improving uptake of services.
   Methods and findings
   Using the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, we examined the effects of individual and community-level factors on antenatal care, facility-based delivery, and post-natal care. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to examine the effects of individual and community-level factors on the outcome variables. Our analysis revealed that overall utilization of antenatal, facility-based delivery and post-natal care was substantial across the board; however, both individual and community-level factors were significant predictors of these maternal health outcomes. Wealthier and better educated women were more likely to use antenatal services and facility-based delivery; in contrast poor and uneducated women were more likely to use antenatal and postnatal care but not facility-based delivery. Additionally, use of National Health Insurance Scheme was statistically associated with the utilization of maternal health services.
   Conclusions
   The findings point to areas where services can be better tailored to meet community-specific needs. Policy makers must consider factors such as educational levels and economic security at both individual and community-levels that shape women's preferences and uptake of maternal health care in Ghana.

AB Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has caused several major epidemics globally over the last two decades and is quickly expanding into new areas. Although this mosquito-borne disease is self-limiting and is not associated with high mortality, it can lead to severe, chronic and disabling arthritis, thereby posing a heavy burden to healthcare systems. The two main vectors for CHIKV are Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus (Asian tiger mosquito); however, many other mosquito species have been described as competent CHIKV vectors in scientific literature. With climate change, globalization and unfettered urban planning affecting many areas, CHIKV poses a significant public health risk to many countries. A scoping review was conducted to collate and categorize all pertinent information gleaned from published scientific literature on a priori defined aspects of CHIKV and its competent vectors. After developing a sensitive and specific search algorithm for the research question, seven databases were searched and data was extracted from 1920 relevant articles. Results show that CHIKV research is reported predominantly in areas after major epidemics have occurred. There has been an upsurge in CHIKV publications since 2011, especially after first reports of CHIKV emergence in the Americas. A list of hosts and vectors that could potentially be involved in the sylvatic and urban transmission cycles of CHIKV has been compiled in this scoping review. In addition, a repository of CHIKV mutations associated with evolutionary fitness and adaptation has been created by compiling and characterizing these genetic variants as reported in scientific literature.

AB Typhoid fever is estimated to cause between 9.9-24.2 million cases and 75,000-208,000 deaths per year globally. Low-income and middle-income countries report the majority of cases, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa. The epidemiology of typhoid fever is poorly understood, particularly in Ghana where there has been no study of the within-country variation. Our objective was to explore and analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of typhoid fever morbidities in Ghana. We used the global and local Moran's indices to uncover the existence of global and local spatial patterns, respectively. Generalized linear autoregressive moving average (glarma) models were developed to explore the overall and regional level temporal patterns of morbidities. The overall index of spatial association was 0.19 (p < 0.001). The global Moran's monthly indices of clustering ranged from approximate to 0 - 0.28, with few non-significant (p > 0.05) estimates. The yearly estimates were all significant (p < 0.001) and ranged from 0.1-0.19, suggesting spatial clustering of typhoid. The local Moran's maps indicated isolated high contributions of clustering within the Upper West and Western regions. The overall and regional level glarma models indicated significant first and second-order serial correlation as well as quarterly trends. These findings can provide relevant epidemiological insight into the spatial and temporal patterns of typhoid epidemiology and useful to complement the development of control strategies by public health managers.

TI Quality of medicines in southern Togo: Investigation of antibiotics and

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID DRUGS; TABLES
AB Substandard and falsified medicines represent a serious threat for public health and patient safety. Especially in low and middle-income countries, the prevalence of substandard and falsified medicines is reportedly high. However, reliable information on the prevalence of poor-quality medicines is scarce. In this study, 12 essential medicines, including antibiotics, antidiabetics, cardiac drugs and antiasthmatic drugs, were collected from six informal vendors and six licensed pharmacies in the southern part of Togo (regions Maritime and Plateaux). A mystery shopper approach was used in both types of outlets. In total, 64 samples were collected from licensed pharmacies and 30 from informal vendors. Both availability of medicines and prices of medicines were higher in licensed pharmacies than in informal vendors. 92 medicine samples were analyzed by visual examination, followed by chemical analysis for the content and for the dissolution of the active pharmaceutical ingredients according to the respective monographs of the United States Pharmacopoeia. 7 samples (8%) did not comply with the pharmacopoeial specifications, and one sample (1%) showed even extreme deviations. None of the samples was obviously falsified. However, one sample of amoxicillin capsules contained only 47% of the declared content of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, indicating that it may represent amoxicillin capsules 250 mg, rather than 500mg as declared on the label. Medicines stated to originate from Asia (i.e. mainly from India and China) showed a significantly higher proportion (24%) of non-compliant samples than those from Africa and Europe (4%, p = 0.007). High failure rates were observed in medicines both from informal vendors (13%) and from licensed pharmacies (5%), but the difference between both groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.152). The observed high prevalence of substandard medicines requires action from regulatory authorities and health care providers. Testing of selected samples for related substances indicated that inappropriate transport and storage conditions may have been an important cause for substandard quality.

AB Objective
   The recent 2014 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreaks rang the bell to call upon global efforts to assist resource-constrained countries to strengthen public health surveillance system for early response. Malawi adopted the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy to develop its national surveillance system since 2002 and revised its guideline to fulfill the International Health Regulation (IHR) requirements in 2014. This study aimed to understand the state of IDSR implementation and differences between guideline and practice for future disease surveillance system strengthening.
   Methods
   This was a mixed-method research study. Quantitative data were to analyze completeness and timeliness of surveillance system performance from national District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2) during October 2014 to September 2016. Qualitative data were collected through interviews with 29 frontline health service providers from the selected district and 7 key informants of the IDSR system implementation and administration at district and national levels.
   Findings
   The current IDSR system showed relatively good completeness (73.1%) but poor timeliness (40.2%) of total expected monthly reports nationwide and zero weekly reports during the study period. Major implementation gaps were lack of weekly report and trainings. The challenges of IDSR implementation revealed through qualitative data included case identification, compiling reports for timely submission and inadequate resources.
   Conclusions
   The differences between IDSR technical guideline and actual practice were huge. The developing information technology infrastructure in Malawi and emerging mobile health mHealth) technology can be opportunities for the country to overcome these challenges and improve surveillance system to have better timeliness for the outbreaks and unusual events detection.

AB Background: Antenatal depression is more prevalent in low and middle income countries as compared to high income countries. It has now been documented as a global public health problem owing to its severity, chronic nature and recurrence as well as its negative influence on the general health of women and development of children. However, in Ethiopia, there are few studies with highly variable and inconsistent findings. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of antenatal depression and its determinants among pregnant women in Ethiopia.
   Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we exhaustively searched several databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct and Cochrane Library. To estimate the pooled prevalence, studies reporting the prevalence of antenatal depression and its determinants were included. Data were extracted using a standardized data extraction format prepared in Microsoft Excel and transferred to STATA 14 statistical software for analysis. To assess heterogeneity, the Cochrane Q test statistics and I-2 test were used. Since the included studies exhibit considerable heterogeneity, a random effect meta- analysis model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of antenatal depression. Finally, the association between determinant factors and antenatal depression were assessed.
   Results: The overall pooled prevalence of antenatal depression, in Ethiopia, was 24.2% (95% CI: 19.8, 28.6). The subgroup analysis of this study indicated that the highest prevalence was reported from Addis Ababa region with a prevalence of 26.9% (21.9-32.1) whereas the lowest prevalence was reported from Amhara region, 17.25 (95% CI: 6.34, 28.17). Presence of previous history of abortion (OR: 3.0, 95% CI: 2.1, 4.4), presence of marital conflict (OR: 7.2; 95% CI: 2.7, 19.0), lack of social support from husband (OR: 3.2: 95% CI: 1.2, 8.9), and previous history of pregnancy complication (OR: 3.2: 95% CI: 1.8, 5.8) were found to be determinants of antenatal depression.
   Conclusion: The pooled prevalence of antenatal depression, in Ethiopia, was relatively high. Presence of previous history of abortion, presence of marital conflict, lack of social support from husband, presence of previous history of pregnancy complications were the main determinants of antenatal depression in Ethiopia.

AB Background: Psychological disturbances are prevalent in people with burn injuries; however, psychological services are rarely accessiblepost-burn injury in China. The objective of this qualitative study was to explore and conceptualize the obstacles to delivering mental health care in burn injury patients.
   Methods: The researchers used a grounded theory research approach to interview sixteen burn injury patients, five nurses, four rehabilitation therapists, five medical doctors, and eight caregivers regarding their experiences with current health care services and barriers.
   Results: An explorative model was generated from the data, and the relationships among the categories were identified. People's beliefs, knowledge, socioeconomic status, cultural understanding of mental health, and social stigma appear to play key roles in the public health approach to post-burn health promotion and post-burn psychosocial interventions.
   Conclusion: The model proposed in our research highlights the need to focus on the underlying social, economic, and cultural determinants of mental health care. The underlying social determinants of the mental health care gap that is responsible for the ill-prepared health care must be addressed.

   Pharmaceutical policy; Consumer health information
ID PHARMACEUTICAL-INDUSTRY; PRESCRIPTION; COVERAGE; NEWS
AB Background: European legislation prohibits direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines, but allows drug manufacturers to provide information to the public on health and diseases. Our aim was to measure the frequency of disease awareness campaigns in Latvian media and assess their compliance with international and European standards.
   Methods: Materials on health/disease and treatments were collected between April and September 2015 from 12 newspapers and magazines and six online portals. Disease awareness campaigns were assessed using a previously developed instrument based on the WHO Ethical Criteria for Medicinal Drug promotion and European standards (EU law and pharmaceutical industry self-regulatory guidelines). Collected materials were used to examine the information provided on medical conditions and their diagnosis and treatment. The inter-rater reliability was calculated.
   Results: We collected 263 materials from print (n=149) and online media (n=114); 94 were news items and 169 were disease-awareness advertisements. Cancer, cardiovascular problems, allergies and respiratory diseases were common topics. Of the 157 campaigns assessed, non-compliance was identified in 149 cases (inter-rater reliability 90%), mainly due to misleading or incomplete information, lack of balance and the absence of a listed author/sponsor. Six disease awareness campaigns directly mentioned a pharmaceutical product by brand name and other four included the logo or name of a manufacturer, referred to a condition and indirectly mentioned a treatment, all in contravention with European law.
   Conclusions:The compliance of disease awareness campaigns in Latvian media with international and European standards is low. This raises concerns about the nature of information being conveyed. Through lack of balance, missing sponsorship information, and misleading or incomplete information, these campaigns could contribute to inaccurate self-diagnosis and generate demand among those who might not need medical treatment.

TI Opening windows and closing gaps: a case analysis of Canada's 2009
   tobacco additives ban and its policy lessons
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID MULTIPLE-STREAMS APPROACH; FRAMEWORK CONVENTION; POLITICS; COUNTRIES;
   SUPPORT; HISTORY
AB Background: In 2009, Canada adopted legislation (Bill C-32) restricting the sale of flavoured tobacco products, one of the first in the world. This study examines the agenda-setting process leading to the adoption of Bill C-32.
   Methods: This research was conducted using a case study design informed by Kingdon's Multiple Streams framework and Heclo's policy learning approach. In-depth interviews were conducted with key informants from government, health-based non-governmental organizations (NGOs), trade associations and the cigar manufacturing sector (n=11). Public documents produced by media (n=19), government (n=11), NGOs (n=15), as well as technical reports (n=8) and formal stakeholder submissions (n=137) were included for analysis. Data were coded with the objective of understanding key events or moments in the lead up to the adoption of Bill C-32 and the actors and arguments in support of and opposition to Bill C-32.
   Results: The findings point to the importance of a small but active group of NGOs who worked to publicize the issue and eventually take advantage of an open policy window. Our analysis also illustrates that even though consensus was developed about the policy problem and civil society was able to garner political support to address the problem, disagreement and dissent pertaining to the technical dimensions of the policy solution created loopholes for the tobacco industry to exploit.
   Conclusions: NGOs remain a critical factor in efforts to strengthen tobacco control policy. These organizations were able to mobilize support for the tobacco flavouring ban adopted at the Federal level in Canada, and although the initial Bill had major limitations to achieving the health objectives, the persistence of these NGOs resulted in amendments to close these loopholes.

TI Health-seeking pathway and factors leading to delays in tuberculosis
   diagnosis in West Pokot County, Kenya: A grounded theory study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; SERVICE DELAY; CARE-SEEKING; PATIENT; TB;
   SUSPECTS; DISTRICT; ETHIOPIA
AB Background
   Patients' health-seeking behaviour can lead to delays in tuberculosis ( TB) diagnosis, however little is known about the experiences and treatment pathways of patients diagnosed with TB in Kenya. The aim of this study is to explore the health seeking practices and factors contributing to delay in TB diagnosis.
   Methods
   This study was based on explorative qualitative research using a constructivist grounded theory approach. A total of 61 TB patients in the intensive phase of treatment were recruited as informants in the study. Six focus group discussions and 15 in-depth interviews were used to collect data. Data were analysed through three step coding using the grounded theory approach.
   Results
   Participants adopted different treatment pathways as they sought care from a pluralistic health care system involving traditional healers, herbalists, private clinic, drug shops and the public health sector. The study revealed an explanatory model of factors leading to delay illustrated by the participant's expression "I suffered for a long time." The model is comprised of three categories that lead to delays, namely individual, social-cultural and structural factors.
   Conclusion
   There is a need to improve timely diagnosis of TB through innovative approaches such as intensive case finding. Similarly, the health-care system should decentralize TB services as much as possible and offer free diagnostic services to increase accessibility.

TI Stigma and Ebola survivorship in Liberia: Results from a longitudinal
   cohort study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID VIRUS DISEASE; HIV; TRANSMISSION
AB Background
   Survivors of the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola epidemic have been reported to suffer high levels of stigmatization after return to their communities. We sought to characterize the stigma encountered by a cohort of Ebola survivors in Liberia over time.
   Methods
   Ebola-related stigma was assessed from June 2015 to August 2017 in 299 adolescent and adult Liberian Ebola Survivor Cohort participants at three month intervals using adapted HIV stigma scales scored from 0 to 10 according to the proportion of answers indicating stigmatization.
   Findings
   The median time from Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) to study entry was 393 days (IQR 336492). Participants (43% female) had a median age of 31 (IQR 25-40) years. Mean self-reported stigma levels were greater at baseline (6.28 +/- 0.15 [IQR: 4.38-8.75]) compared to the first post-baseline visit (0.60 +/- 0.10 [IQR: 0-0]; p<0.0001). During follow-up, stigma levels were stable. Baseline stigma significantly increased during enrollment and following clusters of Ebola re-emergence in Liberia. Survivors encountered primarily enacted and perceived external stigma rather than internalized stigma.
   Conclusions
   Ebola-related stigma was prevalent among Liberian survivors more than a year after EVD recovery. Self-reported stigma was greater in the period before cohort enrollment; however, some degree of stigmatization persisted years after EVD. Transient rises in stigma wereobserved following episodic Ebola re-emergence of EVD in Liberia. During future EVD outbreaks, enhanced public health interventions designed to prevent and mitigate Ebola-related stigma that is enacted and external should be implemented to support survivor recovery and community re-integration.

TI Determining factors for the increase in self-referrals to the Emergency
   Department of a rural hospital in Huelva (Spain)
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID VISITS; ACCIDENT; CARE; REASONS
AB Objective
   To analyse the increase of self-referral patients at the Emergency Department of Riotinto District Hospital (in Huelva, Spain) during a short period. The study focused on patients' profiles to identify key factors that explained the increase of self-referrals.
   Material and methods
   Retrospective descriptive study using patient's data from a hospital emergency department between 2003-2015, excluding the period 2012-14 due to the lack of records. Socio-demographic variables, type of referral, access to health services, hospital route, transfer time and organisational changes were analysed, among other factors. Descriptive statistics, chisquare test, and binary logistic regression analysis were used.
   Results
   Self-referral patients to the hospital emergency department revealed a growing trend. Logistic regression model showed that the variables that best predict its occurrence were the health system changes from 2008 and the time it takes to get to the Extra-hospital Emergency Services, where those changes act as modifiers of the effect. From 2008, the likelihood of self-referral in towns with an Extra-hospital Emergency Service over 2 minutes away by car was of 76.43%. When including the triage level, the logistic regression model showed that 83.1% of patients referred themselves.
   Conclusions
   Changes in the health system and in the time for patients to get to the reference hospital from their origin, affect the likelihood of self-referral to the emergency department. Once the patient's severity level was included, this variable, along with the time to get to the emergency department, modified the probability of self-referral to the emergency department. We found an increase in hospital services together with a reduction of resources in the primary care emergency system. This may have led to inefficiencies in the public health system, together with an increase in self-referrals and greater problems to service users.

ID VIVAX MALARIA
AB BackgroundPlasmodium ovale spp. and P. malariae cause illness in endemic regions and returning travellers. Far less is known about these species than P. falciparum and P. vivax.MethodsThe UK national surveillance data, collected 1987 to 2015, were collated with the International Passenger Survey and climatic data to determine geographical, temporal and seasonal trends of imported P. ovale spp. and P. malariae infection.ResultsOf 52,242 notified cases of malaria, 6.04% (3157) were caused by P. ovale spp. and 1.61% (841) by P. malariae; mortality was 0.03% (1) and 0.12% (1), respectively. Almost all travellers acquired infection in West or East Africa. Infection rate per travel episode fell fivefold during the study period. The median latency of P. malariae and P. ovale spp. was 18 and 76days, respectively; delayed presentation occurred with both species. The latency of P. ovale spp. infection imported from West Africa was significantly shorter in those arriving in the UK during the West African peak malarial season compared to those arriving outside it (44days vs 94days, p<0.0001), implying that relapse synchronises with the period of high malarial transmission. This trend was not seen in P. ovale spp. imported from East Africa nor in P. malariae.ConclusionIn West Africa, where malaria transmission is highly seasonal, P. ovale spp. may have evolved to relapse during the malarial high transmission season. This has public health implications. Deaths are very rare, supporting current guidelines emphasising outpatient treatment. However, late presentations do occur.

AB Indigenous peoples in Canada experience disproportionate rates of suicide compared to non-Indigenous populations. Indigenous communities and organizations have designed local and regional approaches to prevention, and the federal government has developed a national suicide prevention framework. However, public health systems continue to face challenges in monitoring the population burden of suicide and suicidal behaviour. National health data systems lack Indigenous identifiers, do not capture data from some regions, and do not routinely engage Indigenous communities in data governance. These challenges hamper efforts to detect changes in population-level outcomes and assess the impact of suicide prevention activities. Consequently, this limits the ability to achieve public health prevention goals and reduce suicide rates and rate inequities.
   This paper provides a critical analysis of the challenges related to suicide surveillance in Canada and assesses the strengths and limitations of existing data infrastructure for monitoring outcomes in Indigenous communities. To better understand these challenges, we discuss the policy context for suicide surveillance and examine the survey and administrative data sources that are commonly used in public health surveillance. We then review recent data on the epidemiology of suicide and suicidal behaviour among Indigenous populations, and identify challenges related to national surveillance.
   To enhance capacity for suicide surveillance, we propose strategies to better track progress in Indigenous suicide prevention. Specifically, we recommend establishing an independent community and scientific governing council, integrating Indigenous identifiers into population health datasets, increasing geographic coverage, improving suicide data quality, comprehensiveness, and timeliness, and developing a platform for making suicide data accessible to all stakeholders. Overall, the strategies we propose can build on the strengths of the existing national suicide surveillance system by adopting a collaborative and inclusive governance model that recognizes the stake Indigenous communities have in suicide prevention.

AB Salmonella infections remain an important public health issue in Canada and worldwide. Although the majority of Salmonella cases are self-limiting, some will lead to severe symptoms and occasionally severe invasive infections, especially in vulnerable populations such as seniors. This study was performed to assess temporal trends of Salmonella cases in seniors over 15 years (2014-2028) and assess possible impact of demographic shift on national incidence; taking into account of trends in other age groups. The numbers of reported Salmonella cases in seniors (60 years and over) in eight provinces and territories for a period of fifteen years were analysed (1998-2013) using a time-adjusted Poisson regression model. With the demographic changes predicted in the age-structure of the population and in the absence of any targeted interventions, our analysis showed the incidence of Salmonella cases in seniors could increase by 16% by 2028 and the multi-provincial incidence could increase by 5.3%. As a result, the age distribution amongst the Salmonella cases is expected to change with a higher proportion of cases in seniors and a smaller proportion in children (0-4 years old). Over the next decades, cases of infection, hospitalizations and deaths associated with Salmonella in seniors could represent a challenge to public health due to an aging population in Canada. As life expectancy increases in Canada, identification of unique risk factors and targeted prevention in seniors should be pursued to reduce the impact of the demographic shift on disease incidence.

TI Comparing individual-level clinical data from antenatal records with
   routine health information systems indicators for antenatal care in the
   West Bank: A cross-sectional study
SO PLOS ONE

AB Background
   In most low- and middle-income settings, national aggregate health data is the most consistently available source for policy-making and international comparisons. In the West Bank, the paper-based health information system with manual aggregations is transitioning to an individual-level data eRegistry for maternal and child health at the point-of-care. The aim of this study was to explore beforehand how routine health information systems indicators for antenatal care can change with the introduction of the eRegistry.
   Methods
   Data were collected from clinical antenatal paper records of pregnancy enrollments for 2015 from 17 primary healthcare clinics, selected by probability sampling from five districts in the West Bank. We used the individual-level data from clinical records to generate routinely reported health systems indicators. We weighted the data to produce population-level estimates, and compared these indicators with aggregate routine health information systems reports.
   Results
   Antenatal anemia screening at 36 weeks was 20% according to the clinical records data, compared to 52% in the routine reports. The clinical records data showed considerably higher incidences of key maternal conditions compared to the routine reports, including fundal height discrepancy (20% vs. 0.01%); Rh-negative blood group (6.8% vs. 1.4%); anemia with hemoglobin <9.5 g/dl (6% vs. 0.6%); and malpresentation at term (1.3% vs. 0.03%). Only about a sixth of cases with these conditions were referred according to guidelines to designated referral clinics.
   Conclusions
   Differences between indicators from the clinical records data and routine health information systems reports can be attributed to human error, inconsistent denominators, and complexities of data processes. Key health systems indicators were prone to underestimations since their registration was dependent on referral of pregnant women. With a transition to individual-level data, as in the eRegistry under implementation, the public health authorities will be able to generate reliable health systems indicators reflective of the population's health status.

AB Background: The incidence and mortality from prostate cancer is expected to increase in the next decade in Thailand. Despite the perceived lower risk in this population vs. developed, western countries, it is becoming an important public health issue. Prostate cancer incidence varies between the most predominant religious groups in Thailand, Buddhists and Muslims. However limited data is available describing the prostate cancer survival in these two populations. Here we examine differences in prostate tumor characteristics and survival between Buddhists and Muslims in the province of Songkhla, Thailand.
   Methods: 945 incident prostate cancer cases (1990-2014) from the population-based Songkhla Cancer Registry were used in this analysis. Age, grade, stage, and year at diagnosis were compared across religious groups, using Wilcoxon or Chi-square tests. Kaplan Meier methods were used to estimate the median survival time and 5-year survival probabilities. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) between religious groups and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for mortality in age-adjusted and fully-adjusted models.
   Results: Prostate tumor characteristics, age, and year at diagnosis were similar across religious groups. The median survival time after diagnosis of prostate cancer was longer in Buddhists 3.8 years compared with Muslims 3.2 years (p = 0.08). The age-adjusted risk of death after prostate cancer diagnosis was higher in Muslims compared with Buddhists (HR: 1.31; 95%CI: 1.00, 1.72). After adjustment by stage and grade, results were slightly attenuated (HR: 1.27, 95%CI: 0.97, 1.67).
   Conclusion: Muslims have shorter survival after prostate cancer diagnosis than do Buddhists in Thailand. The reasons underlying this difference require additional investigation in order to design targeted interventions for both populations.

AB Background: Hand hygiene is a simple and low-cost measure to reduce healthcare associated infection yet it has always been a concern in low as well as high resource settings across the globe. Poor hand hygiene during intra-partum and newborn care may result in sepsis, which is a major cause of death among newborns and puts a financial burden on already strained health systems.
   Methods: We conducted non-participatory observations in newborn care units and labour rooms from secondary and tertiary level, public and private hospitals, as part of a baseline evaluation of a quality improvement collaborative across two southern states of India. We assessed hand hygiene compliance during examinations and common procedures, using tools adapted from internationally recommended checklists and World Health Organization's concept of five moments of hand hygiene. We assessed differences in compliance by type (public/private), level (secondary/tertiary) and case load (low/intermediate/high). Analysis was adjusted for clustering and weighted as appropriate.
   Results: We included 49 newborn care units (19 private, 30 public) and 35 labour rooms (5 private, 30 public) that granted permission. We observed 3661 contacts with newborns and their environment, 242 per-vaginal examinations and 235 deliveries. For the newborns, a greater proportion of contacts in private newborn units than public complied with all steps of hand hygiene (44% vs 12%, p<0.001), and similarly in tertiary than secondary units (33% vs 12%, p<0.001) but there was no evidence of a difference by case load of the facility (low load-28%; intermediate load-14%; high load- 24%, p=0.246). The component with lowest compliance was glove usage where indicated (20%). For deliveries, hand hygiene compliance before delivery was universal in private facilities but seen in only about one-quarter of observations in public facilities (100% vs 27%, p=0.012). Average overall compliance for hand-hygiene during per-vaginal examinations was 35% and we found no evidence of differences by type of facility.
   Conclusion: Observed compliance with hand hygiene was low overall, although better in private than public facilities in both newborn units and labour rooms. Glove usage was a particular problem in newborn care units.

AB Background: Ecological models suggest that a strategy for increasing physical activity participation within a population is to reconstruct the "social climate". This can be accomplished through 1) changing norms and beliefs, 2) providing direct support for modifying environments, and 3) implementing policies to encourage physical activity. Nevertheless, surveillance efforts have paid limited attention to empirical assessment of social climate. This study responds to this gap by assessing the social climate of physical activity in Canada.
   Methods: A representative sample of Canadian adults (n=2519, male/female=50.3%/49.7%, M-age=49.116.3years) completed an online survey asking them to assess social climate dimensions including social norms of physical (in)activity, perceptions of who causes physical inactivity and who is responsible for solving physical inactivity, and support for physical activity-related policy. Descriptive statistics (frequencies) were calculated. Multinomial logistic regressions were constructed to identify whether demographic variables and physical activity participation associated with social climate dimensions.
   Results: Physical inactivity was considered a serious public health concern by 55% of the respondents; similar to unhealthy diets (58%) and tobacco use (57%). Thirty-nine percent of the respondents reported that they often see other people exercising. Twenty-eight percent of the sample believed that society disapproves of physical inactivity. The majority of respondents (63%) viewed the cause of physical inactivity as both an individual responsibility and other factors beyond an individuals' control. Sixty-seven percent of respondents reported physical inactivity as being both a private matter and a public health matter. Strong support existed for environmental-, individual-, and economic-level policies but much less for legislative approaches. The social climate indicators were associated with respondents' level of physical activity participation and demographic variables in expected directions.
   Conclusion: This study is the first known attempt to assess social climate at a national level, addressing an important gap in knowledge related to advocating for, and implementing population-level physical activity interventions. Future tracking will be needed to identify any temporal (in)stability of these constructs over time and to explore the relationship between physical activity participation and indicators of the national social climate of physical activity.

AB BackgroundAdmitted patients with chronic disease are at high risk of an unplanned hospital readmission, however, little research has examined unplanned readmission among Aboriginal people in Australia. This study aimed to examine whether rates of unplanned 28day hospital readmission, or death, significantly differ between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal patients in New South Wales, Australia, over a nine-year period.MethodsA retrospective cohort analysis of a sample of de-identified linked hospital administrative data was conducted. Eligible patients were: 1) aged 18years old, 2) admitted to an acute facility in a NSW public hospital between 30th June 2005 and 1st July 2014, and 3) admitted with either cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes or renal disease. The primary composite outcome was unplanned readmission or death within 28days of discharge. Generalized linear models and a test for trend were used to assess rates of unplanned readmission or death over time in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal patients with chronic disease, accounting for sociodemographic variables.ResultsThe final study cohort included 122,145 separations corresponding to 48,252 patients (Aboriginal=57.2%, n=27,601; non-Aboriginal=42.8%, n=20,651). 13.9% (n=16,999) of all separations experienced an unplanned readmission or death within 28days of discharge. Death within 28days of discharge alone accounted for only a small number of separations (1.4%; n=1767). Over the nine-year period, Aboriginal separations had a significantly higher relative risk of an unplanned readmission or death (Relative risk=1.34 (1.29, 1.40); p-value <0.0001) compared with non-Aboriginal separations once adjusted for sociodemographic, disease variables and restricted to <75years of age. A test for trend, including an interaction between year and Aboriginal status, showed there was no statistically significant change in proportions over the nine-year period for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal separations (p-value for trend=0.176).ConclusionAboriginal people with chronic disease had a significantly higher risk of unplanned readmission or death 28days post discharge from hospital compared with non-Aboriginal people, and there has been no significant change over the nine year period. It is critical that effective interventions to reduce unplanned readmissions for Aboriginal people are identified.

AB BackgroundUptake of clinical guideline recommendations into routine practice requires changes in attitudes and behaviors of the health care providers. The World Health Organization (WHO) has heavily invested in public health and health promotion globally by developing policy recommendations to guide clinical practice; however, clinical guidelines are often not applied. The success of the implementation of any guidelines depends on consideration of existing barriers and adequately addressing them. Therefore, exploring the context specific barriers and facilitators affecting the primary care providers (PCPs) in Mbarara district, Uganda may provide a practical way of addressing the identified barriers thus influence the PCPs action towards integration of mental healthcare services into PHC.MethodsWe adopted a theoretical model of behavior change; Capability, Opportunity and Motivation developed to understand behavior (COM-B). This was a cross-sectional study which involved using a semi-structured qualitative interview guide to conduct in-depth interviews with PCP's (clinical officers, nurses and midwives).ResultsCapability - inadequacy in knowledge about mental disorders; more comfortable managing patients with a mental problem diagnosis than making a new one; knowledge about mental health was gained during pre-service training; no senior cadre to consultations in mental health; and burdensome to consult the Uganda Clinical Guidelines (UCG). Opportunity - limited supply of hard copies of the UCG; guidelines not practical for local setting; did not regularly deal with clients having mental illness to foster routine usage of the UCG; no sensitization about the UCG to the intended users; and no cues at the health centers to remind the PCPs to use UCG. Motivation - did not feel self-reliant; not seen the UCG at their health facilities; lack of trained mental health specialists; conflicting priorities; and no regulatory measures to encourage screening for mental health.ConclusionsEfforts to achieve successful integration of mental health services into PHC need to fit in the context of the implementers; thus the need to adapt the UCG into local context, have cues to enforce implementation, and optimize the available expertize (mental healthcare providers) in the process.

ID OVERWEIGHT; OBESITY; PARENTS; RISK
AB BackgroundThe National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) is a child weight monitoring system in England, taking place in the first and final years of primary school. Many local authorities consider it important to inform parents if their child is overweight, and do so by letter alongside the offer of support and advice. Such letters have been met with mixed reactions from parents, but research seeking to better understand parents' responses is often limited by reliance on survey data and low participation rates. This study aimed to collect a broad variety of perspectives on the programme by analyzing views expressed in parent-to-parent discussions posted online.MethodsUK-based online parenting fora were used to identify discussion threads based around the NCMP between 2010 and 2017. Thirty-one discussion threads from two parent fora were identified. Thematic analysis was used to identify themes in these data.ResultsThe primary themes identified related to (1) the legitimacy of feedback and judgement from health professionals, (2) the relative importance of collecting population level data above individual preferences, and (3) risks versus benefits of having conversations with children about weight. Most threads adopted an argument, counter-argument' format, providing two sides to each issue raised. Information and opinions consistent with public health messages were frequently provided, such as how data are used, that feedback is intended to be helpful, and the importance of collecting national data. There was little evidence of individual parents shifting their views in response to others' arguments.ConclusionsThis study provides novel insight into peer-to-peer debates about the NCMP, including the arguments parents find convincing and acceptable for and against a national programme to weigh children and provide feedback to parents about their weight. Online fora were used as an opportunity to express criticism or distress, but also to seek advice from peers regarding concerns about whether or not to opt-out. Thus, both general issues related to the legitimacy of population screening and outcomes for individual children were of concern to parents.

TI The lucky ones get cured: Health care seeking among women with pelvic
   organ prolapse in Amhara Region, Ethiopia
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID UTERINE PROLAPSE; RISK-FACTORS; INCONTINENCE; PREVALENCE
AB Background
   The majority of women suffering from maternal morbidities live in resource-constrained settings with diverse barriers preventing access to quality biomedical health care services. This study aims to highlight the dynamics between the public health system and alternative healing through an exploration of the experiences of health care seeking among women living with severe symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse in an impoverished setting.
   Methods
   The data were collected through ethnographic fieldwork at the hospital and community levels in the Amhara region of Ethiopia. The fieldwork included participant observation, 42 semi-structured interviews and two focus group discussions over a period of one year. A group of 24 women with severe symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse served as the study's main informants. Other central groups of informants included health care providers, local healers and actors from the health authorities and non-governmental organisations.
   Results
   Three case stories were chosen to illustrate the key findings related to health care seeking among the informants. The women strove to find remedies for their aggravating ailment, and many navigated between and combined various available healing options both within and beyond the health care sector. Their choices were strongly influenced by poverty, by lack of knowledge about the condition, by their religious and spiritual beliefs and by the shame and embarrassment related to the condition. An ongoing health campaign in the study area providing free surgical treatment for pelvic organ prolapse enabled a study of the experiences related to the introduction of free health services targeting maternal morbidity.
   Conclusions
   This study highlights how structural barriers prevent women living in a resource-constrained setting from receiving health care for a highly prevalent and readily treatable maternal morbidity such as pelvic organ prolapse. Our results illustrate that the provision of free quality services may dramatically alter both health-and illness-related perceptions and conduct in an extremely vulnerable population.

TI Clinical features of 2041 human brucellosis cases in China
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID RELAPSE
AB Background
   Human brucellosis has become a major public health problem in China. However, the available clinical data on brucellosis cases are limited.
   Methods
   We retrospectively reviewed medical charts of 2041 patients with confirmed human brucellosis and prospectively recorded their outcomes by telephone interview. These patients were admitted to the Sixth People's Hospital of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region between 1st January and 31st December 2014. Data on these patients were collected from hospital medical records.
   Results
   Many patients presented with fatigue (67%), fever ( 64%), arthralgia (63%) and sweating (54%). High erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (69%), high C-reactive protein (CRP) (39%), high alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (33%) and high aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (20%) were the most common laboratory findings, especially in acute patients. There was evidence of focal involvement in 90% of patients. A total of 61.5% of brucellosis patients recovered. Multivariate logistic regression analyses suggested that the risk factors key to unfavorable prognosis were: age. 45 years (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.36-2.24), back pain (OR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.16-1.94) and joint tenderness (OR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.13-2.65). The increasing duration of the illness increased the risk of poor prognosis.
   Conclusion
   Patients with brucellosis showed different characteristics in different clinical stages. In China, the chronicity rate of human brucellosis is high. The risk of poor prognosis is increased in patients aged 45 years or older, patients who have had brucellosis for a substantial period of time, and patients with back pain or joint tenderness. The clinical management of brucellosis should be improved to include sensitive diagnostic methods for subacute and chronic brucellosis.

AB Background
   A key barrier to appropriate treatment for malaria, diarrhoea, and pneumonia (MDP) in children under 5 years of age in low income rural settings is the lack of access to quality health care. The WHO and UNICEF have therefore called for the scale-up of integrated community case management (iCCM) using community health workers (CHWs). The current study assessed access to treatment, out-of-pocket expenditure and the quality of treatment provided in the public and private sectors compared to national guidelines, using data collected in a large representative survey of caregivers of children in 205 villages with iCCM-trained CHWs in mid-Western Uganda.
   Results
   The prevalence of suspected malaria, diarrhoea and suspected pneumonia in the preceding two weeks in 6501 children in the study sample were 45%, 11% and 24% respectively. Twenty percent of children were first taken to a CHW, 56% to a health facility, 14% to other providers and no care was sought for 11%. The CHW was more likely to provide appropriate treatment compared to any other provider or to those not seeking care for children with MDP (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.42-1.61, p<0.001). Seeking care from a CHW had the lowest cost outlay (median $0.00, IQR $0.00-$1.80), whilst seeking care to a private doctor or clinic the highest (median $2.80, IQR $1.20-$6.00). We modelled the expected increase in overall treatment coverage if children currently treated in the private sector or not seeking care were taken to the CHW instead. In this scenario, coverage of appropriate treatment for MDP could increase in total from the current rate of 47% up to 64%.
   Conclusion
   Scale-up of iCCM-trained CHW programmes is key to the provision of affordable, high quality treatment for sick children, and can thus significantly contribute to closing the gap in coverage of appropriate treatment.

TI Reaching key populations through key venues: Insights from the Jamaica
   HIV Prevention Program
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SEX; KINGSTON; HIV/AIDS
AB Introduction
   HIV prevention strategies often include outreach to female sex workers at social venues identified as places where people meet new sexual partners. Patrons and staff at these venues may include female sex workers, their clients, as well as others who have high rates of new sexual partnerships. Few studies have compared HIV/STI among venue-based and general populations, across types of venues, or by sub-group of the venue population. Program planners often assume that the prevalence of infection is highest among female sex workers and considerably lower among other people at these venues, but there are few empiric studies assessing the prevalence of infection by sex worker status and type of venue.
   Methods
   In 2011, we used the PLACE method to identify public venues where people meet new sexual partners across Jamaica. The study team visited all venues with reported sex work as well as a 10% random sample of other venues and subsequently interviewed and tested a probability sample of 991 venue patrons and workers for HIV and other STI.
   Results
   Community informants identified 1207 venues. All venues where sex work was reported (735 venues) and a random sample of the remainder (134 of 472) were selected for onsite visits. Of these, 585 were found and operational. At a stratified random sample of venues, survey teams interviewed and tested 717 women and 274 men. 394 women reported recent sex work and 211 of these women reported soliciting clients on the street. Women exchanging sex for money were more likely to be infected with HIV (5.4% vs 1.0%; OR = 5.6, 95% CI = 1.8,17.3) or syphilis (11.7% vs. 5.8%, OR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.7,4,0) than other women, but not significantly more likely to be infected with gonorrhea (8.4% vs 7.8%; OR = 1.1,95% CI = 0.6,1.9), chlamydia (16.2% vs 21.6%; OR = 0.7,95% CI = 0.5,1.0) or trichomoniasis (23.0% vs 17.0%, OR = 1.5,95% CI = 0.9,2.2). Women at venues were more likely to report sex work and multiple partners than women interviewed in a 2008 national population-based household survey commissioned by the Ministry of Health.
   Conclusions
   In Jamaica, although the highest HIV prevalence was among street-based sex workers, the risk of HIV and STI extends to men and women at high risk venues, even those who do not self-identify as sex workers. Findings confirm the appropriateness of outreach to all men and women at these venues.

ID MORTALITY; TRENDS; TIME; CARE
AB Background The control of maternal deaths continues to be a significant public health issue and commands an enormous amount of attention, especially under the future family planning policy. Here, we describe the epidemiology and trends of maternal deaths in Hunan province, and give several policy implications.
   Methods
   Maternal deaths in Hunan province between 2009 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to assess the time trends of maternal mortality rates. Binary logistic regression analyses were undertaken to identify the factors that were associated with unavoidable maternal deaths.
   Results
   In total, there were 987 maternal deaths, with the overall MMR declining by 45.24%. The most common causes of maternal death during this period were pregnancy complications (28.37%), obstetric hemorrhage (25.33%), and amniotic fluid embolism (15.70%). Obstetric hemorrhage (28.14%) was higher in rural areas, while pregnancy complications were higher (29.27%) in urban areas. In all, 627 (63.5%) deaths were avoidable. The risk factors associated with unavoidable maternal deaths was above 35 years (aOR = 1.80 95% CI: 1.27-2.55), without prenatal examination (aOR = 8.97 95% CI: 1.11-7.78), low household incomes (aOR = 1.15 95% CI: 1.02-1.29), without adopting the new way to deliver (aOR = 5.15 95% CI: 3.20-8.31), and death location (aOR = 1.09 95% CI: 1.02-1.18). The most frequent and important factors associated with avoidable deaths was improper knowledge and skills of the county medical institutions.
   Conclusions
   Moderate progress was made in reducing the MMR in Hunan province. The government should aim to improve the basic midwifery skills in rural areas and the obstetric emergency rescue service for critically ill pregnant women in urban areas, and strengthen training to improve knowledge and skills in medical institutions in counties.

AB BackgroundFoodborne acute gastroenteritis is a significant public health concern. Food handling plays a key role in the risk of foodborne acute gastroenteritis. However, research focused on the correlation between foodborne acute gastroenteritis and food handling in the family environment is limited. The purpose of the current study was to determinate the association between food handling behaviors in the family environment and foodborne acute gastroenteritis.MethodsA cross-sectional investigation was conducted from September 1, 2015 to August 30, 2016 in Anhui Province, China. A multistage stratified cluster sampling method was designed to select subjects. Data on foodborne acute gastroenteritis and food handling were collected via questionnaire survey.ResultsOf the 1516 subjects included in the study, 165 (10.9%) reported having experienced symptoms of foodborne acute gastroenteritis in the past 4weeks. The following behaviors were more prevalent in those that experienced acute gastroenteritis: (1) infrequently thoroughly heating milk (75.6%); (2) infrequently thoroughly heating cooked food purchased from outside (71.3%); (3) infrequently thoroughly heating leftovers stored in the refrigerator (32.5%), and (4) infrequently storing leftovers in the refrigerator (41.6%). A multivariate logistic regression analysis found that foodborne acute gastroenteritis was associated with the following behaviors: (1) often eating raw seafood (P<0.001, OR=3.250, 95% CI=2.136-4.946); (2) often storing raw meat and cooked meat in the same container (P<0.001, OR=4.291, 95% CI=2.722-6.765); (3) infrequently thoroughly heating milk (P<0.001, OR=4.665, 95% CI=2.526-8.617); (4) infrequently thoroughly heating leftovers stored in the refrigerator (P<0.001, OR=3.416, 95% CI=2.139-5.454); (5) infrequently storing leftovers in the refrigerator (P<0.05, OR=1.775, 95% CI=1.169-2.696); and (6) infrequently thoroughly cooking green beans (P<0.001, OR=2.859, 95% CI=1.798-4.545).ConclusionsPoor food handling behaviors in the family environment are associated with foodborne acute gastroenteritis. Infrequent thorough heating and improper food storage are the most critical risk factors in foodborne acute gastroenteritis.

AB BackgroundMaternal near miss' can be a proxy for maternal death and it describes women who nearly died due to obstetric complications. It measures life threatening pregnancy related complications and allows the assessment of the quality of obstetric care.MethodsA prospective descriptive study was carried out from October 1 2016 to 31 December 2016, using the WHO criteria for maternal near miss' at the two tertiary public hospitals which receive referrals of all obstetric complications in Harare city, Zimbabwe. The objective was to calculate the ratio of maternal near miss' and associated factors. All pregnant women who developed life threatening complications classified as maternal near miss using the WHO criteria were recruited and followed up for six weeks from discharge, delivery or termination of pregnancy or up to the time of death.ResultsDuring this period there were 11,871 births. One hundred and twenty three (123) women developed severe maternal outcomes, 110 were maternal near miss' morbidity and 13 were maternal deaths. The maternal near miss' ratio was 9.3 per 1000 deliveries, the mortality index (MI) was 10.6% and the maternal mortality ratio was 110 per 100,000 deliveries. The major organ dysfunction among cases with severe maternal outcomes (SMO) was cardiovascular dysfunction (76.9%). The major causes of maternal near miss were obstetric haemorrhage (31.8%), hypertensive disorders (28.2%) and complications of miscarriages (20%). The intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate was 7.3 per 100 cases of SMO and 88.8% of maternal deaths occurred without ICU admission.ConclusionThe MNM ratio was comparable to that in the region. Obstetric haemorrhage was a leading cause of severe maternal morbidity though with less mortality when compared to hypertensive disorders and abortion complications. Zimbabwe should adopt maternal near miss ratio as an indicator for evaluating its maternal health services.

TI Challenges to the improvement of obstetric care in maternity hospitals

AB BackgroundMaternal morbidity and mortality are still serious public health concerns in Brazil, and access to quality obstetric care is one critical point of this problem. Despite efforts, obstetric care quality problems and sub-optimal/poor outcomes persist. The study aimed to identify contextual elements that would potentially affect the implementation of an obstetric care quality improvement intervention.MethodsA qualitative study was conducted in three public maternity hospitals of a large Brazilian city, with high annual volume of births and buy-in from high-level managers. Individual interviews with doctors and nurses were conducted from July to October 2015. Semi-structured interviews sought to explore teamwork, coordination and communication, and leadership, being open to capture other contextual elements that could emerge. Interviews were recorded and transcribed, and the categories of analysis were identified and updated based on the constant comparative method.ResultsTwenty-seven interviews were carried out. Extra-organizational context concerning the dependence of the maternity hospitals on primary care units, responsible for antenatal care, and on other healthcare organizations' services emerged from interviews, but the main findings of the study centered on intra-organizational context with potential to affect healthcare quality and actions for its improvement, including material resources, work organization design, teamwork, coordination and communication, professional responsibility vis-a-vis the patient, and leadership. A major issue was the divergence of physicians' and nurses' perspectives on care quality, which in turn negatively affected their capacity to work together.ConclusionOverall, the findings suggest that care on the maternity hospitals was fragmented and lacked continuity, putting at risk the quality. Redesigning work organization, promoting conditions for multi-professional teamwork, better communication and coordination, improving more systemic accountability/lines of authority, and investing in team members' technical competence, and fitness of organizational structures and processes are all imbricated actions that may contribute to obstetric care quality improvement.

AB Background: Tsetse flies are vectors of African trypanosomes, and their vectorial capacity results in a major public health emergency and vast economic losses in sub-Saharan Africa. Given the limited ability of trypanosome prevention and eradication, tsetse vectors remain major targets of control efforts. Larvae of all three instars are developed in mothers' uteri, nourished through milk, and 'larviposited' shortly before pupation. The past few years have witnessed the emergence of approaches based on knockdown of genes involved in milk production, resulting in a significant reduction of fecundity.
   Results: In order to identify further genes applicable in the control of tsetse flies, we determined the expression of protein-coding genes in ovaries and uteri from both virgin and heavily pregnant Glossina morsitans morsitans females. Comparison of expression profiles allowed us to identify candidate genes with increased expression in pregnant individuals. Lists with the highest increases include genes involved in oocyte and embryonic development, or nourishment. Maximum ovarian fold change does not exceed 700, while the highest uterine fold change reaches to more than 4000. Relatively high fold changes of two neuropeptide receptors (for corazonin and myosuppressin) propose the corresponding genes alternative targets.
   Conclusions: Given the higher fold changes in the uterus, targeting gene expression in this tissue may result in a more evident reduction of fecundity. However, ovaries should not be neglected, as manifested by several genes with top fold changes involved in early developmental stages. Apart from focusing on the highest fold changes, neuropeptide receptors with moderate increases in expression should be also verified as targets, given their roles in mediating the tissue control. However, this data needs to be considered initial, and the potential of these genes in affecting female fecundity needs to be verified experimentally.

AB BackgroundDespite known health benefits of physical activity (PA), older adults remain among the least physically active age group globally with 30-60% not meeting guidelines. In Canada, 87% do not meet recommended guidelines. To influence population health, interventions that are effective in small trials must be disseminated at scale. Despite evidence for efficacy, few PA interventions are scaled up to reach the wider community. In 2015, British Columbia (BC) Ministry of Health released a PA strategy where older adults were identified as a priority. In partnership with the Ministry, the Active Aging Research Team co-created a health promotion program called Choose to Move (CTM). CTM will be implemented in three phases at increasingly greater scale across BC. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of CTM during Phase I (pilot) and Phase II (initial scale up) on PA, mobility, and social connectedness among older adults in BC, Canada.MethodsWe used a type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study design, and herein focus on effectiveness. The implementation evaluation will be published as a companion paper elsewhere. Two community delivery partner organizations delivered 56 CTM programs in 26 large and small urban locations across BC. Outcome measurement occurred at 0 (baseline), 3 (mid-intervention) and 6 (post-intervention) months. We collected survey data from all participants (n=458; province-wide) and also conducted a subset evaluation (n=209).ResultsPA increased significantly during the active intervention phase (baseline-3months) in younger (60-74yrs.; +1.6days/week; p<0.001) and older (75yrs.; +1.0days/week; p<0.001) participants. The increase was sustained at 6months in younger participants only, who remained significantly more active than at baseline (+1.4days/week; p<0.001). Social exclusion indicators declined significantly in the younger group. Mobility and strength improved significantly at 3months in the younger group, and in both groups at 6months.ConclusionsCTM adopted central tenets of implementation science that consider the complicated systems where interventions are delivered to improve public health. In this iteration of CTM we demonstrate that a partner-based health promotion intervention can be effectively implemented across settings to enhance PA, mobility and social connectedness in older adults.

AB BackgroundSubstance use and abuse by young adolescents has become a serious issue for public health services, and several socio-environmental factors can influence how vulnerable a young adolescent may be to their appeal. The present study was devised to examine whether substance use in early adolescence is associated with problematic social networking site usage (PSNSU).MethodsIn the academic year 2013-2014, secondary schools in Padua (north-eastern Italy) were involved in a survey called Pinocchio. A sample of 1325 pupils attending years 6 to 8 (i.e. aged from 11 to 13years) completed self-administered questionnaires, in which PSNSU was measured by applying the DSM-IV criteria of dependence to identify any social network addiction disorder and its fallout on daily life. Multivariate analysis (ordered logistic regression) was performed to assess an adjusted association between young adolescents' substance use and PSNSU.ResultsThe percentage of pupils classified as problematic social networking site users rose with age (from 14.6% in year 6 to 24.3% in year 7, and 37.2% in year 8), and it was higher in girls (27.1%) than in boys (23.6%). In a fully-adjusted model, PSNSU conferred a higher likelihood of being substance users (OR 2.93 95% CI 1.77-4.85).ConclusionThis study identified an association between PSNSU and the likelihood of substance use (smoking, alcohol and energy drink consumption), providing further evidence of the need to pay more attention to PSNSU in early adolescence.

AB BackgroundPregnancy is a period of transition with important physical and emotional changes. Even in uncomplicated pregnancies, these changes can affect the quality of life (QOL) of pregnant women, affecting both maternal and infant health. The objectives of this study were to describe the quality of life during uncomplicated pregnancy and to assess its associated socio-demographic, physical and psychological factors in developed countries.MethodsA systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. Searches were made in PubMed, EMBASE and BDSP (Public Health Database). Two independent reviewers extracted the data. Countries with a human development index over 0.7 were selected. The quality of the articles was evaluated on the basis of the STROBE criteria.ResultsIn total, thirty-seven articles were included. While the physical component of QOL decreased throughout pregnancy, the mental component was stable and even showed an improvement during pregnancy. Main factors associated with better QOL were mean maternal age, primiparity, early gestational age, the absence of social and economic problems, having family and friends, doing physical exercise, feeling happiness at being pregnant and being optimistic. Main factors associated with poorer QOL were medically assisted reproduction, complications before or during pregnancy, obesity, nausea and vomiting, epigastralgia, back pain, smoking during the months prior to conception, a history of alcohol dependence, sleep difficulties, stress, anxiety, depression during pregnancy and sexual or domestic violence.ConclusionsHealth-related quality of life refers to the subjective assessment of patients regarding the physical, mental and social dimensions of well-being. Improving the quality of life of pregnant women requires better identification of their difficulties and guidance which offers assistance whenever possible.

AB BackgroundThe emergence of serious issues of multidrug resistance in the past few years have enforced the use of bacteriocins for combating infections. Threat posed to public health by various multidrug resistant (MDR) organisms can be resolved by discovering new antimicrobial proteins with broad spectrum of inhibition.ResultsIn the current study, Bacteriocin (BAC-IB17) produced by Bacillus subtilis KIBGE-IB17 is found to be effective against different strains of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The approximate molecular mass of BAC-IB17 is 10.7kDa. This unique bacteriocin is found to be highly thermostable and pH stable in nature. It also showed its stability against various heavy metals, organic solvents, surfactants and proteolytic enzymes. Amino acid profile of BAC-IB17 clearly showed that this protein mainly consists of non-polar and basic amino acids whereas; some acidic amino acids were also detected. Sequence of first 15 amino acid residues obtained from N-terminal sequencing of BAC-IB17 were NKPEALVDYTGVXNS.ConclusionsThe anti-MRSA property of purified bacteriocin may be used to prevent the spread of MRSA infections. Remarkable features of BAC-IB17 suggests its applications in various pharmaceutical and food industries as it can function under a variety of harsh environmental conditions.

AB BackgroundMany youth and young adults experience high noise exposure compounded by lack of access to hearing health education. Although the need for hearing health education programs is evident, the efficacy of these programs for youth is unclear. We evaluated the literature for efficacy of various hearing conservation programs aimed at youth and young adults, and analyzed their strengths and limitations.MethodsStudies reporting results of hearing conservation or hearing loss prevention programs with youth or young adults, using randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental designs, experimental design, or qualitative research, and published in peer-reviewed journals in English between 2001 and 2018 were included. Studies were found through searches of selected literature databases (i.e., PubMed, Google Scholar, NIOSH Toxline, and Scopus). Identified publications were assessed for relevance, and data were extracted from the studies deemed relevant.ResultsA total of 10 studies were included. Very little evidence of efficacy of hearing conservation educational programs was found in these studies. Several methodological limitations including lack of rigorous study designs, inadequate power, and application of inappropriate statistical analysis were noted. Some use of technology in programs (e.g., smartphone apps, mobile phone text messages, and computers) was observed, but conclusions as to the effectiveness of these tools were limited by the small number of studies and small sample sizes.ConclusionsThe number of studies of educational hearing conservation programs for youth and young adults was low. The efficacy of the program was not reported in most studies, and it is difficult to draw public health conclusions from these studies due to their multiple methodological limitations. While use of technology in hearing conservation educational programs offers promise, its effectiveness has not been studied.

ID IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM; CHILDSMILE
AB Background: Link workers (lay health workers, health support workers) based in the community provide additional support to individuals and families to facilitate engagement with primary care and other services and resources. This additional support aims to tackle the wider socio-economic determinants of health that lead to inequalities. To date, there is no clear evidence of the effectiveness of these programmes. This study evaluates the effectiveness of Dental Health Support Workers (DHSW) at linking targeted families with young children to primary care dental practices. The DHSW role is one component of Childsmile, the national oral health improvement programme in Scotland.
   Methods: A quasi-experimental approach captured the natural variation in the rollout of the DHSW intervention across Scotland in a cohort of children born between 2010 and 2013. Survival analysis explored time to attendance at primary care dental practice. Cox's regression models compared attendance rates and time until first attendance between those families who received support from the DHSW and those who did not.
   Results: The cohort consisted of 35236 children. Thirty-three percent of the cohort (n = 11495) were considered to require additional support from a DHSW. Of these, 44% (5087) received that support. These families were more likely to attend a dental practice (Hazard Ratio [95% Confidence Interval] =1.87 [1.8 to 1.9]) and, on average, did so 9 months earlier (median time until first attendance: 8.8 months versus 17.8 months), compared to families not receiving additional support.
   Conclusions: Link workers (DHSW) within the Childsmile programme are effective at linking targeted children to primary care dental services and, most notably, at a younger age for prevention. This is the first study of its kind to evaluate the effectiveness of link-worker programmes using a robust quasi-experimental design on three, population-wide, linked datasets. These results will inform future health programmes which aim to improve health and reduce inequalities by reaching and supporting families from more disadvantaged backgrounds.

AB Introduction
   Reducing neonatal mortality rate (NMR) is a challenge in many low- and middle-income countries including Bangladesh. In 2014, the estimated NMR in this country was 28 per 1,000 live births. This rate is higher in rural regions compared to the national average. Currently, Sylhet Division has the highest NMR in Bangladesh. Investigating rates and determinants of neonatal mortality in rural regions of this high-risk division is particularly important to implement evidence-based programs. This study examined rates and determinants of neonatal deaths in a large rural cohort in Sylhet Division.
   Methods
   We analyzed data from a multi-country cohort study, Aetiology of Neonatal Infections in South Asia. From November 2011 to December 2013, this study was conducted in two rural sub-districts in Sylhet Division. Community health workers followed 28,960 pregnant women and their newborns up to two months postpartum and collected data on pregnancy outcomes and newborns' survival status. The NMR was obtained by dividing total number of neonatal deaths with all studied newborns. Logistic regression was employed to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (Cis) for factors associated with neonatal mortality. Stata 14.0 was used for data analysis.
   Results
   This study analyzed data of 21,227 newborns. The NMR was 43.4 (95% CI: 39.3-48.0) per 1,000 live births (N = 922). Multivariable analysis showed that the odds of neonatal mortality were significantly higher among male newborns (AOR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2-1.8), babies born before 34 weeks of gestation (AOR: 5.0, 95% CI: 4.1-6.1), those who were twins or triplets (AOR: 6.2, 95% CI: 3.6-10.9), and first-born child (AOR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.6-5.3). Additionally, maternal age 30-35 years (AOR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.-1.8), history of child death (AOR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.2-2.2), and delivery complications (AOR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.6-2.6) had positive associations with neonatal deaths.
   Conclusion
   Public health programs in Bangladesh need to adopt a comprehensive strategy to address the individual, maternal, and intrapartum factors associated with neonatal mortality in rural regions. Interventions should aim to prioritize managing pre-term deliveries, first-born child, and delivery complications among pregnant women.

AB Antibiotic dispensing without a prescription poses a threat to public health as it leads to excessive antibiotic consumption. Inappropriate antibiotic availability to the community has been documented to be amongst drivers of antimicrobial resistance emergence. Community pharmacies are a source of antibiotics in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). We aimed at assessing antibiotic dispensing practices by community pharmacy retailers in Moshi urban, Kilimanjaro, Tanzania and recommend interventions to improve practice. Using a Simulated Client (SC) Method, an observational cross-sectional survey of antibiotic dispensing practices was conducted from 10th June to 10th July 2017. Data analysis was done using Stata 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). A total of 82 pharmacies were visited. Part I pharmacies were 26 (31.71%) and 56 (68.29%) were part II. Overall 92.3% (95% CI 77.8-97.6) of retailers dispensed antibiotics without prescriptions. The antibiotics most commonly dispensed without a prescription were ampiclox for cough (3 encounters) and azithromycin for painful urination (3 encounters). An oral third generation cephalosporin (cefixime) was dispensed once for painful urination without prescription by a part I pharmacy retailer. Out of 21, 15(71.43%) prescriptions with incomplete doses were accepted and had antibiotics dispensed. Out of 68, 4(5.9%) retailers gave instructions for medicine use voluntarily. None of the retailers voluntarily explained drug side-effects. In Moshi pharmacies, a high proportion of antibiotics are sold and dispensed without prescriptions. Instructions for medicine use are rarely given and none of the retailers explain side effects. These findings support the need for a legislative enforcement of prescription-only antibiotic dispensing rules and regulations. Initiation of clinician and community antibiotic stewardship and educational programs on proper antibiotic use to both pharmacists and public by the regulatory bodies are highly needed.

TI Local anesthesia underutilized for inguinal hernia repair in northern
   Ghana
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article

AB Introduction
   Inguinal hernia repair is a common procedure and a priority for public health efforts in Ghana. It is essential that inguinal hernia repair be performed in a safe, efficient manner to justify its widespread use. Local anesthesia has many favorable properties and has been shown to be superior, compared to regional or general anesthesia, in terms of pain control, safety profile, cost-effectiveness, resources required, and time to discharge. Local anesthesia is recommended for open repair of reducible hernias, provided clinician experience, by multiple international guidelines. Regional anesthesia is associated with myocardial infarction and other complications, and its use is discouraged by multiple guidelines, especially in older patients. This study aims to assess the current state of anesthesia for inguinal hernia repair in the northern and transitional zone of Ghana. In addition we will assess the perceptions of different types of anesthesia along with understanding of evidence-based guidelines among clinicians participating in inguinal hernia repair.
   Methods
   We performed a retrospective review of all inguinal hernia repairs for male patients, 18 and older, in over 90% of hospitals in northern Ghana. All 41 hospitals were visited and caselogs and patient charts were manually reviewed to extract data. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine predictors of local anesthesia use. We designed a survey instrument to assess the perceptions of physicians and anesthetists regarding different types of anesthesia for inguinal hernia repair. The survey was designed by a Ghanaian surgeon, reviewed by all co-authors, and tested prior to implementation using a sample (n = 8) of clinicians having similar practices to those of the survey population. Of 70 clinicians, 66 responded, yielding a response rate of 94%.
   Results
   8080 patients underwent hernia repair of which 37% were performed under local anesthesia, while the majority, 60%, were performed under regional anesthesia. Negative predictors of local anesthesia were emergent repair (OR = 0.258, p < 0.001), surgery performed at a teaching hospital (OR = 0.105, p < 0.001), and bilateral hernia repair (OR = 0.374, p < 0.001). 1,839 (22.8%) of IH repairs were done on patients age 65 or older and RA was most frequently used among the elderly population (57.8%), while local anesthesia was used 39.5% of the time. Sixty-six clinicians participated in the survey with the majority reporting that local anesthesia requires fewer staff, less equipment, has a shorter recovery, is more cost-effective, and might be safer for patients. However 66% were unfamiliar with or incorrectly perceived international guidelines.
   Conclusion
   To our knowledge, this study is the largest assessment of anesthesia use for inguinal hernia repair in an LMIC. Although the selection of anesthetic technique should be guided by a patient's general health, the anatomy of the hernia, and clinician judgment, local anesthesia appears to be underutilized in northern Ghana. Survey responses demonstrate high rates of unfamiliarity or incorrectly perceived evidence-based guidelines. Future research should assess how education on the benefits and technique of local anesthesia administration may further increase rates for inguinal hernia repair, especially for older patients.

ID TANZANIA
AB Background Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of the Human Immunodeficiency -Virus (HIV) is a serious public health problem, contributing up to 90% of childhood HIV infections. In Tanzania, the prevention-of-mother-to-child-transmission (PMTCT) feature of the HIV programme was rolled out in 2000. The components of PMTCT include counselling and HIV testing directed at antenatal clinic attendees. It is through the process of Provider Initiated Counseling and Testing (PITC) that counselling is offered participant confidentiality and voluntariness are upheld and valid consent obtained.
   The objective of the study was to explore antenatal clinic attendees' experiences of the concept of voluntariness vis- a- vis the implementation of prior counseling and subsequent testing for HIV under the PITC as part of their antenatal care.
   Methods In-depth interviews were conducted with17 antenatal clinic attendees and 6 nursing officers working at the Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) antenatal clinic. The study data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis.
   Results Antenatal clinic attendees' accounts suggested that counselling and testing for HIV during pregnancy was voluntary, and that knowledge of their HIV status led them to access appropriate treatment for both mother and her newborn baby. They reported feeling no pressure from nursing officers, and gave verbal consent to undergo the HIV test. However, some antenatal clinic attendees reported pressure from their partners to test for HIV. Healthcare providers were thus faced with a dilemma of disclosure/nondisclosure when dealing with discordant couples.
   Conclusion Antenatal clinic attendees at MNH undertook the PITC for HIV voluntarily. This was enhanced by their prior knowledge of HIV, the need to prevent mother- to- child transmission of HIV, and the effectiveness of the voluntary policy implemented by nursing officers.

AB Background: Family members are increasingly involved in the care of cancer patients, however many are not prepared for this challenging role. Intervention-based studies are valuable to inform the most appropriate and effective support for caregivers. Barriers in the recruitment of patient/caregiver dyads exist but the reasons for non-participation are less well understood. This analysis determined the factors associated with participation in a randomized controlled trial involving patient/caregiver dyads, reasons for non-participation and factors associated with these reasons.
   Methods: Patients with any type of cancer (other than non-melanoma skin cancer), and their caregiver were recruited at four Australian health services. Eligible patients were invited to participate together with their caregiver (N=737). Non-participation data were collected from non-participants. Bivariate and binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine factors associated with participation.
   Results: Of the 737 eligible dyads, 521 (71%) declined participation. Dyad characteristics associated with participation were caregiver gender, patient treatment modality and hospital type. The odds for participating were almost two times greater for female than male caregivers (p = 0.005); 13 times greater for patients receiving chemoradiotherapy compared to radiotherapy alone (p < 0.001); and three times greater for dyads attending a private versus public hospital (p < 0.001). Reasons for non-participation were lack of interest (33%), lack of time (29%), not requiring support (23%), too burdensome (15%); factors significantly associated with these reasons were treatment modality, patient age, cancer type, and hospital type. Patients diagnosed with prostate cancer and receiving chemotherapy alone were less likely to decline due to a lack of interest. Patients more likely to decline due to lack of time were those aged 40-59 years and receiving chemotherapy alone. Patients who were more likely to decline because they felt participation was too burdensome were those attending a private hospital for treatment.
   Conclusions: To optimize recruitment, it is recommended that special attention is given to different cancer types and treatment modalities, gender and age. Approaching dyads at varied time points when their need for support is high is recommended. This analysis provides important information for researchers undertaking randomized controlled trials involving people diagnosed with cancer and their caregivers .

AB Background: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) describes a combination of risk factors that increase the risk of developing chronic diseases. The prevalences of MetS and its risk factors are increasing, especially in the Arab region. A cross-sectional study was carried out to assess the prevalences of MetS and its associated risk factors among adolescents in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
   Methods: A total of 596 students (308 boys and 288 girls) aged 10 to 15.9 years old were recruited from 14 public secondary schools in Dubai, UAE. Anthropometric and biochemical data were measured.
   Results: According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria, the prevalence of MetS was 3.7%, and it was more common among boys than girls (12 boys versus 10 girls). MetS was also more likely to be found in students who were obese or overweight than those with normal weight. The most prevalent and significant MetS risk factor was low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels.
   Conclusions: This study indicates the importance of carrying out further investigations about the constituents of HDL and their atherogenic effects. Additionally, these results strongly recommend setting a consensus for HDL measurement, since small variations in methodologies may lead to substantial deviations in results.

AB Background: There is a lack of evidence regarding clusters of health-related behaviors among adolescents from low, lower-middle, and upper-middle income countries. This study aimed to identify clustering patterns of health-related behaviors (diet, physical activity [PA] and sedentary behavior [SB]) and association with sociodemographic variables among a population-based sample of Brazilian adolescents.
   Methods: Cross-sectional data from the 2015 National School-Based Health Survey (PeNSE). A total of 102,072 (females: 51.7%) students in ninth-grade (age: 14.31.1 years-old) enrolled in public and private schools were investigated in this study. Healthy and unhealthy diet, PA and SB were measured using a validated questionnaire. Two-step cluster analysis was conducted to identify lifestyle patterns. The methodology for complex analysis and weighting was used to inferential statistical procedures. Multinomial logistic regression assessed associations between sociodemographic factors and the clusters.
   Results: Three reliable and meaningful clusters were identified and labelled as follows: (1) health-promoting SB and diet (32.6%); (2) health-promoting PA and diet (44.9%), and (3) health-risk (22.5%). Compared to boys, girls were less likely to be in clusters 1 (OR=0.85; 95% CI=0.78-0.93, p<0.001) and 2 (OR=0.43; 95% CI=0.40-0.46, p<0.001) than the health-risk cluster. Higher socioeconomic status was positively associated with health-promoting PA and diet, and negatively related to health-promoting SB and diet. Older adolescents were more likely to be in cluster 1 than in cluster 3, compared to younger adolescents.
   Conclusion: Approximately one-quarter of the population (health-risk cluster) reported engaging in multiple risk behaviors. Interventions may need to be tailored to specific adolescent groups, especially considering sociodemographic differences.

AB Background: Antibiotic resistance and its rapid dissemination around the world threaten the efficacy of currently-used medical treatments and call for novel, innovative approaches to manage multi-drug resistant infections. Phage therapy, i.e., the use of viruses (phages) to specifically infect and kill bacteria during their life cycle, is one of the most promising alternatives to antibiotics. It is based on the correct matching between a target pathogenic bacteria and the therapeutic phage. Nevertheless, correctly matching them is a major challenge. Currently, there is no systematic method to efficiently predict whether phage-bacterium interactions exist and these pairs must be empirically tested in laboratory. Herein, we present our approach for developing a computational model able to predict whether a given phage-bacterium pair can interact based on their genome.
   Results: Based on public data from GenBank and phagesDB.org, we collected more than a thousand positive phage-bacterium interactions with their complete genomes. In addition, we generated putative negative (i.e., non-interacting) pairs. We extracted, from the collected genomes, a set of informative features based on the distribution of predictive protein-protein interactions and on their primary structure (e.g. amino-acid frequency, molecular weight and chemical composition of each protein). With these features, we generated multiple candidate datasets to train our algorithms. On this base, we built predictive models exhibiting predictive performance of around 90% in terms of F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, obtained on the test set with 10-fold cross-validation.
   Conclusion: These promising results reinforce the hypothesis that machine learning techniques may produce highly-predictive models accelerating the search of interacting phage-bacteria pairs.

AB Background: Patient medicines helplines provide a means of accessing medicines-related support following hospital discharge. However, it is unknown how many National Health Service (NHS) Trusts currently provide a helpline, nor how they are operated. Using the RE-AIM evaluation framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance), we sought to obtain key data concerning the provision and use of patient medicines helplines in NHS Trusts in England. This included the extent to which the delivery of helplines meet with national standards that are endorsed by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (standards pertaining to helpline access, availability, and promotion).
   Methods: An online survey was sent to Medicines Information Pharmacists and Chief Pharmacists at all 226 acute, mental health, specialist, and community NHS Trusts in England in 2017.
   Results: Adoption: Fifty-two percent of Trusts reported providing a patient medicines helpline (acute: 67%; specialist: 41%; mental health: 29%; community: 18%). Reach: Helplines were predominantly available for discharged inpatients, outpatients, and carers (98%, 95% and 93% of Trusts, respectively), and to a lesser extent, the local public (22% of Trusts). The median number of enquiries received per week was five. Implementation: For helpline access, 54% of Trusts reported complying with all 'satisfactory' standards, and 26% reported complying with all 'commendable' standards. For helpline availability, the percentages were 86% and 5%, respectively. For helpline promotion, these percentages were 3% and 40%. One Trust reported complying with all standards. Maintenance: The median number of years that helplines had been operating was six. Effectiveness: main perceived benefits included patients avoiding harm, and improving patients' medication adherence.
   Conclusions: Patient medicines helplines are provided by just over half of NHS Trusts in England. However, the proportion of mental health and community Trusts that operate a helpline is less than half of that of the acute Trusts, and there are regional variations in helpline provision. Adherence to the national standards could generally be improved, although the lowest adherence was regarding helpline promotion. Recommendations to increase the use of helplines include increasing the number of promotional methods used, the number of ways to contact the service, and the number of hours that the service is available.

AB BackgroundTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex condition and remains a prominent public and medical health issue in individuals of all ages. A rapid increase in extracellular glutamate occurs after TBI, leading to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, which causes neuronal damage and further functional impairments. Although inhibition of glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCP II) is considered a potential approach for reducing glutamate-induced excitotoxicity after TBI, further detailed evidence regarding its efficacy is required. Therefore, in this study, we examined the differences in the metabolite status between wild-type (WT) and GCP II gene-knockout (KO) mice after TBI using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with a 7-tesla imaging system, and brain water-content analysis.ResultsEvaluation of glutamate and N-acetylaspartate concentrations revealed a decrease in both levels in the ipsilateral hippocampus at 24h post-TBI; however, the reduction in glutamate and N-acetylaspartate levels was less marked in GCP II-KO mice than in WT mice (p<0.05). T2 MR data and brain water-content analysis demonstrated that the extent of cortical edema and brain swelling was less in KO than in WT mice after TBI (p<0.05).ConclusionUsing two non-invasive methods, 1H-MRS and T2 MR imaging, as well as in vitro brain-water content measurements, we demonstrated that the mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effects of GCP II-KO against brain swelling in TBI involves changes in glutamate and N-acetylaspartate levels. This knowledge may contribute towards the development of therapeutic strategies for TBI.

AB Background
   Dystonia is a group of chronic diseases, causing considerable physical and psychosocial stress to patients and health care expenses. We studied the prevalence of different dystonia types in Finland in the years 2007-2016.
   Methods
   All patients with an ICD-10 code of dystonia were retrieved from the national care register. Average age-adjusted yearly prevalence was assessed for adult-onset isolated idiopathic or hereditary dystonia types from patient records from the Uusimaa and Pirkanmaa provinces.
   Results
   1316 patients were confirmed to have adult-onset isolated idiopathic or hereditary dystonia based on hospital records from two provinces. On average, the age-adjusted prevalence for all adult-onset dystonia was 405 per million and for cervical dystonia 304 per million. For other dystonia types the prevalence ranged from 1-33 per million.
   Conclusions
   Adult onset cervical dystonia was the most common type of dystonia with relatively high prevalence in Finland compared with other countries. The prevalence of other types of dystonia was similar compared with other European studies. The higher prevalence of cervical dystonia may be partially explained by the better coverage of patients in public health care, but genetic and exogenous factors might contribute to it.

AB BackgroundAssessing patients' experience with primary care complements measures of clinical health outcomes in evaluating service performance. Measuring patients' experience and satisfaction are among Malawi's health sector strategic goals. The purpose of this study was to investigate patients' experience with primary care and to identify associated patients' sociodemographic, healthcare and health characteristics.MethodsThis was a cross sectional survey using questionnaires administered in public primary care facilities in Neno district, Malawi. Data on patients' primary care experience and their sociodemographic, healthcare and health characteristics were collected through face to face interviews using a validated Malawian version of the primary care assessment tool (PCAT-Mw). Mean scores were derived for the following dimensions: first contact access, continuity of care, comprehensiveness, community orientation and total primary care. Linear regression models were used to assess association between primary care dimension scores and patients' characteristics.ResultsFrom 631 completed questionnaires, first contact access, relational continuity and comprehensiveness of services available scored below the defined minimum. Sex, geographical location, self-rated health status, duration of contact with facility and facility affiliation were associated with patients' experience with primary care. These factors explained 10.9% of the variance in total primary care scores; 25.2% in comprehensiveness of services available and 29.4% in first contact access.ConclusionThis paper presents results from the first use of the validated PCAT-Mw. The study provides a baseline indicating areas that need improvement. The results can also be used alongside clinical outcome studies to provide comprehensive evaluation of primary care performance in Malawi.

AB BackgroundVarious actions have been taken during the last decade to increase the number of organs from deceased donors available for transplantation in Switzerland. This study provides an overview on key figures of the Swiss deceased organ donation and transplant activity between 2008 and 2017. In addition, it puts the evolution of the Swiss donation program's efficiency in relation to the situation in the neighboring countries.MethodsThis study is an analysis of prospective registry data, covering the period from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2017. It includes all actual deceased organ donors (ADD) in Switzerland. Donor data were extracted from the Swiss Organ Allocation System. The donor conversion index (DCI) methodology and data was used for the comparison of donation program efficiency in Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Italy and France.ResultsDuring the study period there were 1116 ADD in Switzerland. The number of ADD per year increased from 91 in 2008 to 145 in 2017 (+59%). The reintroduction of the donation after cardiocirculatory death (DCD) program in 2011 resulted in the growth of annual percentages of DCD donors, reaching a maximum of 27% in 2017. The total number of organs transplanted from ADD was 3763 (3.41.5 transplants per donor on average). Of these, 48% were kidneys (n=1814), 24% livers (n=903), 12% lungs (n=445), 9% hearts (n=352) and 7% pancreata or pancreatic islets (n=249). The donation program efficiency assessment showed an increase of the Swiss DCI from 1.6% in 2008 to 2.7% in 2017 (+69%). The most prominent efficiency growth was observed between 2012 and 2017. Even though Swiss donation efficiency increased during the study period, it remained below the DCI of the French and Austrian donation programs.Conclusion Swiss donation activity and efficiency grew during the last decade. The increased donation efficiency suggests that measures implemented so far were effective. The lower efficiency of the Swiss donation program, compared to the French and Austrian programs, may likely be explained by the lower consent rate in Switzerland. This issue should be addressed in order to achieve the goal of more organs available for transplantation.

ID AREAS; CD4; TB
AB In developing countries, tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem and the leading cause of death among patients with HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus). Until 2001, the tuberculin skin test (TST) was the only available tool for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), but false-negative TST results are frequently reported. Recently, the interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) release assay (IGRA) has gained ground because it can detect the IFN-gamma secreted by circulating lymphocytes T cells when stimulated by specific TB antigens. However, the role of IGRA in the diagnosis of LTBI in HIV-infected patients has not been well established.
   This cross-sectional study compared the accuracy of TST (performed by the Mantoux method) and IGRA (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube, Cellestis, Carnegie, Australia) on the diagnosis of LTBI among patients with HIV. LTBI is defined by LTBI risk and at least one positive test (TST or IGRA), without clinical evidence of active TB. We also assessed the accuracy of TST and IGRA among HIV patients with high and low risk for LTBI.
   Among 90 HIV patients, 80 met the study criteria for LTBI, fifty-nine (73.7%) patients were TST positive, 21 (26.2%) were negative, whereas 75 patients (93.7%) were IGRA positive, and five (6.2%) were negative. TST showed poor agreement with the diagnosis of LTBI (Kappa: 0.384), while IGRA demonstrated good agreement (Kappa: 0.769). Among 69 patients with high risk and 21 with low risk for LTBI, TST was positive in 48 (69.5%) and 11 (52.4%), while IGRA was positive in 68 (98.5%) and 7 (33.3%) patients, respectively. There were no association between TST and the level of risk (P = 0,191). Conversely, we observed a strong association between the IGRA and risk for LTBI (p < 0.001).
   Compared to TST, IGRA positivity is consistent with the risk of TB infection and seems to be a better diagnostic tool for LTBI in HIV-infected patients.

AB Background
   QuantiFERON Gold Plus (Plus) assay has two approved methods for blood collection: direct in-tube (Plus direct) or the transfer of blood from a lithium heparin tube (Plus transfer). Currently, there is little data comparing the results of Plus and the QuantiFERON Gold In-Tube (Gold) based on blood collection.
   Methods
   In 2017, high risk healthcare workers undergoing annual tuberculosis infection screening at Houston Methodist Hospital, a private hospital in the Texas Medical Center (Houston, TX, U.S.A.) were consented and enrolled in a study comparing the Gold-in-tube (Gold), Plus direct in-tube, and Plus transfer assays. Blood was drawn concurrently for all 3 assays.
   Results
   Phlebotomy occurred on 300 consecutive, consented and enrolled participants in the study. The proportion of positive test results for the Gold, Plus direct and Plus transfer assays were 10% (29/300), 12% (35/299) and 17% (51/299), respectively. The agreement in the results of Gold versus Plus direct, Gold versus Plus transfer, and Plus direct versus Plus transfer was 91%, kappa (kappa) = 0.56; 91%, kappa = 0.59; and 85%, kappa = 0.37, respectively.
   Conclusions
   Among high risk healthcare workers in a low prevalence tuberculosis setting, the Gold Plus assay had a higher proportion of positive results than the Gold in-tube assay. The agreement between the Gold, Plus direct and Plus transfer assays was unexpectedly low for simultaneously obtained samples. Blood transfer using lithium heparin offers individual clinics and public health programs greater ability to customize protocols, but variability of results still exists.

AB The availability alongside growing awareness of medicine has led to increased self-treatment of minor ailments. Self-medication is where one 'self' diagnoses and prescribes over the counter medicines for treatment. The self-care movement has important policy implications, perceived to relieve the National Health Service (NHS) burden, increasing patient subsistence and freeing resources for more serious ailments. However, there has been little research exploring how self-medication behaviours vary between population groups due to a lack of available data. The aim of our study is to evaluate how high street retailer loyalty card data can help inform our understanding of how individuals self-medicate in England. Transaction level loyalty card data was acquired from a national high street retailer for England for 2012-2014. We calculated the proportion of loyalty card customers (n similar to 10 million) within Lower Super Output Areas who purchased the following medicines: 'coughs and colds', 'Hayfever', 'pain relief' and 'sun preps'. Machine learning was used to explore how 50 sociodemographic and health accessibility features were associated towards explaining purchasing of each product group. Random Forests are used as a baseline and Gradient Boosting as our final model. Our results showed that pain relief was the most common medicine purchased. There was little difference in purchasing behaviours by sex other than for sun preps. The gradient boosting models demonstrated that socioeconomic status of areas, as well as air pollution, were important predictors of each medicine. Our study adds to the self-medication literature through demonstrating the usefulness of loyalty card records for producing insights about how self-medication varies at the national level. Big data offer novel insights that add to and address issues that traditional studies are unable to consider. New forms of data through data linkage may offer opportunities to improve current public health decision making surrounding at risk population groups within self-medication behaviours.

ID SURFACE CLEANLINESS; ROOM; ENVIRONMENT
AB Environmental cleaning practice plays an important role in reducing microbial contamination in hospital surfaces and contributes to prevent Healthcare Associated Infections. Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) bioluminescence assay is a commonly used method for assessing environmental cleanliness on healthcare surfaces. This study tested the feasibility of using ATP-bioluminescence assay for evaluating the efficiency of cleaning procedures in the operating theatre settings, comparing the ATP-bioluminescence test with the traditional culture method.
   The surfaces of 10 operating rooms of two public hospitals (140 samples in total) were examined "at rest", in two moments of the same daily session: before the first scheduled operation (Pre), and before the second, after a clean environment was re-established (Post). Surface contamination was assessed using the cultural method to detect Total Viable Counts (TVC36A degrees C) and ATP-bioluminescence assay (RLU).
   The examined surfaces presented very low TVCs (geometric means: 1.8 CFU/plate; IC95%: 1.6-2.0), always compliant with the relative reference standards. No statistical correlation was found between ATP values and TVCs. However, considering the results in terms of general evaluation of hygienic quality of surfaces, the two methods were consistent in identifying the most contaminated areas (Hospital A > Hospital B; Pre > Post; most contaminated surfaces: scialytic lamp). Furthermore, the ATP mean values showed a progressive increase from surfaces with TVC = 0 to surfaces with TVC > 15 CFU/plate.
   Although not an alternative to cultural methods, the ATP-bioluminescence-assay can be a useful tool to measure the efficiency of cleaning procedures also in environments with very low microbial counts. Each health facility should identify appropriate reference values, depending on the devices used and on the basis of the analysis of the data collected through spatial and temporal sampling series. By providing a rapid feedback, the ATP-assay helps to increase the awareness of operators and allows immediate action to be taken in critical situations.

AB Successful treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is essential to reduce tuberculosis (TB) incidence rates in low-burden countries. This study measures treatment completion and determinants of non-completion of LTBI treatment in Norway in 2016.
   This prospective cohort study included all individuals notified with LTBI treatment to the Norwegian Surveillance System for Infectious Diseases (MSIS) in 2016. We obtained data from MSIS and from a standardized form that was sent to health care providers at the time of patient notification to MSIS. We determined completion rates. Pearson's chi squared test was used to study associations between pairs of categorical variables and separate crude and multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with treatment completion and adverse drug effects.
   We obtained information on treatment completion from 719 of the 726 individuals notified for LTBI treatment in 2016. Overall, 91% completed treatment. Treatment completion was highest in the foreign-born group [foreign-born, n = 562 (92%) vs Norwegian-born, n = 115 (85%), p = 0.007]. Treatment completion did not differ significantly between prescribed regimens (p = 0.124). Adverse events were the most common reason for incomplete treatment. We found no significant differences in adverse events when comparing weekly rifapentine (3RPH) with three months daily isoniazid and rifampicin (3RH). However, there were significantly fewer adverse events with 3RPH compared to other regimens (p = 0.037). Age over 35 years was significantly associated with adverse events irrespective of regimen (p = 0.024), whereas immunosuppression was not significantly associated with adverse events after adjusting for other variables (p = 0.306). Treatment under direct observation had a significant effect on treatment completion for foreign-born (multivariate Wald p-value = 0.017), but not for Norwegian-born (multivariate Wald p-value = 0.408) individuals.
   We report a very high treatment completion rate, especially among individuals from countries with high TB incidence. The follow-up from tuberculosis-coordinators and the frequent use of directly observed treatment probably contributes to this. Few severe adverse events were reported, even with increased age and in individuals that are more susceptible. While these results are promising, issues of cost-effectiveness and targeting treatment to individuals at highest risk of TB are important components of public health impact.

AB Schistosoma mansoni infection has been associated with increased risk of HIV transmission in African women. This association might be causal or mediated through shared socio-behavioural factors and associated co-infections. We tested the latter hypothesis in a cross-sectional pilot study in a cohort of women from a S. mansoni endemic region of Uganda. To validate the immunological effects of S. mansoni in this cohort, we additionally assessed known schistosomiasis biomarkers.
   HIV-uninfected non-pregnant adult women using public health services were tested for schistosomiasis using the urine circulating cathodic antigen test, followed by serology and Schistosoma spp.-specific PCR. Blood was obtained for herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 serology, eosinophil counts and cytokine analysis. Samples collected from the genitourinary tract were used to test for classical sexually transmitted infections (STI), for bacterial vaginosis and to assess recent sexual activity via prostate-specific antigen testing. Questionnaires were used to capture a range of socio-economic and behavioral characteristics.
   Among 58 participants, 33 (57%) had schistosomiasis, which was associated with elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-10 (0.32 vs. 0.19 pg/ml; p = 0.038) and a trend toward increased tumour necrosis factor (TNF) (1.73 vs. 1.42 pg/ml; p = 0.081). Eosinophil counts correlated with levels of both cytokines (r = 0.53, p = 0.001 and r = 0.38, p = 0.019, for IL-10 and TNF, respectively); the association of eosinophilia with schistosomiasis was not significant (OR = 2.538, p = 0.282). Further, schistosomiasis was associated with lower age (per-year OR = 0.910, p = 0.047), being unmarried (OR = 0.263, p = 0.030), less frequent hormonal contraceptive (HC) use (OR = 0.121, p = 0.002, dominated by long acting injectable contraceptives) and a trend to longer time since penile-vaginal sex (OR = 0.350, p = 0.064). All women infected by Chlamydia trachomatis (n = 5), were also positive for schistosomiasis (Fisher's exact p = 0.064).
   Intestinal schistosomiasis in adult women was associated with systemic immune alterations, suggesting that associations with immunological correlates of HIV susceptibility warrant further investigation. S. mansoni associations with socio-behavioral parameters and C. trachomatis, which may alter both genital immunity and HIV exposure and/or acquisition risk, means that future studies should carefully control for potential confounders. These findings have implications for the design and interpretation of clinical studies on the effects of schistosomiasis on HIV acquisition.

AB Smoking is a major risk factor for cancer and cardiovascular disease. However, mental stress leads to smoking in dental students. We believe that dentists, as health professionals, should set an example for the public. Therefore, this study determined the prevalence of and factors associated with regular smoking among Japanese dental students. We also surveyed their attitudes regarding smoking cessation and how to counsel smokers about quitting.
   We collected demographic and behavioral data from 453 students at Kyushu Dental University, and evaluated their mental health with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ 12). We also asked them nine questions related to their intentions to counsel smokers about quitting. A multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with smoking.
   Fifty-two (11.5%) of the dental students smoked. Univariate analyses indicated that male gender, higher academic year, greater number of times eating out per day, alcohol consumption, prevalence of skipping breakfast, poor health, and poor sleep habits were significantly associated with regular smoking. Regular smokers were less likely to have GHQ 12 scores a. On multivariate analysis, male gender (OR = 5.449, 95% CI = 1.851-16.040), sixth year students (OR = 21.971, 95% CI = 1.686-286.290), eating out two or more times a day (OR = 2.492, 95% CI = 1.165-5.331), drinking alcohol three or more times per week (OR = 9.484, 95% CI = 3.335-26.970), and GHQ 12 score a 4 (OR = 0.339, 95% CI = 0.136-0.845) were significantly associated with regular smoking. Overall, 50.1% of the non-smokers and 71.2% of the regular smokers responded that patients' chances of quitting smoking are not increased when a dentist advises them to quit.
   Regular smoking was strongly associated with male gender, higher academic year, alcohol consumption, and higher frequency of eating out per day. Mental health status among regular smokers was better than that among non-current smokers. Furthermore, we found that more than half of dental students have inadequate attitudes to advise their patients to quit smoking. It is necessary to develop educational programs regarding smoking for dental students.

Analyzing diagnostic and therapeutic procedures among patients with prostate cancer, using data from a population-based cancer registry, is essential for cancer surveillance and research strategies.
   Methods: This retrospective observational cohort study was based on data from the Martinique Cancer Registry. Records of 452 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2013 were retrieved from the registry. Data extracted were: socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, circumstances of diagnosis, PSA level at diagnosis, Gleason score and risk of disease progression. Stage at diagnosis and patterns of care among prostate cancer patients were analyzed.
   Results: Mean age at diagnosis was 67 +/- 8 years; 103 (28.5%) were symptomatic at diagnosis. Digital rectal exam was performed in 406 (93.8%). Clinical stage was available in 385 (85.2%); tumours were localized in 322/385 (83.6%). Overall, 17.9% were at low risk, 36.4% at intermediate and 31.9% at high risk; 13.8% were regional/metastatic cancers. Median PSA level at diagnosis was 8.16 ng/mL (range 1.4-5000 ng/mL). A total of 373 patients (82.5%) received at least one treatment, while 79 (17.5%) had active surveillance or watchful waiting. Among patients treated with more than one therapeutic strategy, the most frequent combination was external radiotherapy with androgen deprivation (n = 102, 22.6%).
   Conclusions: This study provides detailed data regarding the quality of diagnosis and management of patients with prostate cancer in Martinique. Providing data on prostate cancer is essential for the development of high-priority public health measures for the Caribbean.

ID HANTAVIRUS INFECTION; HEMORRHAGIC-FEVER; FRANCE; CHINA; RATS
AB Background: Seoul virus (SEOV) is a member of hantavirus family, which is transmitted to humans by Rattus rattus and Rattus norvegicus. Diagnosing SEOV infection is difficult because the clinical presentations are often undifferentiated with other viral or bacterial infections and assays to test antibodies seroconversion and RNA detection are not available in resource-limited setting like Indonesia.
   Case presentation: We report two confirmed cases of SEOV infection from Indonesia. Here, we illustrate the clinical presentations, hematology and biochemistry profiles, and outcomes of the two cases. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that SEOV sequences have highest homology to isolates obtained from rodents in Indonesia.
   Conclusions: This report highlights the importance of considering SEOV infection in febrile patients with lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevation of liver enzyme despite the absence of hemorrhagic manifestations and renal syndromes. The public health importance of rodent-borne diseases such as SEOV infection urges an integrated epidemiological surveillance both in humans and rodents in Indonesia.

AB This study set out to analyze questions about type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) from patients and the public. The aim was to better understand people's information needs by starting with what they do not know, discovered through their own questions, rather than starting with what we know about T2DM and subsequently finding ways to communicate that information to people affected by or at risk of the disease. One hundred and sixty-four questions were collected from 120 patients attending outpatient diabetes clinics and 300 questions from 100 members of the public through the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing platform. Twenty-three general and diabetes-specific topics and five phases of disease progression were identified; these were used to manually categorize the questions. Analyses were performed to determine which topics, if any, were significant predictors of a question's being asked by a patient or the public, and similarly for questions from a woman or a man. Further analysis identified the individual topics that were assigned significantly more often to the crowdsourced or clinic questions. These were Causes (CI: [-0.07, -0.03], p < .001), Risk Factors ([-0.08, -0.03], p < .001), Prevention ([-0.06, -0.02], p < .001), Diagnosis ([-0.05, -0.02], p < .001), and Distribution of a Disease in a Population ([-0.05,-0.01], p = .0016) for the crowdsourced questions and Treatment ([0.03, 0.01], p = .0019), Disease Complications ([0.02, 0.07], p < .001), and Psychosocial ([0.05, 0.1], p < .001) for the clinic questions. No highly significant gender-specific topics emerged in our study, but questions about Weight were more likely to come from women and Psychosocial questions from men. There were significantly more crowdsourced questions about the time Prior to any Diagnosis ([(-0.11, -0.04], p = .0013) and significantly more clinic questions about Health Maintenance and Prevention after diagnosis ([0.07. 0.17], p < .001). A descriptive analysis pointed to the value provided by the specificity of questions, their potential to disclose emotions behind questions, and the as-yet unrecognized information needs they can reveal. Large-scale collection of questions from patients across the spectrum of T2DM progression and from the public-a significant percentage of whom are likely to be as yet undiagnosed-is expected to yield further valuable insights.

   CONSUMPTION; SCIENCE; GENDER; HEALTH; TRENDS
AB It is important to estimate the duration-distance relation in cycle commuting in the general population since this enables analyses of the potential for various public health outcomes. Therefore, the aim is to estimate this relation in the Swedish adult population of 2015. For that purpose, the first step was to establishit for adult male and female cycle commuters in Greater Stockholm, Sweden. Whether or not the slopes of these relations needed to be altered in order to make them representative of the general population was evaluated by comparing the levels of maximal oxygen uptake in samples of commuter cyclists and the population. The measure used was the maximal oxygen uptake divided by both the body weight and a cycle weight of 18.5 kg. The body weights in the population samples were adjusted to mirror relevant levels in 2015. Age adjustments for the duration-distance relations were calculated on the basis of the maximal oxygen uptake in the population samples aged 20-65 years. The duration-distance relations of the cycle commuters were downscaled by about 24-28% to mirror levels in the general population. The empirical formula for the distance (D, km) was based on duration (T, minutes) speed (km/min) a correction factor from cycle commuter to the general population age adjustment (A, years). For the males in the general population the formula was: D = T . 20.76 km/h . 0.719 . (1.676-0.0147 . A). For females, the formula was: D = T . 16.14 km/h . 0.763 . (1.604-0.0129 A). These formulas, combined with distributions of route distances between home and work in the population, enable realistic evaluations of the potential for different public health outcomes through cycle commuting.

ID RISK-FACTORS
AB BackgroundMaternal mortality is a major public health challenge in Ethiopia. Uterine rupture is an obstetrical emergency with serious undesired complications for laboring mothers resulting in fatal maternal and neonatal outcomes. Uterine rupture has been contributing to high maternal morbidity and mortality. However, there is limited research on the factors and management outcomes of women with uterine rupture. Understanding the factors and management outcomes might delineate strategies to support survivors. Therefore the aim of this study is to assess the incidence and factors associated with outcomes of uterine rupture among laboring mothers at Felegehiwot Referral Hospital in Bahir Dar City, Northwest Ethiopia.MethodsThis is a cross sectional study with retrospective facility based data collection technique. All pregnant women who were managed for ruptured uterus at Felegehiwot referral hospital from September 11 2012 to August 30 2017 were included. The chart numbers of the women collected from operation theatre registers. Their case folders retrieved from the medical records room for analysis. Using structured check list, information on their sociodemography, booking status, clinical features at presentation and the place of attempted vaginal delivery was extracted. Data on the intraoperative findings, treatment, and associated complications and outcomes also collected. The collected data cleaned, coded and entered into EPI- Info version (7.1.2.0) and then exported in to SPSS Version 20.0 for analysis. Statistical comparison was done using chi square (X-2). Strength of association between the explanatory variables and outcome variables described using odds ratio at 95% CI and P value less than 0.05. The results presented in tables.ResultsWe studied 239 cases of uterine rupture in the 5years period. Mothers without previous cesarean delivery including eight primigravidas took 87% of the cases. From all study participants, 54 of mothers (22.6%) developed undesired outcomes whereas 185(77.4%) discharged without major sequel. More than half (56.9%) arrived in hypovolemic shock. Total abdominal hysterectomy was the commonest procedure accounting for 61.5%. Duration of surgery was less than 2h in 67.8% of the procedures. Anemia is the commonest complication (80.3%) followed by wound infection and VVF (11.7% each). There were 5 maternal deaths (2.1%). Mothers who had prolonged operation time (>2h) (AOR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.10, 4.63) were significantly associated with undesired maternal outcomes after management of uterine rupture.ConclusionIncidence of ruptured uterus and its complications were high in the study area. It reflects the need for improvement in obstetric care and strong collaboration with referring health facilities to ensure prompt referral and management.

AB BackgroundWords matter when describing people involved in the criminal justice system because language can have a significant impact upon health, wellbeing, and access to health information and services. However, terminology used in policies, programs, and research publications is often derogatory, stigmatizing, and dehumanizing.DiscussionIn response, health experts from Europe, the United States, and Australia recommend that healthcare professionals, researchers, and policy makers working with people in detention follow key principles that foster constructive and humanizing language. These principles include: engage people and respect their preferences; use stigma-free and accurate language; prioritize individuals over their characteristics; and cultivate self-awareness. The article offers examples of problematic terms to be avoided because they do not convey respect for incarcerated people and propose preferred wording which requires contextualization to local language, culture, and environment.ConclusionThe use of respectful and appropriate language is a cornerstone of reducing harm and suffering when working with people involved in the criminal justice system; the use of stigmatizing and dehumanizing language must therefore come to an end.

TI A stochastic simulation model to study respondent-driven recruitment
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SURVEILLANCE; POPULATIONS
AB Respondent-driven detection is a chain recruitment method used to sample contact persons of infected persons in order to enhance case finding. It starts with initial individuals, so-called seeds, who are invited for participation. Afterwards, seeds receive a fixed number of coupons to invite individuals with whom they had contact during a specific time period. Recruitees are then asked to do the same, resulting in successive waves of contact persons who are connected in one recruitment tree. However, often the majority of participants fail to invite others, or invitees do not accept an invitation, and recruitment stops after several waves. A mathematical model can help to analyse how various factors influence peer recruitment and to understand under which circumstances sustainable recruitment is possible. We implemented a stochastic simulation model, where parameters were suggested by empirical data from an online survey, to determine the thresholds for obtaining large recruitment trees and the number of waves needed to reach a steady state in the sample composition for individual characteristics. We also examined the relationship between mean and variance of the number of invitations sent out by participants and the probability of obtaining a large recruitment tree. Our main finding is that a situation where participants send out any number of coupons between one and the maximum number is more effective in reaching large recruitment trees, compared to a situation where the majority of participants does not send out any invitations and a smaller group sends out the maximum number of invitations. The presented model is a helpful tool that can assist public health professionals in preparing research and contact tracing using online respondent-driven detection. In particular, it can provide information on the required minimum number of successfully sent invitations to reach large recruitment trees, a certain sample composition or certain number of waves.

   REASSORTMENT; BURDEN
AB Influenza B virus-caused illness has recently been considered as an urgent public health problem due to substantial morbidity, mortality and life-threatening medical complications. In this study, we have reported the main characteristics of influenza B virus in Mongolia, including prevalence, lineages, suitability with vaccine strains and drug susceptibility against the virus. 15768 specimens were tested by qPCR for detecting influenza viruses. From positive specimens for influenza B virus, the clinical isolates were isolated using MDCK cells. Sequencing analysis, hemagglutination inhibition assay and Neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) drug susceptibility testing were performed for the clinical isolates. Influenza B virus was around in 3.46% of the samples in Mongolia, and B/Victoria clade-1A and B/Yamagata clade-3 lineages were predominant. Importantly, it was confirmed that the lineages corresponded to the vaccine strains. Moreover, drug susceptibility tests revealed that some Mongolian clinical isolates showed reduced susceptibility to antiviral agents. Interestingly, G104R was identified as a novel mutation, which might have a significant role in drug resistance of the virus. These results describe the characteristics of influenza B viruses that have caused respiratory illness in the population of Mongolia between 2013 and 2017.

TI HIV cascade of care in Greece: Useful insights from additional stages
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CONTINUUM; PROGRAM; COUNTRY; RISK
AB Background
   Aiming to eliminate HIV infection, UNAIDS has set a global "90-90-90" target by 2020. We sought to construct a 6-stages HIV Cascade of Care (CoC) in Greece, overall and by risk group, to assess risk-group and stage-specific progress in achieving the UNAIDS target.
   Patients and methods
   Combining data from the HIV/AIDS surveillance system and a population-based HIV cohort study, the CoC included: i) number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) by end of 2013; ii) proportion of PLHIV ever diagnosed; iii) proportion of diagnosed linked-to-care iv) proportion of linked-to-care ever initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART); v) proportion of treated who retained-in-care vi) proportion of those retained-in-care who were virally suppressed (<200 copies/mL) at their last visit (01/07/2012-31/12/2013).
   Results
   In 2013, 14147 PLHIV were in Greece. Overall, proportions of each stage in the cascade were: 78.4% diagnosed; 86% linked-to-care; 78.5% initiated ART; 86.4% retained-in-care, nd 87.1% virally suppressed. Totally, 42.6% of all PLHIV were virally suppressed. The percentage diagnosed was lower among heterosexual men and women (heterosexuals) than in MSM (men who have sex with men) or PWID (people who inject drugs). Most MSM were linked to care (97.2% of diagnosed) while a substantial proportion of PWID were not (80.8% of diagnosed). Once treated, PWID remained in care in similar proportions to MSM. Unlike PWID, a high proportion of the retained in care MSM and heterosexuals achieved viral suppression.
   Conclusions
   At the end of 2013, we identified gaps in the HIV CoC in Greece, which differed across risk groups. Targeted interventions are critical in optimizing early diagnosis and timely linkage. A 6-stage CoC, stratified by risk group, can inform strategic public health planning in improving HIV treatment outcomes.

AB Background
   Bhutan, a small land-locked country in the eastern Himalayas has been undergoing an epidemiological and nutritional transition in the last two decades. The objective of this paper was to determine the prevalence and explore the risk factors of self-reported diabetes among Bhutanese adults.
   Methods
   We conducted a secondary data analysis among adults 18 years and older Bhutanese using the data from the National Health Survey 2012 (NHS, 2012) of Bhutan. The self-reported information on risk factors was obtained using standard protocols of the WHO STEPwise approach to Surveillance. The outcome of interest was self-reported diabetes on medication. Adjusted and unadjusted logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factor of diabetes.
   Results
   A total of 31,066 participants aged 18 years and older were included for the analysis. The prevalence of self-reported hypertension was 1.8% (491). Risk factors for diabetes were: age groups: 35-44 years adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.82 (95% Cl, 1.07, 7.41), 45-54 years AOR = 6.02 (95% Cl, 2.29, 15.83), 55-64 year AOR = 15.7 (95% Cl 5.93, 41.55) and >65 years AOR = 19.60 (95% Cl, 6.93, 55.71); high school and diploma/certificate education AOR = 2.57, (95% CI 1.62, 4.07) and AOR = 3.92 (95% CI 1.70, 9.07); and urban dwellers AOR = 2.37, (95% 1.58, 3.57); hypertension AOR = 3.3, (95% Cl 2.47, 4.41); and fruit servings of 1-3 per week AOR = 1.63 (95% Cl 1.15,2.31).
   Conclusion
   The number of Bhutanese adults with diabetes and co-morbidities associated with it is likely to increase with the ageing of the population, nutrition transition, and high rural-urban migration in the near future. This calls for an urgent need to implement strategies to prevent diabetes in the Bhutanese population targeting risk factors including healthy lifestyle with increased physical activities and reduced smoking. At the same time treating other chronic morbidities including hypertension.

AB Background: As increasing numbers of dengue vaccines and therapeutics are in clinical development, standardized consensus clinical endpoint definitions are urgently needed to assess the efficacy of different interventions with respect to disease severity. We aimed to convene dengue experts representing various sectors and dengue endemic areas to review the literature and propose clinical endpoint definitions for moderate and severe disease based on the framework provided by the WHO 2009 classification.
   Methods: The endpoints were first proposed and discussed in a structured expert consultation. After that, the Delphi method was carried out to assess the usefulness, validity and feasibility of the standardized clinical disease endpoints for interventional dengue research.
   Results: Most respondents (>80%) agreed there is a need for both standardized clinical endpoints and operationalization of severe endpoints. Most respondents (67%) felt there is utility for moderate severity endpoints, but cited challenges in their development. Hospitalization as a moderate endpoint of disease severity or measure of public health impact was deemed to be useful by only 47% of respondents, but 89% felt it could bring about supplemental information if carefully contextualized according to data collection setting. Over half of the respondents favored alignment of the standard endpoints with the WHO guidelines (58%), but cautioned that the endpoints could have ramifications for public health practice. In terms of data granularity of the endpoints, there was a slight preference for a categorical vs numeric system (e.g. 1-10) (47% vs 34%), and 74% of respondents suggested validating the endpoints using large prospective data sets.
   Conclusion: The structured consensus-building process was successful taking into account the history of the debate around potential endpoints for severe dengue. There is clear support for the development of standardized endpoints for interventional clinical research and the need for subsequent validation with prospective data sets. Challenges include the complexity of developing moderate disease research endpoints for dengue.

   PIGS; PROCYANIDINS; ANTIOXIDANT; METABOLISM
AB Background: Because antibiotic use in livestock is assumed to contribute to the emerging public health crisis of antibiotic resistance, alternatives are required. Phytogenic additives are extensively studied due to their antibiotic properties. Components of Agrimonia species have been reported as candidate antimicrobials that possess antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. We studied the impact of Agrimonia procera (AP) on the growth of selected strains of gut bacteria, the effect of AP on the mRNA abundance of genes involved in inflammation and bacterial defense in a colon carcinoma cell line, the effect of AP in piglets challenged with lipopolysaccharides, and the effect of AP on the growth performance of healthy piglets.
   Results: The in vitro growth rate of different bacteria strains was negatively affected by AP, especially in Pediococcus pentosaceus and all tested E. coli strains. Stimulation of Caco-2 cells with TNF alpha resulted in elevated mRNA expression of CXCL1, IL-8 and GPX2. After pretreatment of cells with AP, stimulation of Caco-2 cells with TNF alpha still resulted in elevated mRNA expression of CXCL1 and IL-8 at all measured points in time. However, mRNA expression in AP-pretreated cells was lower after 6h and 24h. In addition, expression of DEFB1 and GPX2 was significantly elevated after TNF alpha stimulation. In vivo, application of lipopolysaccharides induced significantly increased animal body temperatures. Piglets pretreated with AP prior to lipopolysaccharide application showed a faster and larger increase in body temperature than controls. In addition, piglets pretreated with AP appeared to release more TNF alpha than controls. In healthy piglets, AP treatment had no impact on growth performance parameters. Fecal dry matter and total plasma antioxidant capacity tended to be higher in piglets treated with AP than in control piglets (P = 0.055 and P = 0.087, respectively).
   Conclusions: AP has antimicrobial effects in vitro and stimulated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in Caco-2 cells. The additive had no effect on growth in healthy piglets but increased the immune response in LPS-treated animals. In addition, AP appeared to have antioxidative effects in vivo. Therefore, AP merits testing as a future alternative to antibiotics in animal husbandry.

AB BackgroundTyphoid fever remains a public health concern in developing countries especially among the poor who live in informal settlements devoid of proper sanitation and clean water supply. In addition antimicrobial resistance poses a major challenge in management of the disease. This study assessed the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S. Typhi) isolated from typhoid fever cases (2004-2007).MethodsA cross sectional study was conducted on 144 archived S. Typhi isolates (2004-2007) tested against 11 antimicrobial agents by quality controlled disk diffusion technique. Isolates resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and cotrimoxazole were considered Multidrug resistant (MDR). Thirty MDR isolates were selected randomly and further tested using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) E-test.ResultsSixteen percent (23/144) of the isolates were susceptible to all the antibiotics tested while 68% were resistant to three or more of the 11 antibiotics tested. The isolates showed a high susceptibility to ceftriaxone (94%) and gentamicin (97%). A high percentage of resistance was observed for the conventional first-line antibiotics; ampicillin (72%), chloramphenicol (72%), and cotrimoxazole (70%). Sixty-nine percent of the isolates (100/144) showed reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. All the 30 (100%) isolates selected for MIC test were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. All except one of the 30 isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone while majority 21 (70%) recorded an intermediate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin with MIC of 0.12-0.5g/mL.ConclusionA large proportion of S. Typhi isolates were MDR and also showed reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Fluoroquinolone resistance is emerging and this may pose a challenge in treatment of typhoid in future. There is need for routine surveillance to monitor this phenotype in clinical settings.

AB Background: Snacking is a prevalent dietary behaviour among young adults, which could independently contribute to weight gain. Vending machines provide easy access to unhealthy snacks and beverages for young adults in universities. A voluntary front-of-pack labelling, named the Health Star Rating (HSR) system, has been implemented nationally by the Australian government as one strategy to address obesity since 2014. The primary aim of this study was to detect changes in the availability, pricing and advertising of healthy and unhealthy snacks and beverages in university vending machines after introduction of the HSR.
   Methods: The study design was two cross-sectional audits of university vending machines one before (in 2014) and another after (in 2017) the implementation of the HSR. Data collections were conducted in a large urban university (> 60,000 students). Every machine was assessed; the product's name, price, portion sizes and advertisements were recorded. Products were assigned an HSR to classify as healthy (>= 3.5 stars) or unhealthy (< 3.5 stars). To compare the differences of product availability between 2014 and 2017, the Chi-square test was used.
   Results: A total of 1836 and 2458 slots were audited in 2014 and 2017, respectively. The proportion of healthy snacks and beverages increased from 7 to 14% (p < 0.001) and 38 to 44% (p < 0.05) since 2014, respectively. The mean costs of unhealthy snacks and healthy beverages increased after three years. Healthy food and drink options were more expensive than unhealthy choices in 2017. Advertisements on vending machines for unhealthy foods and drinks remained prevalent.
   Conclusion: Only small changes have been observed in the availability of healthy snacks and beverages in vending machines since implementation of the HSR system. Policy directives are indicated to encourage further improvements.

AB A tuberculosis (TB) model that accounts for heterogeneity in host susceptibility to tuberculosis is proposed, with the aim of investigating the implications this may have for the effectiveness of public health interventions. The model examines the possibility that recovered individuals treated from active TB and individuals treated with preventive therapy acquire different levels of immunity. This contrasts with recent studies that assume the two cohorts acquire the same level of immunity, and therefore both groups are reinfected at the same rate. The analysis presented here examines the impact of this assumption when designing intervention strategies. Comparison of reinfection rates between cohorts treated with preventive therapy and recovered individuals who were previously treated for active TB provides important epidemiological insights. It is found that the reinfection rate of the cohort treated with preventive therapy is the one that plays the key role in qualitative changes in TB dynamics. By contrast, the reinfection rate of recovered individuals (previously treated from active TB) plays a minor role. Moreover, the study shows that preventive treatment of individuals during early latency is always beneficial regardless of the level of susceptibility to reinfection. Further, if patients have greater immunity following treatment for late latent infection, then treatment is again beneficial. However, if susceptibility increases following treatment for late latent infection, the effect of treatment depends on the epidemiological setting. That is: (i) in (very) low burden settings, the effect on reactivation predominates and the burden declines with treatment; (ii) in moderate to high burden settings the effect of reinfection predominates and burden increases with treatment. The effect is most dominant between the two reinfection thresholds, RT2 and RT1, respectively associated with individuals being treated with preventive therapy and individuals with untreated late latent TB infection.

AB BackgroundDiabetes remains a growing public health threat but evidence supports the role that pharmacists can play in improving diabetes medication use and outcomes. To improve the quality of care, the Veterans Health Administration has widely adopted care models that integrate clinical pharmacists, but more data are needed to interpret the impact of these services. Our objective was to assess clinical pharmacy services' impact on outcomes and oral antidiabetic medication (OAD) use among veterans with uncontrolled diabetes in the first year of therapy.MethodsThis was a retrospective cohort analysis using the Veterans Affairs (VA) Corporate Data Warehouse to identify the first diagnosis of and initiation of OAD therapy for uncomplicated, uncontrolled diabetes (A1C>7.0%) during 2002-2014. Receipt of clinical pharmacy services was identified using codes within VA electronic health records, and clinical values were obtained at or near the initial fill date and 365days later. Use of OADs was assessed by proportion of days covered (PDC) for one year following the first filled prescription. Veterans having received clinical pharmacy services were matched 1:1 to those having not seen a clinical pharmacist in the first year of therapy, and generalized linear models assessed changes and differences in outcomes.ResultsThe analysis included 5749 patients in each cohort. On average, patients saw a clinical pharmacist 2.5 times throughout the first year of OAD therapy. Adherence to OAD medications was higher in veterans having seen a pharmacist (84.3% vs. 82.4%, p<0.0001) and more such patients achieved a PDC of at least 80% (72.2% vs. 68.2%, p<0.0001). After one year of OAD therapy, mean change in hemoglobin A1C was greater among those receiving pharmacy services (-1.5% vs. -1.4%, p<0.0001).ConclusionPharmacist participation in diabetes patients' primary care positively affects the multifaceted needs of patients with this condition and comorbid chronic disease.

ID MEASLES
AB BackgroundMany asylum-seekers to Denmark come from war-torn countries where conflict and insufficient health care infrastructures disrupt vaccine programmes and result in very few children and their families presenting documentation of vaccinations on their arrival in asylum-centers. There is a need to explore how healthcare providers, in the absence of vaccine documentation, determine the vaccination needs of newly arrived refugee children.MethodsTo explore the tactics employed by healthcare professionals who screen and vaccinate asylum-seeking children in Denmark, we conducted semi-structured interviews between December 2015 and January 2016 with six healthcare professionals, including three doctors and three public health nurses. The interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed and subjected to a thematic network analysis.ResultsThe analysis revealed that healthcare providers adopt a number of tactics to ascertain children's immunization needs. They ask into the children's vaccination history through the use of qualified interpreters; consult WHO lists of immunization programmes worldwide; draw on tacit knowledge about country vaccination programmes; consider the background of parents; err on the side of caution and revaccinate.ConclusionsThis is one of the first studies to demonstrate the tactics employed by healthcare providers to ascertain the immunization needs of asylum-seeking children in a western receiving country. The findings suggest a need for clear guidance at a national level on how to determine the vaccination needs of asylum-seeking children, and an international effort to secure reliable immunization documentation for migrant populations, for example through virtual immunization records.

AB BackgroundAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing public health threat. Primary care physicians are important inducers of the overuse of antimicrobials and inappropriate prescribing. Augmented reality (AR) might provide a potential educational tool in health care. The aim of this study was to identify the need for education and expectations for AR-based education in the context of improving the rational use of antibiotics by primary care physicians in China.MethodsThe study used a qualitative approach based on face-to-face interviews with eleven physicians from three community health service centers and stations in China. We used a hybrid thematic analysis approach to analyze the interview data. A conceptual design framework, mobile augmented reality education (MARE), guided the work.ResultsThe physicians' personal prescription paradigms included problems regarding the way they diagnosed and chose treatments and prescriptions. Although the physicians mentioned that they should not treat patients with antibiotics without proof of a bacterial infection, in practice, they often did not wait for necessary test results before they prescribed antibiotics. It was also revealed that they often experienced difficulties when trying to convince patients to follow non-antibiotic treatments. Physicians' prescription of antibiotics was based on three different paths: if they thought there was a bacterial infection, if they thought preventing additional possible infections for the patient to be necessary; and if the patients requested antibiotics. The physicians expressed various learning needs for the rational use of antibiotics, and their expectations of an AR-based educational intervention included suggestions for contents, learning assets, learning environments and learning activities.ConclusionsThe results showed that the physicians were not only unfamiliar with national guidelines on the use of antibiotics and local AMR patterns but also had personal paradigm issues related to the physicians' decision making. Moreover, the physicians provided meaningful insights into and expectations for possible AR-based education on AMR. In this article, we demonstrate how to apply the MARE framework to analyze the needs of educational interventions for rational use of antibiotics.

TI Utilization of "prevention of mother-to-child transmission" of HIV
   services by adolescent and young mothers in Mulago Hospital, Uganda
SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
DE Adolescents; HIV; PMTCT; Utilization; Uganda
AB Background: Prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) has lowered the incidence of paediatric HIV globally. The risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (MTCT) remains high in Africa, where there is a high prevalence of pregnancy and poor health-seeking behaviour among young girls and women.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional, mixed-methods study, we evaluated the utilization of PMTCT services and associated factors among adolescent and young postpartum mothers aged 15 to 24 years at a public urban referral hospital in Uganda. Both HIV-positive and HIV-negative participants were recruited. Utilization of PMTCT services was defined as use of the PMTCT cascade of services including ever testing for HIV, receiving HIV test results; If tested negative, subsequent retesting up to 14 weeks; If tested positive, Antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) for the mother, ARVs and septrin prophylaxis for infant, safe delivery, safer infant feeding, early infant diagnosis within 6 weeks, and linkage to treatment and care. Optimal utilization of PMTCT was defined as being up to date with utilization of PMTCT services for reported HIV status at the time of being interviewed. The overall proportion of participants who optimally utilized PMTCT services was determined using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data was analyzed manually using the content thematic approach.
   Results: Of the 418 participants, 65 (15.5%) were HIV positive. Overall, only 126 of 418 participants (30.1%) had optimally utilized PMTCT services. However, utilization of PMTCT services was better among HIV positive mothers, with 83% (54/65) having utilized the services optimally, compared to only 20% (72/353) of the HIV negative mothers (OR 18.2 (95% CI; 9.0-36.7)). The benefits of knowing ones HIV status, health of the unborn child, and counseling and support from health workers and peers, were the major factors motivating adolescent and young mothers to utilize PMTCT services, while stigma, financial constraints, non-disclosure, and lack of partner and family support were key demotivating factors.
   Conclusion: Utilization of PMTCT services by these adolescent and young mothers was suboptimal. Special consideration should be given to adolescents and young women in the design of elimination of mother to child transmission (EMTCT) programs, to improve the utilization of PMTCT services.

AB BackgroundChlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia), the most commonly reported sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the Netherlands, can lead to severe reproductive complications. Reasons for the sustained chlamydia prevalence in young individuals, even in countries with chlamydia screening programs, might be the asymptomatic nature of chlamydia infections, and high reinfection rates after treatment. When individuals are unaware of their infection, preventive behaviour or health-care seeking behaviour mostly depends on psychological determinants, such as risk perception. Furthermore, behaviour change after a diagnosis might be vital to reduce reinfection rates. This makes the incorporation of psychological determinants and behaviour change in mathematical models estimating the impact of interventions on chlamydia transmission especially important. Therefore, quantitative real-life data to inform these models is needed.MethodsA longitudinal cohort study will be conducted to explore the link between psychological and behavioural determinants and chlamydia (re)infection among heterosexual STI clinic visitors aged 18-24years. Participants will be recruited at the STI clinics of the public health services of Amsterdam, Hollands Noorden, Kennemerland, and Twente. Participants are enrolled for a year, and questionnaires are administrated at four time points: baseline (before an STI consultation), three-week, six-month and at one-year follow-up. To be able to link psychological and behavioural determinants to (re)infections, participants will be tested for chlamydia at enrolment and at six-month follow-up. Data from the longitudinal cohort study will be used to develop mathematical models for curable STI incorporating these determinants to be able to better estimate the impact of interventions.DiscussionThis study will provide insights into the link between psychological and behavioural determinants, including short-term and long-term changes after diagnosis, and chlamydia (re)infections. Our mathematical model, informed by data from the longitudinal cohort study, will be able to estimate the impact of interventions on chlamydia prevalence, and identify and prioritise successful interventions for the future. These interventions could be implemented at STI clinics tailored to psychological and behavioural characteristics of individuals.Trial registrationDutch Trial Register NTR-6307.

AB BackgroundTo review literature on bicycling participation, as well as facilitators and barriers for bicycling in people with a lower limb amputation (LLA).MethodsPeer-reviewed, primary, full text, studies about bicycling in people with a LLA from midfoot level to hemipelvectomy were searched in Pubmed, Embase, Cinahl, Cochrane library, and Sportdiscus. No language or publication date restrictions were applied. Included full-text studies were assessed for methodological quality using the Effective Public Health Practice Project tool. Data were extracted, synthesized and reported following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review.ResultsIn total, 3144 papers were identified and 14 studies were included. The methodological quality of 13 studies was weak and 1 was moderate. Bicycling participation ranged from 4 to 48%. A shorter time span after LLA and a distal amputation were associated with a higher bicycling participation rate particularly for transportation. In people with a transtibial amputation, a correct prosthetic foot or crank length can reduce pedalling asymmetry during high-intensity bicycling. People with limitations in knee range of motion or skin abrasion can use a hinged crank arm or a low profile prosthetic socket respectively.ConclusionPeople with a LLA bicycled for transportation, recreation, sport and physical activity. Adaptation of prosthetic socket, pylon and foot as well as bicycle crank can affect pedalling work and force, range of motion, and aerodynamic drag. Because the suggestions from this review were drawn from evidences mostly associated to competition, prosthetists should carefully adapt the existing knowledge to clients who are recreational bicyclists.

AB BackgroundMenstruation is a universal aspect of human female reproductive life. Management of menstrual flow presents hygiene challenges to girls and women in low-income countries, especially when they first start their periods. As part of a project to improve menstrual hygiene management in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia, we explored the local understanding of menstruation through focus-group discussions and individual interviews.MethodsA detailed ethnographic survey of menstrual beliefs was carried out through 40 focus group discussions, 64 in-depth key informant interviews, and 16 individual case histories in the Tigray Region of northern Ethiopia. A total of 240 individuals participated in six types of focus groups (pre-menarchal girls, menstruating adolescents, married women of reproductive age, post-menopausal women, adolescent males, and married men). In-depth interviews were also carried out with 80 individuals, including Orthodox Christian priests, imams from the Muslim community, principals of primary and secondary schools, teachers and nurses, as well as menstruating schoolgirls and women. Audio data were transcribed and translated, then broken down into discrete codes using Atlas Ti software (version 7.5.4, Atlas.ti Scientific Software Development Mnbh, Berlin) and further grouped into related families and sub-families based on their content. The results were then synthesized to produce a cohesive narrative concerning menstruation in Tigray.ResultsRecurrent themes identified by participants included descriptions of the biology of menstruation (which were sometimes fanciful); the general unpreparedness of girls for menarche; cultural restrictions imposed by menstruation on females (particularly the stigma of ritual uncleanliness in both Christian and Muslim religious traditions); the prevalence and challenges of unmet menstrual hygiene needs at schools (including lack of access to sanitary pads and the absence of acceptable toilet/washing facilities); and the stigma and shame associated with menstrual hygiene accidents in public.ConclusionsChanges in the educational system in northern Ethiopia are required to improve student understanding of the biology of menstruation, to foster gender equity, to overcome the barriers to school attendance presented by poor menstrual hygiene management, and to create a society that is more understanding and more accepting of menstruation.

ID PATIENTS PERCEPTIONS; ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS; PATIENTS ATTITUDES;

AB BackgroundGeneric drug substitution is a public health policy challenge with high economic potential. Generic drugs are generally cheaper than brand-name drugs. Drugs are a significant part of the total health expenditure, especially in ambulatory care. We conducted a cross-sectional study with general practitioners in the Champagne-Ardenne region to determine physician-related factors and beliefs causing doctors to use the Not for Generic Substitution (NGS) mention.MethodsQuestionnaires were sent to General Practitioners (GPs) practicing in Champagne-Ardenne via 3 shipments, from January 2015 to May 2015. Prescriber characteristics and beliefs influencing the use of the NGS mention were assessed for frequent ( 5%) and less frequent (<5%) users of the NGS mention.ResultsFactors associated with above average NGS mention use in bivariate analysis included patient comorbidity, polypharmacy, a concern that generic and brand-name drugs are not bioequivalent and belief in higher efficacy of the brand name drug. The use of an e-prescribing system (EPS) and medical practice in rural areas appeared to be associated with lower use of NGS mention in bivariate analysis but not in multivariable analysis. In multivariable analysis, patient request was associated with a higher use of the NGS mention (NGS5%, adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR)=2.52; 95% CI=[1.46-4.35]; p=0.001), which was also linked to patient age over 65 (NGS5%, aOR=2.33; 95% CI=[1.03-5.30]; p=0.04). The NGS mention was often used for drugs where substitution is debated in the literature (thyroid hormones, antiepileptic drugs).ConclusionThis work highlights the involvement of the doctor-patient pair for the use of the NGS mention. Patient request was the major reason for using the NGS mention, even though it was not always endorsed by prescribers. Further studies are needed to assess patient views on generic drugs and drug substitution, accounting for their health status and socio-economic condition, to help improve the relevance of the information available to them.

AB BackgroundThis research program aims to investigate the implementation and effects of a theoretically promising prevention method. It is being developed in a European research collaboration within a Comenius project (2012-2015) between 6 European universities (in Malta, Italy, Greece, Croatia, Portugal and Sweden) with the purpose of enhancing European children's resilience.Methods/designRESCUR in Sweden consists in a RCT study of the Resilience Curriculum (RESCUR) that is taking place in Sweden 2017-2019. The study is being performed by Junis, IOGT-NTO's Junior Association, part of IOGT International, in conjunction with researchers at Goteborg, Umea and Stockholm universities, and is being funded by the Public Health Agency of Sweden.Around 1000 children of the ages 7-12 will, through their schools and associations, or via groups in social services, be acquainted with the material. Children will learn and practice mindfulness, storytelling, group discussions and much more, all designed to strengthen protective factors and increase their resilience. The program also involves parents, who are taking part in the work to reinforce children's protective factors.Based on the work with groups of children, an effectiveness study including children aged 7-12 in school classes, with randomized and controlled pre- and post-measurements, self-rating questionnaires and group observations is being performed. The program will also be implemented in a non-governmental organization and in groups in social services. The study also investigates forms of implementation.DiscussionThe design of the study will enable the researchers to answer five research questions by using a mixed-methods approach. Implementation will be studied, which is a necessary prerequisite for an effect study. Moreover, the research procedure has been tailored to the target group, with age-appropriate measures as well as multiple informants, which will produce high-quality data for analysis. A special ethical challenge is the study of young children, and efforts to give children a voice have been included in the program. This project is regarded as having good potential to benefit children in general, and particularly children in vulnerable positions.Trial registrationNational Institute of Health, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03655418.

ID INVOLVEMENT; BEHAVIOR; ANIMALS
AB Unauthorised feeding and touching of the animals by visitors to zoos and wildlife parks pose serious threats to the health of both animals and visitors alike. We tested the efficacy of four different "do not feed" signs designed to prevent zoo visitors from feeding a group of meerkats. Signs consisted of one of two different written messages and imagery of either a pair of watching human eyes, or meerkat pawprints as a control. Covert observation of visitor behaviour in the presence and absence of the signs was analysed. Visitors were significantly less likely to feed the meerkats when signs were present, than when they were absent. The effect of the signs was specific to the targeted behaviour in that feeding was reduced, but attempts to touch the meerkats increased with the presence of the signs. We did not find that the presence of watching eyes or the different wording on the signs affected the likelihood of visitors feeding the meerkats. We also examined factors that influenced the likelihood of visitors attending to the signs. We found that children were more likely to attend to signs than adults which has important implications for the design of such signs. Together our findings show that signs are effective in reducing the unwanted behaviours they target but may also result in displacement of these negative behaviours and that children are more likely to attend to these signs than adults.

In collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Thailand Department of Disease Control (DDC), Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) implemented the first Enhanced Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme (EGASP) in November 2015. Men presenting with urethritis at two clinical settings in Bangkok, Thailand (Bangrak Hospital [BH] and Silom Community Clinic @TropMed [SCC @TropMed]) provided demographic and behavioral information and had a urethral swab for Gram's stain and NG culture collected. The NG isolates were evaluated for antimicrobial susceptibility by the Epsilometer test (Etest) to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for cefixime (CFM), ceftriaxone (CRO), azithromycin (AZI), gentamicin (GEN), and ciprofloxacin (CIP). From November 2015-October 2016, 1,102 specimens were collected from 1,026 symptomatic men; 861 (78.1%) specimens were from BH and 241 (21.9%) specimens were from SCC @TropMed. Among the 1,102 specimens, 582 (52.8%) had intracellular Gram-negative diplococci and 591 (53.6%) had NG growth (i.e., NG infection); antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was performed on 590 (99.8%) NG isolates. Among all symptomatic men, 293 (28.6%) had sex with men only, 430 (41.9%) were ages 18-29 years, 349 (34.0%) had antibiotic use in the last 2 weeks, and 564 (55.0%) had NG infection. Among 23 men with repeat NG infection during this first year of surveillance, 20 (87.0%) were infected twice, 2 (8.7%) were infected three times, and 1 (4.3%) was infected more than four times. All NG isolates were susceptible to CFM and CRO, and had MICs below 2 mu g/mL for AZI and below 16 mu g/mL for GEN. Overall, 545 (92.4%) isolates were resistant to CIP. This surveillance activity assessed individual patients, and included demographic and behavioral data linked to laboratory data. The inclusion of both individual and laboratory information in EGASP could help identify possible persistent infection and NG treatment failures. Expansion of EGASP to additional global settings is critical to assess trends and risk factors for NG, and to monitor for the emergence of resistance.

DT Article
ID PFAPA SYNDROME; ULCERATION; REPLACEMENT; THERAPY
AB BackgroundLower serum vitamin D levels, a major public health problem worldwide, has been found to be associated with various infectious diseases, cancers, autoimmune and dermatological diseases. The serum levels of vitamin D in patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis are not clear. We investigated the vitamin D levels in patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis.MethodsForty patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis (Group I) and 70 healthy controls (Group II) included in the study. The characteristics of aphthous lesions (duration of disease and remission, frequency, diameter and number of the lesions) and demographics of the participants were recorded. Serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol levels were measured using electrochemiluminescence binding method.ResultsThere was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of age (p=0.06) and sex (p=0.4). Other baseline characteristics were not significantly different between the groups (p>0.05 for all). The mean diameter of aphthous lesions was 0.5 (0.4-0.6) cm and the mean number of lesions was 2.21.5. Serum vitamin D levels were 11 +/- 7.04ng/ml in Group I and 16.4 +/- 10.19ng/ml in Group II. Serum vitamin D levels were significantly lower in patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis (p=0.004).ConclusionsThe present study showed lower vitamin D levels in patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis compared to healthy controls.

AB BackgroundPulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) disease is of increasing public health concern in China. Information is limited regarding risk factors associated with this disease in China. The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology of pulmonary disease due to NTM in Southern China.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed the medical records of pulmonary NTM patients registered in the Guangzhou Chest Hospital with positive mycobacterial cultures during 2013-2016. We described sex, age, residence, treatment history, laboratory examination results and comorbidities of pulmonary NTM patients.ResultsAmong the 607 NTM cases, the most prevalent species were Mycobacterium avium complex (44.5%), Mycobacterium abscessus complex (40.5%), Mycobacterium kansasii (10.0%) and Mycobacterium fortuitum (2.8%). The male:female ratio was significantly lower among patients infected with rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) than among those with slowly growing mycobacteria (SGM). The risk of developing SGM disease significantly increased with advancing age. In addition, pulmonary RGM diseases were more common in migrant population than resident population. Notably, patients with pulmonary RGM diseases were significantly more likely to have bronchiectasis underlying noted than those with SGM diseases. No significant difference was observed in in vitro drug susceptibility among NTM species.ConclusionOur data illustrate that the M. avium complex is the most predominant causative agent of pulmonary NTM disease in Southern China. Female, migrant population, the presence of bronchiectasis are independent risk factors for pulmonary diseases due to RGM. In addition, the prevalence of SGM increases significantly with advancing age.

TI Probabilistic approach for assessing cancer risk due to benzo[a] pyrene
   in barbecued meat: Informing advice for population groups

LA English
DT Article

AB Background
   Consumption of meat prepared by barbecuing is associated with risk of cancer due to formation of carcinogenic compounds including benzo[a] pyrene (BaP). Assessment of a population's risk of disease and people's individual probability of disease given specific consumer attributes may direct food safety strategies to where impact on public health is largest. The aim of this study was to propose a model that estimates the risk of cancer caused by exposure to BaP from barbecued meat in Denmark, and to estimate the probability of developing cancer in subgroups of the population given different barbecuing frequencies.
   Methods
   We developed probabilistic models applying two dimensional Monte Carlo simulation to take into account the variation in exposure given age and sex and in the individuals' sensitivity to develop cancer after exposure to BaP, and the uncertainty in the dose response model. We used the Danish dietary consumption survey, monitoring data of chemical concentrations, data on consumer behavior of frequency of barbecuing, and animal dose response data.
   Findings
   We estimated an average extra lifetime risk of cancer due to BaP from barbecued meat of 6.8 x 10(-5) (95% uncertainty interval 2.6 x 10(-7) - 7.0 x 10(-4)) in the Danish population. This corresponds to approximately one to 4,074 extra cancer cases over a lifetime, reflecting wide uncertainty. The impact per barbecuing event on the risk of cancer for men and women of low body weight was higher compared to higher bodyweight. However, the difference due to sex and bodyweight between subgroups are dwarfed by the uncertainty.
   Interpretation
   This study proposes a model that can be applied to other substances and routes of exposure, and allows for deriving the change in risk following a specific change in behaviour. The presented methodology can serve as a valuable tool for risk management, allowing for the formulation of behaviour advice targeted to specific sub-groups in the population.

TI Risk factors associated with prolonged hospital length-of-stay: 18-year
   retrospective study of hospitalizations in a tertiary healthcare center
   in Mexico
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MORTALITY; SURGERY; COMPLICATIONS
AB Background
   Hospital length-of-Stay has been traditionally used as a surrogate to evaluate healthcare efficiency, as well as hospital resource utilization. Prolonged Length-of-stay (PLOS) is associated with increased mortality and other poor outcomes. Additionally, these patients represent a significant economic problem on public health systems and their families. We sought to describe and compare characteristics of patients with Normal hospital Length-of-Stay (NLOS) and PLOS to identify sociodemographic and disease-specific factors associated with PLOS in a tertiary care institution that attends adults with complicated diseases from all over Mexico.
   Materials and methods
   We conducted a retrospective analysis of hospital discharges from January 2000-December 2017 using institutional databases of medical records. We compared NLOS and PLOS using descriptive and inferential statistics. PLOS were defined as those above the 95th percentile of length of hospitalization.
   Results
   We analyzed 85,904 hospitalizations (1,069,875 bed-days), of which 4,427 (5.1%) were PLOS (247,428 bed-days, 23.1% of total bed-days). Hematological neoplasms were the most common discharge diagnosis and surgery of the small bowel was the most common type of surgery. Younger age, male gender, a lower physician-to-patient ratio, emergency and weekend admissions, surgery, the number of comorbidities, residence outside Mexico City and lower socioeconomic status were associated with PLOS. Bone marrow transplant (OR 18.39 [95% CI 12.50-27.05, p<0.001), complex infectious diseases such as systemic mycoses and parasitoses (OR 4.65 [95% CI 3.40-6.63, p<0.001), and complex abdominal diseases such as intestinal fistula (OR 2.57 [95% CI 1.98-3.32) had the greatest risk for PLOS. Risk of mortality in patients with PLOS increased more than threefold (3.7% vs 13.3%, p<0.001).
   Conclusions
   We report some key sociodemographic and disease-specific differences in patients with PLOS. These could serve to develop a specific model of directed hospital healthcare for patients identified as in risk of PLOS.

AB BackgroundWith 1 in 4 Canadian preschoolers considered overweight or obese, identifying risk factors for excess weight gain and developing effective interventions aimed at promoting healthy weights and related behaviours among young children have become key public health priorities. Despite the need for this research, engaging and maintaining participation is a critical challenge for long-term, family-based studies. The aim of this study is to describe the implementation and evaluation of a parent-only advisory council designed to engage participants in the implementation and evaluation of a longitudinal, family-based obesity prevention intervention.MethodsA Family Advisory Council (n=14 parents, 70% mothers, 64% white), was established to engage participant stakeholders in decisions related to research protocols and strategies to engage and sustain family participation. Using a mixed methods approach, including a participant survey and focus group, we examined the council members' perceptions of their role and the impact this novel integrated Knowledge Translation (iKT) strategy had on the Guelph Family Health Study (GFHS), a longitudinal family-based study.ResultsAll members of the Family Advisory Council felt the topics discussed were appropriate, felt that their opinions were valued and that their suggestions have had an impact and direct benefit on the GFHS. The addition of the Family Advisory Council led to changes in study protocol (i.e. creation of more detailed intervention emails, creation of kid-friendly accelerometer bands) that may have contributed to the high retention rate of the GFHS (95% at 6-month follow-up).ConclusionsEngaging parents as research partners in family-based research studies may be an effective way to increase participant engagement and study retention.

AB BackgroundIn 2014 the Danish Government introduced a wide-ranging school reform that applies to all public schools in Denmark. The reform involves changes in several aspects of the school structure and content. In a physical activity promotion perspective, a distinctive feature of the school reform is that it has become mandatory to integrate an average of 45min of daily physical activity in the regular school day. The overarching objective of the PHASAR study is to evaluate the implementation and effect of this ambitious policy-driven physical activity promotion initiative on physical activity and overweight. This paper describes in detail the study protocol.MethodsThe evaluation is divided into a quantitative effect evaluation and a combined quantitative and qualitative process evaluation. A total of 31 schools are enrolled in the PHASAR study including more than 2,000 school-aged children. Objectively measured physical activity data are obtained in the PHASAR study in 2017/18 and compared to repeated cross sectional data collected in four historical school-based studies from 1998 to 2012. Body mass index data from 2012 to 2018 will be collected from The Child Database, which includes repeated cross-sectional assessments on approximately 100,000 children annually. In the absence of a control group, interrupted time-series analysis will be used to evaluate pre- and post-reform physical activity and body mass index levels and trends. A characterization of the school environment for physical activity promotion on a political, environmental, organizational and individual level and school implementation processes will be conducted to evaluate the implementation process. Data will be collected using interviews, surveys, document analyses and observations.DiscussionThe PHASAR study is a rare opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of a nation-wide policy-driven school-based physical activity promotion initiative. The use of objectively measured pre- and post-reform physical activity and body mass index data combined with a characterization of the school implementation processes for physical activity promotion will provide a comprehensive source to evaluate the school reform. The study findings have the potential to influence national and international policy makers, health professionals and school staff.

AB Background
   Low birth weight (LBW), an important risk factor for early childhood mortality and morbidity, is a major public health concern in developing countries including Cambodia. This study examined the prevalence of LBW across provinces in Cambodia and changes over time, and identified the factors associated with such condition.
   Methods
   We used children datasets from Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey (CDHS) 2010 and 2014. There were 3,522 children and 4,991 children in both surveys. Maps illustrating provincial variation in LBW prevalence were constructed. Then, multivariate analyses were conducted to assess factors independently associated with LBW in CDHS 2014.
   Results
   LBW prevalence remained stable between 2010 and 2014, at around 7.0% 95% CI: 5.8-8.1). all institutional births, but within significant variation across provinces. Factors independently associated with LBW included mother's no education compared with those whose mothers had secondary or higher education (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.0-2.6), babies born to mothers with < 4 antenatal care (ANC) visits during the pregnancy compared with those whose mothers had at least 4 ANC visits (AOR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.5-2.8). Also, first-born babies were at greater risk of LBW compared with second-born babies (AOR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0-2.0).
   Conclusion
   The study points to key sub-populations at greater risk and regions where LBW is particularly prevalent. Programs should target provinces where LBW prevalence remains high. Illiterate women, especially those pregnant for the first time should be the program priority. The current national program policy, which recommends that pregnant women have >= 4 ANC visits during pregnancy should be further reinforced and implemented. Program design should consider ways to communicate the importance of making the recommended number of ANC visits among women with no formal education.

   SEVERITY
AB Background
   Anemia in pregnancy is a major public health concern worldwide, especially in developing countries. Thus, there is a need of having current information and local data on the prevalence of anemia and associated factors during pregnancy to help inform preventive programmes. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of anemia and associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care at Debre Markos Referral Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia.
   Methods
   An institution based cross-sectional study was conducted at Debre Markos Referral Hospital in July and August 2016. A total of 234 randomly-selected pregnant women took part in the study. Data on sociodemographic factors, environmental and sanitation factors, reproductive factors, and nutrition related characteristics were collected using a structured questionnaire. Hemoglobin level was determined using hematological analyzer (Cell Dyn 1800) machine. The stool sample was collected to identify intestinal parasitic infections. Statistical analysis was done using logistic regression. The p value of less than 0.05 at 95% confidence interval was considered statistically significant.
   Results
   The overall prevalence of anemia among pregnant women was 11.5% (95% CI: 8.2%14.9%). The result of multivariable analysis revealed that, coffee consumption [AOR = 2.91; 95% CI (1.63, 8.78)], and hookworm infection [AOR = 2.65; 95% CI (1.48, 4.72)] were factors significantly associated with anemia among pregnant women.
   Conclusion
   Anemia is of public health concern among pregnant women in the study area. All pregnant women coming to antenatal clinics should be screened and treated routinely for intestinal parasitic infection. Pregnant women should limit coffee consumption, and avoid drinking coffee with meals.

TI Exploring the behavioural drivers of veterinary surgeon antibiotic

ID ANTIMICROBIAL USAGE; PATTERNS
AB BackgroundMulti-drug resistant bacteria are an increasing concern in both human and veterinary medicine. Inappropriate prescribing and use of antibiotics within veterinary medicine may be a contributory factor to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The One Health' Initiative aims to work across species and environments to reduce AMR, however; little is currently known about the factors which influence antibiotic prescribing among veterinary surgeons in companion animal practice.This paper reports on qualitative data analysis of interviews with veterinary surgeons whose practice partially or wholly focuses on companion animals (N=16). The objective of the research was to explore the drivers of companion animal veterinary surgeons' antibiotic prescribing behaviours. The veterinary surgeons interviewed were all practising within the UK (England (n=4), Scotland (n=11), Northern Ireland (n=1)). A behavioural thematic analysis of the data was undertaken, which identified barriers and facilitators to specific prescribing-related behaviours.ResultsFive components of prescribing behaviours were identified: 1) confirming clinical need for antibiotics; 2) responding to clients; 3) confirming diagnosis; 4) determining dose, duration and type of antibiotic; and 5) preventing infection around surgery (with attendant appropriate and inappropriate antibiotic prescribing behaviours). Barriers to appropriate prescribing identified include: business, diagnostic, fear, habitual practice and pharmaceutical factors. Facilitators include: AMR awareness, infection prevention, professional learning and regulation and government factors.ConclusionThis paper uses a behavioural lens to examine drivers which are an influence on veterinary surgeons' prescribing behaviours. The paper contributes new understandings about factors which influence antibiotic prescribing behaviours among companion animal veterinary surgeons. This analysis provides evidence to inform future interventions, which are focused on changing prescribing behaviours, in order to address the pressing public health concern of AMR.

TI A survey on adolescent health information seeking behavior related to
   high-risk behaviors in a selected educational district in Isfahan
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Backgrounds
   The characteristics and conditions of growth and development have made adolescence one of the most vital and influential ages for prevention and health promotion, especially in the area of high-risk behaviors. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to determine adolescent health information seeking behavior related to high-risk behaviors in a selected educational district in Isfahan (Iran).
   Methodology
   The present study was of an applied type, which was conducted using the survey research method. The statistical population consisted of adolescent students at public schools in Isfahan (6519 subjects), and the sample size was determined to be 364 based on Cochran's formula. The sampling method was of a cluster sampling type, and the data collection tool was a researcher-made questionnaire. The validity of the questionnaire was approved by medical librarians, and using the Cronbach's alpha method, the reliability was obtained to be 0.85. SPSS 16 software was used for data analysis at two statistical levels: descriptive and inferential (independent t-test, one-sample t-test, chi-square, Pearson correlation coefficient and Mann-Whitney).
   Findings
   "Lack of mobility" was the most important health information need related to adolescent high-risk behaviors. The most important sources to obtain health information related to high-risk behaviors were "the Internet" with a mean score of 3.69 and "virtual social media" with a mean score of 3.49 out of 5. Adolescents had a positive attitude towards health information. The most important barriers to seeking health information were mentioned as follows: "difficulty in determining the quality of information found", "absence of appropriate information", and "concerns about the disclosure of their problems or illness to others". From the perspective of adolescents, the most important criterion for the evaluation of information quality was "the trueness and correctness of the information" and the need for health information related to high-risk behaviors was higher in girls than in boys.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Considering adolescents' positive attitude towards use of health information, it is necessary to put valid information at their disposal through different information resources, taking into account their level of information literacy. Accordingly, medical librarians' abilities are suggested to be used for the production, evaluation, and introduction of health-related reading materials in the field of high-risk behaviors in easy language and suitable for adolescents.

AB Background
   To investigate relationships among neonatal hypothyroidism, family income, and intellectual disability, as well as the combined effects of neonatal hypothyroidism and low family income on intellectual disability.
   Methods
   Data were extracted from the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort from 2002 to 2011. This retrospective study included 91,247 infants. The presence of intellectual disability was based on the disability evaluation system in Korea. Newborn hypothyroidism was identified from diagnosis and prescription codes. Family income was determined from average monthly insurance premiums. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios.
   Results
   Of the 91,247 infants, 208 were considered to have intellectual disability (29.18 cases per 100,000 person-year). The risk of intellectual disability was higher in infants with hypothyroidism than in those without hypothyroidism (hazard ratio = 5.28, P: < .0001). The risk of intellectual disability was higher in infants with low family income than in those with high family income (hazard ratio = 2.32, P. < .0001). The risk of intellectual disability was higher in infants with hypothyroidism and low family income than in those without hypothyroidism and with high family income (hazard ratio = 36.05, P. < .0001).
   Conclusions
   Neonatal hypothyroidism and low family income were associated with the risk of intellectual disability in Korea. Additionally, neonatal hypothyroidism and low family income significantly increased the risk of intellectual disability. Public health policymakers should consider providing additional resources for alleviating neonatal hypothyroidism among low-income families.

AB BackgroundThe field of acceptability of health services is emerging and growing in coherence. But there are gaps, including relatively little integration of elements of acceptability. This study attempted to analyse collectively three elements of acceptability namely: patient-provider, patient-service organisation and patient-community interactions.MethodsMixed methods were used to analyse secondary data collected as part of the Researching Equity in Access to Health Care (REACH) study of access to tuberculosis (TB) treatment, antiretroviral therapy (ART) and maternal health (MH) services in South Africa's public health sector.ResultsProvider acceptability was consistently high across all the three tracer services at 97.6% (ART), 96.6% (TB) and 96.4% (MH). Service acceptability was high only for TB tracer (70.1%). Community acceptability was high for both TB (83.6%) and MH (96.8%) tracers.ConclusionThrough mixed methods, this paper provides a nuanced view of acceptability of health services.

AB Background Despite reports that Southeast Asia has one of the highest prevalence for childhood exposure to second hand smoke (SHS), there are limited data on SHS exposure among schoolchildren in individual countries in the region, including Sri Lanka. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and correlates of SHS among schoolchildren in a Medical Officer of Health (MOH) region in the country.
   Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study, sampling from nice schools in one MOH region following a two-stage cluster sample design and probability proportionate to size sampling techniques. Data were obtained through a self-completed anonymous questionnaire on socio-demographic and health behaviour risk factors. We achieved an 89.5% response rate, corresponding to a total of 311 students in the final sample.
   Results The prevalence of exposure to SHS during the previous week was 17.6% at home and 25.7% in enclosed public places. There were no significant differences in exposure to SHS between sexes. Univariable analysis found that the presence of smokers at home and mother's unemployment status were significantly associated with a higher risk of exposure to SHS at home. These variables remained significant in multivariable analysis. Non-Sinhalese ethnicity and presence of smokers at home were significantly associated with exposure to SHS in public places, in both uni- and multivariable analysis. Unemployment status of mother was also found to be a significant determinant of exposure to SHS in public places in multivariable analysis.
   Conclusion Despite numerous antismoking activities and strong antismoking legislation, the prevalence of SHS exposure among schoolchildren is higher in enclosed public places than homes. The implementation and enforcement of antismoking legislation is imperative to tackle this and should be supported by the provision of education for schoolchildren and their families on the health risks of SHS. The high-risk groups identified here could be prioritised for preventive programmes.

AB Background The level of physical activity among individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with the disease severity and prognosis. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of self-reported walking at least 150min per week and the associated factors among the Spanish population with COPD.
   Methods Analyses were based on data drawn from the 2009 European Health Interview Survey in Spain (2009 EHIS). Twenty-two thousand one hundred eighty-eight subjects participated in the survey (response rate of 96.5%). Participants were classified according to international physical activity recommendations. The prevalence of walking among participants with and without COPD (40years old) was described. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to study the association of walking with socio-demographic and health outcome variables.
   Results Of the participants with COPD, 55.0% reached the minimum walking recommendations compared to 59.9% of the general population. The level of walking physical activity of the participants with COPD differed according to sex, age, educational level, area of residence, living as a couple, self-rated health status, mental health, body mass index and hospital admissions. In the multivariate analysis, being male, <65years old, living in an area with 50,000 inhabitants, no diagnosed depression or anxiety and self-reported good to very good health were factors significantly associated with walking 150min per week.
   Conclusions Sex, age, area of residence, mental disorders and self-rated health are associated with weekly walking time in the Spanish population with COPD.

TI Mastectomized women's perception of breast cancer early detection
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   A third of new cases of breast cancer could be detected early, which would prevent more serious consequences, such as mastectomy and death. Access to the subjectivity of mastectomized patients becomes relevant to elucidate failures in early detection of breast cancer and thus improve the cancer care network. Given that, the present study aimed to identify mastectomized women's perception of the quality of care provided by the cancer care network for the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer.
   Methods
   Qualitative study carried out at a public outpatient cancer center in the city of Fortaleza, Ceara, Northeastern Brazil, to analyze the perceptions of 26 women who had undergone mastectomy after breast cancer based on Symbolic Interactionism.
   Results
   The thematic analysis showed how women (re)structure their lives in the face of the structural and social aspects of coping with breast. Two essential themes emerged: "Contradictions regarding access to primary health care services and obstacles to the organization of SUS formal care network services" and "The informal and private health care network increase quality care coverage".
   Conclusions
   The absence of effective measures in Primary Health Care and patients' 'pilgrimage' in the formal health care network have delayed early detection breast cancer.

AB Viruses are important agents of emerging zoonoses and are a substantial public health issue. Among emerging viruses, an important group are arboviruses, which are characterized by being maintained in nature in cycles involving hematophagous arthropod vectors and a wide range of vertebrate hosts. Recently, bats have received increasing attention as an important source for the emergence of zoonoses and as possible viral reservoirs. Among the arboviruses, there are many representatives of the genera Fla vi virus and Alpha virus, which are responsible for important epidemics such as Dengue virus, Zika virus and Chikungunya virus. Due to the importance of analyzing potential viral reservoirs for zoonosis control and expanding our knowledge of bat viruses, this study aimed to investigate the presence of viruses of the Alpha virus and Fla vi virus genera in bats. We analyzed serum, liver, lungs and intestine from 103 bats sampled in northeast and southern Brazil via Nested-PCR and the hemagglutination inhibition test. All samples tested in this study were negative for arboviruses, suggesting that no active or past infection was present in the captured bats. These data indicate that the bats examined herein probably do not constitute a reservoir for these viruses in the studied areas. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of bats as reservoirs and sources of infection of these viral zoonoses.

AB Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a huge public health, development and human rights issue worldwide. Despite the fact that working women in patriarchal contexts commonly report higher level of IPV, literature on this subject is still scanty. This paper assessed the magnitude of different types of IPV against female garment workers and identified its correlates using cross-sectional survey data collected during September-December, 2016 from 800 female garment workers randomly selected from lists provided by eight garment factories in and around Dhaka, Bangladesh. The results reveal high levels of IPV experienced by the workers (physical = 34%; sexual = 43%; economic = 35%, last 12 months). Logistic regression results were nuanced. While the worker's ability to mobilize resources in crises reduced IPV, her savings beyond a threshold increased its likelihood. Moreover, her ownership of jewellery/ large household assets increased the likelihood of IPV. Having moderately or highly controlling husband, substance abuse by husband and his involvement in extramarital sex predicted IPV. Although the worker's education up to 6 years or more was protective, education more than the husband increased the likelihood of IPV. Young age, having two or more children, experience of non-partner sexual violence and high acceptance of IPV increased the likelihood of IPV. Middle income group protected against IPV, while household food insecurity increased its likelihood. Work at a factory in the Export Processing Zone protected against IPV. The findings indicate that financial empowerment alone is not sufficient to protect the workers from IPV; interventions that combine gender empowerment training for workers in the context of better factory working conditions may be useful in reducing IPV; working with men is essential in this endeavour.

TI Using linked electronic health records to report healthcare-associated
   infections
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SURVEILLANCE
AB Background
   Reporting of strategic healthcare-associated infections (HCAls) to Public Health England is mandatory for all acute hospital trusts in England, via a web-based HCAI Data Capture System (HCAI-DCS).
   Aim
   Investigate the feasibility of automating the current, manual, HCAI reporting using linked electronic health records (linked-EHR), and assess its level of accuracy.
   Methods
   All data previously submitted through the HCAI-DCS by the Oxford University Hospitals infection control (IC) team for methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, MSSA), Clostridium difficile, and Escherichia coli, through March 2017 were downloaded and compared to outputs created from linked-EHR, with detailed comparisons between 2013-2017.
   Findings
   Total MRSA, MSSA, E. coli and C. difficile cases entered by the IC team vs linked-EHR were 428 vs 432, 795 vs 816, 2454 vs 2450 and 3365 vs 3393 respectively. From 2013-2017, most discrepancies (32/37 (86%)) were likely due to IC recording errors. Patient and specimen identifiers were completed for >98% of cases by both methods, with very high agreement (>97%). Fields relating to the patient at the time the specimen was taken were complete to a similarly high level (>99% IC, >97% linked-EHR), and agreement was fairly good (>80%) except for the main and treatment specialties (57% and 54% respectively) and the patient category (55%). Optional, organism-specific data-fields were less complete, by both methods. Where comparisons were possible, agreement was reasonably high (mostly 70-90%).
   Conclusion
   Basic factual information, such as demographic data, is almost-certainly better automated, and many other data fields can potentially be populated successfully from linked-EHR. Manual data collection is time-consuming and inefficient; automated electronic data collection would leave healthcare professionals free to focus on clinical rather than administrative work.

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID INFECTIOUS-DISEASES; VIRUS TRANSMISSION; EMERGENCE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; RNA
AB Effective public health research and preparedness requires an accurate understanding of which virus species possess or are at risk of developing human transmissibility. Unfortunately, our ability to identify these viruses is limited by gaps in disease surveillance and an incomplete understanding of the process of viral adaptation. By fitting boosted regression trees to data on 224 human viruses and their associated traits, we developed a model that predicts the human transmission ability of zoonotic viruses with over 84% accuracy. This model identifies several viruses that may have an undocumented capacity for transmission between humans. Viral traits that predicted human transmissibility included infection of non-human primates, the absence of a lipid envelope, and detection in the human nervous system and respiratory tract. This predictive model can be used to prioritize high-risk viruses for future research and surveillance, and could inform an integrated early warning system for emerging infectious diseases.

AB BackgroundInjuries are becoming an increasingly important public health challenge globally, and are responsible for 9% of deaths. Beyond their impact on health and well-being, fatal and non-fatal injuries also affect social and economic development for individuals concerned. Kenya has limited data on the magnitude and factors associated with injuries. This study sought to determine the magnitude and risk factors for injuries in Kenya and to identify where the largest burden lies.MethodsA national population-based household survey was conducted from April-June 2015 among adults age 18-69years. A three-stage cluster sample design was used to select clusters, households and eligible individuals based on WHO guidelines. We estimated the prevalence of injuries, identified factors associated with injuries and the use of protective devices/practices among road users. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify potential factors associated with injuries.ResultsA total of 4484 adults were included in the study. Approximately 15% had injuries from the past 12months, 60.3% were males. Four percent of the respondents had been injured in a road traffic crash, 10.9% had experienced unintentional injuries other than road traffic injuries while 3.7% had been injured in violent incidents. Among drivers and passengers 12.5% reported always using a seatbelt and 8.1% of the drivers reported driving while drunk. The leading causes of injuries other than road traffic crashes were falls (47.6%) and cuts (34.0%). Males (p=0.001), age 18-29 (p<0.05) and smokers (p=0.001) were significantly more likely to be injured in a road traffic crash. A higher social economic status (p=0.001) was protective against other unintentional injuries while students had higher odds for such types of injuries. Heavy episodic drinking (p=0.001) and smoking (p<0.05) were associated with increased likelihood of occurrence of a violent injury.ConclusionsOur study found that male, heavy episodic drinkers, current smokers and students were associated with various injury types. Our study findings highlight the need to scale up interventions for injury prevention for specific injury mechanisms and target groups. There is need for sustained road safety mass media campaigns and strengthened enforcement on helmet wearing, seatbelt use and drink driving.

AB BackgroundPhysical inactivity accounts for more than 3 million deaths worldwide, and is implicated in causing 6% of coronary heart diseases, 7% of diabetes, and 10% of colon or breast cancer. Globally, research has shown that modifying four commonly shared risky behaviours, including poor nutrition, tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol, and physical inactivity, can reduce occurrence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Risk factor surveillance through population-based periodic surveys, has been identified as an effective strategy to inform public health interventions in NCD control. The stepwise approach to surveillance (STEPS) survey is one such initiative, and Kenya carried out its first survey in 2015. This study sought to describe the physical inactivity risk factors from the findings of the Kenya STEPS survey.MethodsThis study employed countrywide representative survey administered between April and June 2015. A three stage cluster sampling design was used to select clusters, households and eligible individuals. All adults between 18 and 69years in selected households were eligible. Data on demographic, behavioural, and biochemical characteristics were collected. Prevalence of physical inactivity was computed. Logistic regression used to explore factors associated with physical inactivity.ResultsA total of 4500 individuals consented to participate from eligible 6000 households. The mean age was 40.5 (39.9-41.1) years, with 51.3% of the respondents being female. Overall 346 (7.7%) of respondents were classified as physically inactive. Physical inactivity was associated with female gender, middle age (30-49years), and increasing level of education, increasing wealth index and low levels of High Density Lipoproteins (HDL).ConclusionA modest prevalence of physical inactivity slightly higher than in neighbouring countries was found in this study. Gender, age, education level and wealth index are evident areas that predict physical inactivity which can be focused on to develop programs that would work towards reducing physical inactivity among adults in Kenya.

AB BackgroundNon-communicable diseases and unintentional injuries are emerging public health problems in sub-Saharan Africa. These threats have multiple risk factors with complex interactions. Though some studies have explored the magnitude and distribution of those risk factors in many populations in Kenya, an exploration of segmentation of population at a national level by risk profile, which is crucial for a differentiated approach, is currently lacking. The aim of this study was to examine patterns of non-communicable disease and injury risk through the identification of clusters and investigation of correlates of those clusters among Kenyan adult population.MethodsWe used data from the 2015 STEPs survey of non-communicable disease risk factors conducted among 4484 adults aged between 18 and 69years in Kenya. A total of 12 risk factors for NCDs and 9 factors for injury were used as clustering variables. A K-medians Cluster Analysis was applied. We used matching as the measure of the similarity/dissimilarity among the clustering variables. While clusters were described using the risk factors, the predictors of the clustering were investigated using multinomial logistic regression.ResultsWe have identified five clusters for NCDs and four clusters for injury based on the risk profile of the population. The NCD risk clusters were labelled as cluster hypertensives, harmful users, the hopefuls, the obese, and the fat lovers. The injury risk clusters were labelled as helmet users, jaywalkers, the defiant and the compliant. Among the possible predictors of clustering, age, gender, education and wealth index came out as strong predictors of the cluster variables.ConclusionThis cluster analysis has identified important clusters of adult Kenyan population for non-communicable disease and injury risk profiles. Risk reduction interventions could consider these clusters as potential target in the development and segmentation of a differentiated approach.

AB BackgroundDiabetes Mellitus is one of the four major non-communicable diseases causing about 4 million deaths in 2017. By 2040, low income countries are projected to experience 92% increase in mortality due to diabetes. Undiagnosed diabetes poses a public health concern with costly public health implications especially in Africa. It is therefore crucial to examine the burden and risk factors for diabetes at national level to inform policy and national programs.MethodsData from the 2015 Kenya national STEPs survey of adults aged 18-69years were used. Pre-diabetes was defined as impaired fasting blood glucose level (6.1mmol/l to <7mmol/l) while diabetes was defined as impaired fasting blood glucose level7mmol/l. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the prevalence of pre-diabetes and diabetes and logistic regression was used to identify associated factors.ResultsComplete data for 4069 respondents (51% females), with 46% aged 18-29 and 61% in rural areas were analyzed. The age-standardized prevalence for pre-diabetes and diabetes were 3.1% (95% CI: 2.2, 4.0) and 2.4% (1.8, 3.0) respectively. Only 43.7% were aware of their glycemic condition, one in five of those who had diabetes had received treatment, and only 7% of those diagnosed with diabetes had their blood glucose under control. Primary education ((both incomplete (0.21, 95%CI 0.10-0.47) and complete (0.40, 95%CI 0.23-0.71)) were associated with lower odds of pre-diabetes. Older age (60-69years, AOR; 5.6, 95%CI 2.1-15.1) and raised blood pressure (2.8, 95% CI 1.5-5.0) were associated diabetes while overweight/obesity among women was associated with diabetes.ConclusionThe overall diabetes prevalence in Kenya is consistent with what has been reported in other sub-Saharan African countries. Of concern is the higher prevalence of pre-diabetes and undiagnosed diabetes that can progress to complications in the absence of interventions and the low diabetes awareness and control. This is the first nationally representative study to identify important groups at risk of pre-diabetes and diabetes that can be targeted for screening, health promotion and treatment.

AB BackgroundBurden of non-communicable diseases (NCD) is increasing worldwide. Risk factor surveillance informs public health interventions in NCD control. This study describes the dietary risk factors for NCD found in the Kenya STEPS survey, 2015.MethodsWe performed secondary analysis of the STEPS dataset to determine prevalence of dietary NCD risk factors and their determinants. New variables were created; high dietary salt, defined as addition of salt while eating or intake of processed foods high in salt and high dietary sugar, defined as intake of processed foods or drinks high in sugar in most meals or addition of sugar to beverages already with sugar, on a daily basis. We used the World Health Organization definition of minimum required intake of fruits and vegetables as consumption of less than five servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Perceptions ofrespondents on diet and health were also assessed. Accounting for complex survey sampling, we calculated prevalence of the various dietary modifiable determinants and adjusted odds ratios (AOR) to identify factors independently associated with dietary NCD risk factors.ResultsOf the 4484 individuals surveyed; mean age was 40.5years (39.9-41.1years), 60%were female. Prevalence of high reported dietary salt intake was 18.3% (95% CI 17.2%, 19.5%) and sugar13.7% (95% CI 11.7-15.8%). Awareness of health risk from dietary salt was 88% and 91% for dietary sugar.Approximately 56% of the respondents were implementing strategies to reduce dietary saltand 54% were doing the same for dietarysugar.Only 6.0% (95% CI 4.3-7.6%) of the respondents reported intake of a minimum of five servings of both fruits and vegetables daily. Unhealthy diet was associated with being male (AOR 1.33, 95% CI 1.04, 1.70,), age below 46years (AOR 1.78, 95% CI 1.42, 2.12) and being a student (AOR 15.6, 95% CI 2.44, 99.39).ConclusionDietary riskcommunication should be targeted to males and people under 45years of age, especially students. Further research is necessary to understand the knowledge: practice mismatch on unhealthy diets.

AB BackgroundCervical cancer is a major public health concern in Kenya. It is the leading cause of cancer morbidity and mortality among women. Although screening is an effective prevention method, uptake is low among eligible women. Little is known about predictors of cervical cancer screening uptake. This study explored relationship between uptake of cervical cancer screening, socio-demographic, behavioral and biological risk factors.MethodsNested case-control study within STEPS survey, a population-based cross-sectional household survey conducted between April and June 2015.Cases were women who had undergone cervical cancer screening and controls were unscreened women. Study participants were women eligible for cervical cancer screening (30-49years). Variables included socio-demographic; behavioral risk factors such as physical activity, tobacco and alcohol use diet and biological factors like diabetes and hypertension. Outcome of interest was cervical cancer screening. Data analysis was done using STATA version 14. Logistic regression model was used to assess relationship between cervical cancer screening and socio-demographic, behavioral and biological risk factors.ResultsOf 1180 women interviewed, 16.4% (n=194) had been screened for cervical cancer. Of unscreened women (n=986), 67.9% were aware of cervical cancer screening. Higher screening rates were observed in more educated women (25.2%), highest income quintile (29.6%) and living in urban areas (23%) than in women with no formal education (3.2%), poorest (3.6%) and living in rural areas (13.8%). Younger women (35-39) and those with low High-density lipoprotein (HDL) were less likely to be screened [OR=0.56; 95% CI=(0.34, 0.93); p-value=0.025] and [OR=0.51; 95% CI=(0.29, 0.91); p=value 0.023] respectively. Self-employed women, those in the fourth wealth quintile, binge drinkers, high sugar consumption and insufficient physical activity were more likely to be screened [OR 2.55 (1.12, 5.81) p value 0.026], [OR 3.56 (1.37, 9.28) p value 0.009], [OR 5.94 (1.52, 23.15) p value 0.010], [OR 2.99 (1.51, 5.89) p value 0.002] and [OR 2.79 (1.37, 5.68) p value 0.005] respectively.ConclusionUptake of cervical cancer screening is low despite high awareness. Strategies to improve cervical cancer screening in Kenya should be implemented with messages targeting persons with both risky and non-risky lifestyles especially younger women with no formal education living in rural areas.

In Africa, around one in five adults smoke tobacco. The 2014 Kenya Global Adult Tobacco Survey reported that 2.5 million adults use tobacco products. The objective of our study was to describe patterns and determinants of tobacco use from the 2015 Kenya STEPS survey, including use of smokeless tobacco products and the more novel e-cigarettes.MethodsThe WHO STEPwise approach to surveillance (STEPS) was completed in Kenya between April and June 2015. Logistic regression analyses was used to assess factors affecting prevalence and frequency of tobacco use. Sociodemographic variables associated with tobacco use were considered: age, sex, level of education, wealth quintile, and residence. The relationship with alcohol as an intervening risk factor was also assessed. Our main outcomes of interest were current tobacco use, daily tobacco use and use of smokeless tobacco products.ResultsOf 4484 respondents, 605 (13.5%) reported being current tobacco users. Most active tobacco users were male (n=507/605, 83.8%). Three out of four tobacco users (n=468/605, 77.4%) reported being less than 50years old, with the average start age being 21 (20.6, 95% CI 19.3-21.8) and the average quit age 27 (27.2, 95% CI 25.8-28.6). Most tobacco users had only ever attended up to primary school (n=434/605, 71.7%). Men had nearly seven times higher odds of being tobacco users as compared to women (OR 7.63, 95% CI 5.63-10.33). Alcohol use had a positive effect on tobacco use. Finally, less than ten respondents reported having used e-cigarettes.ConclusionThe 2015 Kenya WHO STEPS provided primary data on the status of tobacco use in the country and other leading NCD risk factors, such as alcohol, and associated diseases. Our findings highlight key target populations for tobacco cessation efforts: young people, men, those with lower levels of education, and alcohol consumers. Further data is needed on the use of smokeless tobacco, and its impact on smoked tobacco products, as well as on the novel use of e-cigarettes.

AB BackgroundRecent regulatory changes in the system by which premises are licensed to sell alcohol, have given health representatives a formal role in the process in England and Scotland. The degree to which local public health teams engage with this process varies by locality in both nations, which have different licensing regimes. This study aims to critically assess the impact on alcohol-related harms- and mechanisms- of public health stakeholders' engagement in alcohol premises licensing from 2012 to 2018, comparing local areas with differing types and intensities of engagement, and examining practice in Scotland and England.MethodsThe study will recruit 20 local authority areas where public health stakeholders have actively engaged with the alcohol premises licensing system (the intervention') and match them to a group of 20 lower activity areas using genetic matching. Four work packages are included: (1) Structured interviews and documentary analysis will examine the type and level of intervention activity from 2012 to 2018, creating a novel composite measure of the intensity of such activity and willassess the local licensing system and potential confounding activities over the same period. In-depth interviews with public health, licensing, police and others will explore perceived mechanisms of change, acceptability, and impact. (2) Using longitudinal growth models and time series analyses, the study will evaluate the impact of high and low levels of activity on alcohol-related harms using routine data from baseline 2009 to 2018. (3) Intervention costs, estimated National Health Service cost savings and health gains will be evaluated using the Sheffield Alcohol Policy Model to estimate impact on alcohol consumption and health inequalities. (4) The study will engage public health teams to create a new theory of change for public health involvement in the licensing process using our data. We will share findings with local, national and international stakeholders.DiscussionThis interdisciplinary study examines, for the first time, whether and how public health stakeholders' involvement in alcohol licensing impacts on alcohol harms. Using mixed methods and drawing on complex systems thinking, it will make an important contribution to an expanding literature evaluating interventions not suited to traditional epidemiological research.

AB Background
   The resistance problem of dengue vectors to different classes of insecticides that are used for public health has raised concerns about vector control programmes. Hence, the discovery of alternative compounds that would enhance existing tools is important for overcoming the resistance problem of using insecticides in vectors and ensuring a chemical-free environment. The larvicidal effects of Azolla pinnata extracts by using two different extraction methods with methanol solvent against Aedes in early 4th instar larvae was conducted.
   Methods
   The fresh Azolla pinnata plant from Kuala Krai, Kelantan, Malaysia was used for crude extraction using Soxhlet and maceration methods. Then, the chemical composition of extracts and its structure were identified using GCMS-QP2010 Ultra (Shimadzu). Next, following the WHO procedures for larval bioassays, the extracts were used to evaluate the early 4th instar larvae of Aedes mosquito vectors.
   Results
   The larvicidal activity of Azolla pinnata plant extracts evidently affected the early 4th instar larvae of Aedes aegypti mosquito vectors. The Soxhlet extraction method had the highest larvicidal effect against Ae. aegypti early 4th instar larvae, with LC50 and LC95 values of 1093 and 1343 mg/L, respectively. Meanwhile, the maceration extraction compounds were recorded with the LC50 and LC95 values of 1280 and 1520 mg/L, respectively. The larvae bioassay test for Ae. albopictus showed closely similar values in its Soxhlet extraction, with LC50 and LC95 values of 1035 and 1524 mg/L, compared with the maceration extraction LC50 and LC95 values of 1037 and 1579 mg/L, respectively. The non-target organism test on guppy fish, Poecilia reticulata, showed no mortalities and posed no toxic effects. The chemical composition of the Azolla pinnata plant extract has been found and characterized as having 18 active compounds for the Soxhlet method and 15 active compounds for the maceration method.
   Conclusions
   Our findings showed that the crude extract of A. pinnata bioactive molecules are effective and have the potential to be developed as biolarvicides for Aedes mosquito vector control. This study recommends future research on the use of active ingredients isolated from A. pinnata extracts and their evaluation against larvicidal activity of Aedes in small-scale field trials for environmentally safe botanical insecticide invention.

TI Prevalence of underweight, overweight and obesity and their associated
   risk factors in Nepalese adults: Data from a Nationwide Survey, 2016
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES; INDIA; URBAN; MORTALITY; INDEX
AB Introduction
   Over the past few decades, the total population of Nepal has increased substantially with rapid urbanization, changing lifestyle and disease patterns. There is anecdotal evidence that non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and associated risk factors are becoming key public health challenges. Using nationally representative survey data, we estimated the prevalence of underweight, overweight and obesity among Nepalese adults and explored socio-demographic factors associated with these conditions.
   Materials and methods
   We used the Nepal Demographic Health Survey 2016 data. Sample selection was based on stratified two-stage cluster sampling in rural areas and three stages in urban areas. Weight and height were measured in all adult women and men. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using Asian specific BMI cut-points.
   Results
   A total of 13,542 adults aged 18 years and above (women 58.19%) had their weight and height measured. The mean (+/- SD) age was 40.63 +/- 16.82 years (men 42.75 +/- 17.27, women 39.15 +/- 16.34); 41.13% had no formal education and 60.97% lived in urban areas. Overall, 17.27% (95% CI: 16.64-17.91) were underweight; 31.16% (95% CI: 30.38-31.94) overweight/obese. The prevalence of both underweight (women 18.30% and men 15.83%, p<0.001) and overweight/obesity (women 32.87% and men 28.77%, p<0.001) was higher among women. The older adults (>= 65 years) (aOR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.92-2.99, p<0.001) and the adults of poorest wealth quintile (aOR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.62-2.59, p<0.001) were more likely to be underweight. The younger age adults (36-45 years) (aOR: 3.05, 95% CI: 2.61-3.57, p<0.001) and women (aOR: 1.53, 95% CI 1.39-1.68, p<0.001) were more likely to be overweight or obese. Also, all adults were twice likely to overweight/obese (p<0.001). No significant difference was observed for overweight/obesity by ecological regions and place of residence (urban vs. rural).
   Conclusion
   These findings confirm co-existence of double burden of underweight and overweight/obesity among Nepalese adults. These conditions are associated with increased risk of developing NCDs. Therefore, effective public health intervention approaches emphasizing improved primary health care systems for NCDs prevention and care and using multi-sectoral approach, is essential.

TI Health-motivated taxes on red and processed meat: A modelling study on
   optimal tax levels and associated health impacts
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID COMPARATIVE RISK-ASSESSMENT; DIABETES-MELLITUS; ECONOMIC BURDEN;
   CONSUMPTION; MORTALITY; METAANALYSIS; DISEASE; FOOD; STROKE
AB Background
   The consumption of red and processed meat has been associated with increased mortality from chronic diseases, and as a result, it has been classified by the World Health Organization as carcinogenic (processed meat) and probably carcinogenic (red meat) to humans. One policy response is to regulate red and processed meat consumption similar to other carcinogens and foods of public health concerns. Here we describe a market-based approach of taxing red and processed meat according to its health impacts.
   Methods
   We calculated economically optimal tax levels for 149 world regions that would account for (internalize) the health costs associated with ill-health from red and processed meat consumption, and we used a coupled modelling framework to estimate the impacts of optimal taxation on consumption, health costs, and non-communicable disease mortality. Health impacts were estimated using a global comparative risk assessment framework, and economic responses were estimated using international data on health costs, prices, and price elasticities.
   Findings
   The health-related costs to society attributable to red and processed meat consumption in 2020 amounted to USD 285 billion (sensitivity intervals based on epidemiological uncertainty (SI), 93-431), three quarters of which were due to processed meat consumption. Under optimal taxation, prices for processed meat increased by 25% on average, ranging from 1% in low-income countries to over 100% in high-income countries, and prices for red meat increased by 4%, ranging from 0.2% to over 20%. Consumption of processed meat decreased by 16% on average, ranging from 1% to 25%, whilst red meat consumption remained stable as substitution for processed meat compensated price-related reductions. The number of deaths attributable to red and processed meat consumption decreased by 9% (222,000; SI, 38,000-357,000), and attributable health costs decreased by 14% (USD 41 billion; SI, 10-57) globally, in each case with greatest reductions in high and middle-income countries.
   Interpretation
   Including the social health cost of red and processed meat consumption in the price of red and processed meat could lead to significant health and environmental benefits, in particular in high and middle-income countries. The optimal tax levels estimated in this study are context-specific and can complement the simple rules of thumb currently used for setting health-motivated tax levels.

AB BackgroundConsidering the targeted general practitioner-centred healthcare in Germany, general practitioners (GPs) are in the best possible position to increase awareness of all sorts of dementia, an age-related syndrome with rising relevance in the future. In Germany, a doubling of the number of cases from 1.55 million up to 3 million in 2050 is predicted. Diagnostics can be challenging, especially among patients with a migration background. Complicating factors include: Language-based diagnostic tools, cultural differences in handling the syndrome and its underlying diseases as well as a differing use of the healthcare system. Because of missing research in this field in Germany, the type, frequency and intensity of barriers as well as the way GPs cope with them is unknown. That is why it's crucial to focus research on diagnostics in total and especially among this population group.MethodsA cross-sectional study among a random sample of 1000 general practitioners in Germany is conducted in October 2017. A self-administered standardized questionnaire was developed, evaluated and send to the GP practices. A response rate of 30% is expected with one reminder letter. Descriptive statistics as well as, depending on the results, multivariable analyses will be executed. Based on these results and the stated needs, a cluster-randomized intervention study will be constructed to improve healthcare.DiscussionThis study is the first in Germany focusing on how dementia diagnostics in general practice is performed, what problems occur, especially because of a migration background of patients, and how GPs cope with them. Depending on the results, it should emphasize the necessity of dementia diagnostics to be adjusted to the needs of the rising amount of people with a migration background (22.5% in Germany, 2016) like concluded from international studies.Trial registrationGerman Clinical Trials Register: DRKS00012503, date of registration: 05.09.2017.

AB Background
   Heart failure (HF), is a major public health issue globally. Echocardiography is cost-effective in the diagnosis in expert hands. This study was conducted to estimate the usefulness of Aortic Root Systolic Excursion (ARSE) as a simple and accurate measure to estimate Left Ventricular (LV) function.
   Methods
   This was a cross-sectional echocardiographic study among adults aged >= 18 years, with or without heart failure, in sinus rhythm, and with no LV out-let obstruction. We studied the correlations of ARSE with some selected indices of LV Systolic Functions. We determined optimal cut-offs of ARSE in detecting LV dysfunction. We generated a simple regression equation to best estimate LV ejection fraction according to the modified Simpson method.
   Results
   Overall 213 echocardiograms were included from 106 males (49.8%), with mean age of the participants being 52.4 (SD: 18.3) years. The rate of LV systolic dysfunction was highest with Teicholz method (17.4%) and lowest with MAPSE method (5.2%). ARSE correlated with the LV functions. This was highest for the Simpson method (r = 0.619, p<0.001), and lowest for the ITV method (r = 0.319, p<0.001). Optimal cut-offs to detect LV systolic dysfunction was approximate to 6.6 mm. For an LV ejection fraction < 55%, the sensitivity was 82.9%, and the specificity was 97.2%, with an AUROC of 91.6%.The logarithmic regression equation was best in predicting LV ejection fraction (AUC: 60.2%), followed by the power model (AUC: 56.7%), and the linear model (AUC: 53.6%).
   Conclusion
   ARSE correlated well with LV systolic function. The cut-off <= 6.5 mm suggest LV systolic dysfunction. LV Ejection Fraction was best estimated with the generic equation: LVEF (%) = 29 x In [ARSE].

AB BackgroundHospitals increasingly make decisions about early development of and investment in innovative medical technologies (IMTs), but at present often without an early assessment of their potential to ensure selection of the most promising candidates for further development. This paper explores how early assessment is carried out in different health organisations and then discusses relevant learning points for hospitals.MethodsA qualitative study design with a structured interview guide covering four themes was used. Content analyses of interview notes were performed covering four predetermined themes: context, basis for decision-making, process and structure, and perceptions. A fifth theme, handling cognitive bias, was identified during data analysis.ResultsA total of 11 organisations participated; eight from the private health industry and three public hospitals. The interviews identified four areas in which early assessment is performed in similar manner across the studied organisations and four areas where differences exist between public hospitals and private organisations. Public hospitals indicate a lower degree of formalised early assessment and less satisfaction with how early assessment is performed, compared to private organisations. Based on the above findings, two learning points may carry promise for hospitals. First, having dedicated prioritising committees for IMTs making stop/go decisions. This committee is separate from the IMT development processes and involved staff. Secondly, the committee should base decisions on a transparent early assessment decision-support tool, which include a broad set of domains, is iterative, describes uncertainty, and minimise cognitive biases.ConclusionsSimilarities and differences in the way early assessment is done in different health organisations were identified. These findings suggest promising learning points for the development of an early assessment model for hospitals.

TI Understanding drivers of domestic public expenditure on reproductive,

   ecological study
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article

   health; Child health
AB BackgroundPeru has increased substantially its domestic public expenditure in maternal and child health. Peruvian departments are heterogeneous in contextual and geographic factors, underlining the importance of disaggregated expenditure analysis up to the district level. We aimed to assess possible district level factors influencing public expenditure on reproductive, maternal, neonatal and child health (RMNCH) in Peru.MethodsWe performed an ecological study in 24 departments, with specific RMNCH expenditure indicators as outcomes, and covariates of different hierarchical dimensions as predictors. To account for the influence of variables included in the different dimensions over time and across departments, we chose a stepwise multilevel mixed-effects regression model, with department-year as the unit of analysis.ResultsPublic expenditure increased in all departments, particularly for maternal-neonatal and child health activities, with a different pace across departments. The multilevel analysis did not reveal consistently influential factors, except for previous year expenditure on reproductive and maternal-neonatal health. Our findings may be explained by a combination of inertial expenditure, a results-based budgeting approach to increase expenditure efficiency and effectiveness, and by a mixed-effects decentralization process. Sample size, interactions and collinearity cannot be ruled out completely.ConclusionsPublic district-level RMNCH expenditure has increased remarkably in Peru. Evidence on underlying factors influencing such trends warrants further research, most likely through a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches.

AB BackgroundWhile many studies have explored the concept and correlates of stigma towards individuals with mental illness, few have investigated the role of personality in this process. In the current study, we firstly examined the relationship between personality and stigma towards mental illness; and then explored the moderating effects of personality traits on the relationship between contact experience/s and stigma.MethodsParticipants were recruited from public medical (N=502) and nursing schools (N=500) from April to September 2016 in Singapore for this cross-sectional survey, and they were randomly assigned to a vignette describing one of the following mental disorders: major depressive disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, alcohol abuse, schizophrenia, and dementia. Stigma was measured by the Personal and Perceived scales of the Depression Stigma Scale' and the Social Distance Scale'. These scales together had a 3-factor structure based on a previous national study in Singapore, namely weak-not-sick', dangerous/unpredictable' and social distance'. Personality was measured by the 20-item short form of the International Personality Item Pool-five factor model measure.ResultsRegression suggested agreeableness and openness to experience were negatively associated with all three domains of stigma. Weak-not-sick' and extraversion were positively associated; and social distance' was positively associated with higher scores on conscientiousness and neuroticism. Both close- and non-close contact were associated with more positive attitudes towards mental illness among the participants. Openness to experience moderated the relationships of close contact experience with weak-not-sick' and dangerous/unpredictable', but in different directions. The association between close contact and social distance' were moderated by agreeableness.ConclusionsUnlike non-close contact experience, close contact with people with mental illness worked differently on stigma for individuals with different personality traits. Future studies are needed to further explore the underlying mechanisms for such differences.

ID ANTIBIOTICS; ATTITUDES
AB Background
   Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a threat to global health. To increase public awareness about AMR and encourage the prudent use of antimicrobials is one of the goals of the National Action Plan in Japan.
   Methods
   A nationwide online cross-sectional survey was conducted to evaluate the existing knowledge and perception of AMR in Japan, based on the Antimicrobial Resistance Eurobarometer Survey. Participants included Japanese adults aged 20-69 years, who were not medical professionals.
   Results
   Among a total of 3,390 participants, about half had taken antibiotics over the past 12 months, and majority of them obtained the antimicrobials from healthcare institutions for the common cold. While 11.7% of the participants kept leftover antibiotics, 23.6% of them have adjusted doses by themselves. About 10% of the participants have requested antibiotics from their doctors, and nearly 30% of them preferred doctors who prescribed antibiotics when had a cold. The common informational sources were TV news and newspapers, and more than 40% of the participants reported receiving some information over the past year. However, approximately 80% of the participants did not know that antibiotics do not kill viruses and that antibiotics are ineffective against cold and flu.
   Conclusion
   Not many Japanese have adequate information about antimicrobials and AMR, and many have taken antimicrobials inappropriately. Greater educational interventions are, therefore, necessary to increase public awareness and develop effective countermeasures against AMR in Japan.

AB Respiratory tract infections and invasive disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in high-risk groups are a major global health problem. Available human vaccines have reduced immunogenicity and low immunological memory in these populations, as well as high cost as a public health strategy in poor communities. In addition, no single pneumococcal protein antigen has been able to elicit protection comparable to that achieved using protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccines. In this context, chimeric pneumococcal proteins raise as potential good vaccine candidates because of their simplicity of production and reduced cost. The aim of this work was to study whether the nasal immunization of infant mice with the recombinant chimeric pneumococcal protein (PSFP) was able to improve resistance to S. pneumoniae, and whether the immunomodulatory strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505 or its cell wall (CW1505) could be used as effective mucosal adjuvants. Our results showed that the nasal immunization with PSPF improved pneumococcal-specific IgA and IgG levels in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL), reduced lung bacterial counts, and avoided dissemination of pneumococci into the blood. Of interest, immunization with PSPF elicited cross-protective immunity against different pneumococcal serotypes. It was also observed that the nasal immunization of infant mice with PSPF+CW1505 significantly increased the production of pneumococcal-specific IgA and IgG in BAL, as well as IgM and IgG in serum when compared with PSPF alone. PSPF+CW1505 immunization also improved the reduction of pneumococcal lung colonization and its dissemination in to the bloodstream when compared to PSPF alone. Our results suggest that immunization with PSPF together with the cell wall of the immunomodulatory strain L. rhamnosus CRL1505 as a mucosal adjuvant could be an interesting alternative to improve protection against pneumococcal infection in children.

AB BackgroundThe East African region is endemic with multiple zoonotic diseases and is one of the hotspots for emerging infectious zoonotic diseases with reported multiple outbreaks of epidemic diseases such as Ebola, Marburg and Rift Valley Fever. Here we present a systematic assessment of published research on zoonotic diseases in the region and thesis research in Kenya to understand the regional research focus and trends in publications, and estimate proportion of theses research transitioning to peer-reviewed journal publications.MethodsWe searched PubMed, Google Scholar and African Journals Online databases for publications on 36 zoonotic diseases identified to have occurred in the East Africa countries of Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda, for the period between 1920 and 2017. We searched libraries and queried online repositories for masters and PhD theses on these diseases produced between 1970 and 2016 in five universities and two research institutions in Kenya.ResultsWe identified 771 journal articles on 22, and 168 theses on 21 of the 36 zoonotic diseases investigated. Research on zoonotic diseases increased exponentially with the last 10years of our study period contributing more than half of all publications 460 (60%) and theses 102 (61%) retrieved. Endemic diseases were the most studied accounting for 656 (85%) and 150 (89%) of the publication and theses studies respectively, with publications on epidemic diseases associated with outbreaks reported in the region or elsewhere. Epidemiological studies were the most common study types but limited to cross-sectional studies while socio-economics were the least studied. Only 11% of the theses research transitioned to peer-review publications, taking an average of 2.5years from theses production to manuscript publication.ConclusionOur findings demonstrate increased attention to zoonotic diseases in East Africa but reveal the need to expand the scope, focus and quality of studies to adequately address the public health, social and economic threats posed by zoonoses.

AB BackgroundType 2 diabetes mellitus has become one of the most important public health concerns worldwide. Due to its high prevalence and morbidity, there is an avid necessity to find new therapies that slow the progression and promote the regression of the disease. Imatinib mesylate is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that binds to the Abelson tyrosine kinase and related proteins. It enhances -cell survival in response to toxins and pro-inflammatory cytokine. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of imatinib on fasting plasma glucose in subjects with normal fasting glucose, subjects with impaired fasting glucose and in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.MethodsWe identified 284 subjects diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia or gastrointestinal stromal tumors from the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran database. 106/284 subjects were treated with imatinib. We compared the effect of imatinib on fasting plasma glucose after 1 and 6months of treatment. We used ANOVA test of repeated samples to determine statistical significance in fasting plasma glucose before imatinib treatment and the follow-up. Statistical analysis was performed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences v22.ResultsWe included a total of 106 subjects: 76 with fasting plasma glucose concentrations <100mg/dL (normal FG), 19 subjects with fasting plasma glucose concentrations 100mg/dL (impaired fasting glucose), and 11 subjects with 126mg/dL (type 2 diabetes mellitus). We found a significant increase in fasting plasma glucose concentration in the normal fasting glucose group (p=0.048), and a significant decrease in fasting plasma glucose concentration in the type 2 diabetes mellitus group (p=0.042). In the impaired fasting glucose group, we also found a tendency towards a decrease in fasting plasma glucose (p=0.076). We identified 11 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, of whom, 7 (64%) had a reduction in their fasting plasma glucose concentrations after 6months. A significant glycosylated hemoglobin reduction (p=0.04) was observed.ConclusionSubjects with chronic myeloid leukemia or gastrointestinal stromal tumor with type 2 diabetes mellitus had a significant reduction in fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin at 1 and 6months while using imatinib.

AB BackgroundData-driven population segmentation analysis utilizes data analytics to divide a heterogeneous population into parsimonious and relatively homogenous groups with similar healthcare characteristics. It is a promising patient-centric analysis that enables effective integrated healthcare interventions specific for each segment. Although widely applied, there is no systematic review on the clinical application of data-driven population segmentation analysis.MethodsWe carried out a systematic literature search using PubMed, Embase and Web of Science following PRISMA criteria. We included English peer-reviewed articles that applied data-driven population segmentation analysis on empirical health data. We summarized the clinical settings in which segmentation analysis was applied, compared and contrasted strengths, limitations, and practical considerations of different segmentation methods, and assessed the segmentation outcome of all included studies. The studies were assessed by two independent reviewers.ResultsWe retrieved 14,514 articles and included 216 articles. Data-driven population segmentation analysis was widely used in different clinical contexts. 163 studies examined the general population while 53 focused on specific population with certain diseases or conditions, including psychological, oncological, respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal conditions. Variables used for segmentation in the studies are heterogeneous. Most studies (n=170) utilized secondary data in community settings (n=185). The most common segmentation method was latent class/profile/transition/growth analysis (n=96) followed by K-means cluster analysis (n=60) and hierarchical analysis (n=50), each having its advantages, disadvantages, and practical considerations. We also identified key criteria to evaluate a segmentation framework: internal validity, external validity, identifiability/interpretability, substantiality, stability, actionability/accessibility, and parsimony.ConclusionsData-driven population segmentation has been widely applied and holds great potential in managing population health. The evaluations of segmentation outcome require the interplay of data analytics and subject matter expertise. The optimal framework for segmentation requires further research.

AB BackgroundFalls are a public health issue for the older adult population and more so for people with dementia (PWD). Compared with their cognitively intact peers, PWD are at higher risk of falls and injurious falls. This randomised controlled trial aims to test the clinical and cost effectiveness of Tai Chi to improve postural balance among community-dwelling PWD and to assess the feasibility of conducting a larger definitive trial to reduce the incidence of falls among PWD.MethodsA 3-centre parallel group randomised controlled trial with embedded process evaluation. One hundred and fifty community-dwelling dyads of a person with dementia and their informal carer will be recruited and assessed at baseline and at six-month follow-up. Dyads will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either usual care or usual care plus a Tai Chi intervention for 20weeks. The Tai Chi intervention will consist of weekly classes (45min' Tai Chi plus up to 45min for informal discussion, with up to 10 dyads per class) and home-based exercises (20min per day to be facilitated by the carer). Home practice of Tai Chi will be supported by the use of behaviour change techniques with the Tai Chi instructor at a home visit in week 3-4 of the intervention (action planning, coping planning, self-monitoring, and alarm clock reminder) and at the end of each class (feedback on home practice). The primary outcome is dynamic balance measured using the Timed Up and Go test, coinciding with the end of the 20-week intervention phase for participants in the Tai Chi arm. Secondary outcomes for PWD include functional balance, static balance, fear of falling, global cognitive functioning, visual-spatial cognitive functioning, quality of life, and falls. Secondary outcomes for carers include dynamic balance, static balance, quality of life, costs, and carer burden.DiscussionThis trial is the first in the UK to test the effectiveness of Tai Chi to improve balance among PWD. The trial will inform a future study that will be the first in the world to use Tai Chi in a trial to prevent falls among PWD.Trial registrationNCT02864056.

AB BackgroundTo achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, Indian States have implemented different strategies to arrest high out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) and to increase equity into healthcare system. Tamil Nadu (TN) and Rajasthan have implemented free medicine scheme in all public hospitals and West Bengal (WB) has devised Fair Price Medicine Shop (FPMS) scheme, a public-private-partnership model in the state. In this background, the objectives of the paper are to - Study the utilization pattern of public in-patient care facilities for the states,Examine the effectiveness of the strategies adopted by the states to arrest high OOPE andAnalyze the extent of equity in public in-patient care services in the states.MethodsNational Sample Survey (71st and 60th round) data, Detailed Demand for Grants of the state governments and the National Rural/Urban Health Mission data have been used for the study. Exploratory data analysis and benefit incidence analysis have been applied to estimate the utilization, OOPE and extend of equity in the states.ResultsThe results show that overall utilization of public facilities in TN and Rajasthan has increased substantially; whereas, utilization of public facility has decreased in WB even among the poorest. In addition, OOPE for both medical and medicine is the highest in WB among three states for public sector hospitalizations. Surprisingly, OOPE on medicine is the highest for the poorest class of WB. Analysis showed that the mismatch between actual need and FPMS drug-list has led to high OOPE in the state. Overall, benefit incidence of public subsidy is the highest among the poorest class in all the states. However, geographical sector-wise inequity in public subsidy distribution persists in the states. Analysis of cost of inpatient care shows that TN provides the maximum subsidy for hospitalization and WB provides the minimum. An inverse relationship between utilization of inpatient care and public subsidy has been observed from the analysis.ConclusionIn conclusion we could say that TN & Rajasthan have successfully implemented their health financing strategies to reduce the health expenditure burden. However, policy-level changes are required to improve the situation in WB.

AB News media monitoring is an important scientific tool. By treating news reporters as data collectors and their reports as qualitative accounts of a fast changing public health landscape, researchers can glean many valuable insights. Yet, there have been surprisingly few innovations in public health media monitoring, with nearly all studies relying on labor-intensive content analyses limited to a small number of media reports. We propose to advance this subfield by using scalable machine learning. In potentially the largest contemporary public health media monitoring study to date, we systematically characterize global news reports surrounding electronic cigarettes or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) using natural language processing techniques. News reports including ENDS terms (e.g., "electronic cigarettes") from over 100,000 sources (all sources archived on Google News or Bing News, as well as all news articles shared on Twitter) were monitored for 1 January 2013 through 31 July 2018. The geographic and subject (e.g., prevalence, bans, quitting, warnings, marketing, prices, age, flavor and industry) foci of news articles, their popularity among readers who share news on social media, and the sentiment behind news articles were assessed algorithmically. Globally there were 86,872 ENDS news reports with coverage increasing from 8 (standard deviation [SD] = 8) stories per day in 2013 to 75 (SD = 56) stories per day during 2018. The focus of ENDS news spanned 148 nations, with the plurality focusing on the United States (34% of all news). Potentially overlooked hotspots of ENDS media activity included China, Egypt, Russia, Ukraine, and Paraguay. The most common subject was warnings about ENDS (18%), followed by bans on using ENDS (13%) and ENDS prices (9%). Flavor and age restrictions were the least covered news subjects (-1% each). Among different subject foci, reports on quitting cigarettes using ENDS had the highest probability of scoring in the top three deciles of popularity rankings. Moreover, ENDS news on quitting and prices had a more positive sentiment on average than news with other subject foci. Public health leaders can use these trends to stay abreast of how ENDS are portrayed in the media, and potentially how the public perceives ENDS. Because our analytical strategies are updated in near real time, we aim to make media monitoring part of standard practice to support evidence-based tobacco control in the future.

AB Background
   Type 2 diabetes is an escalating public health problem in Nepal. The current study aims to assess the prevalence, associated factors, awareness, treatment, and control of type 2 diabetes in a semi-urban area of Nepal.
   Methods
   A population-based cross-sectional survey was conducted including 2,310 adults aged 25 years or above from a semi-urban area of Lekhnath Municipality of Nepal, during October 2016 to April 2017 using the World Health Organization (WHO) STEPS approach. Data on demographics, behavioral risk factors, blood pressure, anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist and hip circumference), and fasting blood glucose were collected by face-to-face interviews during a door-to-door visit. Participants were considered to have type 2 diabetes if they had previously been diagnosed by a physician and/or were on antidiabetic medications and/or had fasting blood glucose >= 7.0 mmol/L. Participants were classified as being aware of their diabetes conditions if they had earlier been told that they had type 2 diabetes. Treatment of diabetes among those aware was if participants received any kind of medication treatment or counseling, and control of diabetes among those treated was defined as fasting blood glucose level was <7.0 mmol/L. Odds Ratio (OR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) was used to determine the strength of association.
   Results
   The prevalence of type 2 diabetes was 11.7% (95% CI: 10.5-13.1). Among type 2 diabetes participants, 65% were aware of their disease, 94% of those who were aware received treatment, and 21% of the treated subjects had their diabetes under control. Factors significantly associated with type 2 diabetes were older age (OR = 3.2 for age group 45-54 years, OR = 3.8 for age group 55-64 years), Janajati ethnicity (OR = 1.4), abdominal obesity (OR = 2.3), being overweight or obese (OR = 1.4), and hypertension (OR = 2.0), while protective factors included being a female (OR = 0.4), medium physical activity (OR = 0.3), high physical activity (OR = 0.2), and not having family history of diabetes (OR = 0.3).
   Conclusions
   The study revealed a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes among adults. Older age, male gender, Janajati ethnicity, abdominal obesity, overweight or obesity, hypertension, low physical activity, and family history of diabetes were associated with type 2 diabetes. Immediate public health and individual measures are warranted to reduce further burden of type 2 diabetes.

TI Prevalence and factors associated with stunting and thinness among
   school-age children in Arba Minch Health and Demographic Surveillance

AB Introduction
   Despite consistent economic growth in the country, malnutrition remains one of the major public health problems in Ethiopia. The prevalence of malnutrition and its associated factors are well studied among under-five children. However, there is a paucity of evidence among older children in developing countries including Ethiopia. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of stunting and thinness and their associated factors among school-age children.
   Methods
   A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among randomly selected 389 school-age children in Arba Minch Health and Demographic Surveillance Site, Southern Ethiopia, during April and May 2017. Height for age and body mass index for age z scores were calculated using WHO Anthro Plus software as indicators of stunting and thinness respectively. A binary logistic regression model was used to assess the association between independent and outcome variables.
   Results
   The prevalence of stunting and thinness were 41.9% (95% CI: 37-47) and 8.0% (95% CI: 5.4-10.8) respectively. The likelihood of stunting was significantly higher among children within the age group of 12-14 years old (AOR = 2.97, 95% CI: 1.78-4.95); children who were male (AOR = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.21-3.10); children living in households with medium wealth terciles (AOR = 2.90, 95%CI: 1.39-6.04); and children who were non-enrolled in schools (AOR = 2.25, 95% CI: (1.37-3.70). Moreover, thinness was 63% less common among children who had a dietary diversity score of <4 food groups (AOR = 0.37, 95%CI: 0.16-0.89).
   Conclusion
   The prevalence of thinness is low when compared to the prevalence reported by a single national school health and nutrition survey in Ethiopia. Stunting is a major public health concern. Therefore, this finding warrants the need to implement school health and nutrition programs to improve the nutritional status of school-age children in the study area. The interventions should focus towards both gender and special emphasis should also be given to increase the enrollment of children in schools. In addition, effort should be taken by stakeholders in different hierarchies to improve the family wealth status.
