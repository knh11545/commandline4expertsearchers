AB  - Background: As in most rare diseases, little is known on how primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) affects the patient's daily functioning and mental wellbeing. We aimed to identify all studies that examined the psychosocial impact that PCD has on the lives of patients. Method(s): We searched MEDLINE, EBSCO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO and EMBASE for qualitative and quantitative studies. Result(s): We found 260 studies, of which 14 were included. Five of the included studies had qualitative approaches. Increasing age was associated with worsening of respiratory symptoms, physical, and mental domains of health-related quality of life, with a greater decline compared with reference populations. Patients felt physically impaired, e.g. less energy and difficulty keeping up with others. Social implications included embarrassment and a sense of isolation, with patients concealing symptoms and/or their diagnosis. Isolation intensified with lack of public and professional awareness of PCD. Patients were emotionally affected by PCD and expressed anxiety about getting sick or when thinking about their future health. Treatment burden was an issue for patients, whilst acknowledging treatments improved symptom. Conclusion(s): Health-related quality of life decreases with age in patients with PCD. For all age groups, PCD adversely affects physical, emotional, social functioning, and treatment burden. Interventions that ameliorate these issues need investigation.

AB  - Primary ciliary dyskinesia is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic based disease causing functional and/or structural defects of cilia. However, there are little information about the genetic basis of this disease. By this time, we know that, mutations on the DNAI1 and DNA5H genes are responsible for encoding of dynein proteins of cilia, causing this disorder. Discrimination of the PCD from other diseases like Cystic fibrosis is quite problematic. Discrimination and treatment will be easier if the genetic basis of the PCD is known. In the proposed work, we plan to carry out whole genome exome sequencing on 3 families with PCD siblings. Each these families have healthy parents and two sick children. As a result of exome sequencing, we will able to identify common SNP's and/or affected common genes related with PCD. Then, the data obtained from exome sequencing will be used as the input to PANOGA to identify affected pathways. Thus, we will be able to study PCD aetiology via affected pathways. Eventually, we aim to provide a novel marker for diagnosis of PCD.
