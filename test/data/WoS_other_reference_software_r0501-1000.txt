TI Health workers' perception of malaria rapid diagnostic test and factors
   influencing compliance with test results in Ebonyi state, Nigeria
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PERFORMANCE
AB Background
   The standard practice in treating uncomplicated malaria is to prescribe artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for only patients with positive test results. However, health workers (HWs) sometimes prescribe ACTs for patients with negative malaria rapid diagnostic test (mRDT) results. Available evidence on HWs perception of mRDT and their level of compliance with test results in Nigeria lacks adequate stratification by state and context. We assessed HWs perception of mRDT and factors influencing ACTs prescription to patients with negative mRDT results in Ebonyi state, Nigeria.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 303 HWs who treat suspected malaria patients in 40 randomly selected public and private health facilities in Ebonyi state. Health workers' perception of mRDT was assessed with 18 equally weighted five-point likert scale questions with maximum obtainable total score of 90. Scores >= 72 were graded as good and less, as poor perception. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression model at 5% significance level.
   Results
   Mean age of respondents was 34.6 +/- 9.4 years, 229 (75.6%) were females, 180 (59.4%) community health workers and 67 (22.1%) medical doctors. Overall, 114 (37.6%) respondents across healthcare facility strata had poor perception of mRDT. Respondents who prescribed ACTs to patients with negative mRDT results within six months preceding the survey were 154 (50.8%) [PHCs: 50 (42.4%), General hospitals: 18 (47.4%), tertiary facility: 51 (79.7%) and missionary hospitals: 35 (42.2%)]. Poor HWs' perception of mRDT promoted prescription of ACT to patients with negative mRDT results (AOR = 5.6, 95% C.I = 3.2-9.9). The likelihood of prescribing ACTs to patients with negative mRDT results was higher among HWs in public health facilities (AOR = 2.8, 95% C.I = 1.4-5.5) than those in the private.
   Conclusions
   The poor perception of mRDT and especially common prescribing of ACTs to patients with negative mRDT results among HWs in Ebonyi state calls for context specific interventions to improve their perception and compliance with mRDT test results.

TI A novel framework for evaluating the impact of individual
   decision-making on public health outcomes and its potential application
   to study antiviral treatment collection during an influenza pandemic
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID BEHAVIOR; MODEL; TRANSMISSION; METAANALYSIS; SPREAD; RISK
AB The importance of accounting for social and behavioural processes when studying public health emergencies has been well-recognised. For infectious disease outbreaks in particular, several methods of incorporating individual behaviour have been put forward, but very few are based on established psychological frameworks. In this paper, we develop a decision framework based on the COM-B model of behaviour change to investigate the impact of individual decision-making on public health outcomes. We demonstrate the application of our decision framework in a proof-of-concept case study based on the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza pandemic in the UK. The National Pandemic Flu Service (NPFS) was set up in England during the pandemic as a means to provide antiviral (AV) treatment to clinically ill patients with influenza-like illness, via telephone calls or internet screening, thereby averting the need to see a doctor. The evaluated patients based on a clinical algorithm and authorised AV drugs for collection via community collection points. We applied our behavioural framework to evaluate the influence of human behaviour on AV collection rates, and subsequently to identify interventions that could help improve AV collection rates. Our model was validated against empirically collected pandemic data from 2009 in the UK. We also performed a sensitivity analysis to identify potentially effective interventions by varying model parameters. Using our behavioural framework in a proof-of-concept case study, we found that interventions geared towards increasing people's 'Capability' and 'Opportunity' are likely to result in increased AV collection, potentially resulting in fewer influenza-related hospitalisations and deaths. We note that important behavioural data from public health emergencies are largely scarce. Insights obtained from models such as ours can, not only be very useful in designing healthcare interventions, but also inform future data collection.

TI Post-overdose interventions triggered by calling 911: Centering the
   perspectives of people who use drugs (PWUDs)
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article

   IMPACT; RISK
AB Background
   Opioid overdose deaths have increased exponentially in the United States. Bystander response to opioid overdose ideally involves administering naloxone, providing rescue breathing, and calling 911 to summon emergency medical assistance. Recently in the US, public health and public safety agencies have begun seeking to use 911 calls as a method to identify and deliver post-overdose interventions to opioid overdose patients. Little is known about the opinions of PWUDs about the barriers, benefits, or potential harms of post overdose interventions linked to the 911 system. We sought to understand the perspectives of PWUDs about a method for using 911 data to identify opioid overdose cases and trigger a post-overdose intervention.
   Methods and findings
   We conducted three focus groups with 11 PWUDs in 2018. Results are organized into 4 categories: willingness to call 911 (benefits and risks of calling), thoughts about a technique to identify opioid overdoses in 911 data (benefits and concerns), thoughts about the proposed post-overdose intervention (benefits and concerns), and recommendations for developing an ideal post-overdose intervention. For most participants, calling 911 was synonymous with "calling the police" and law enforcement-related fears were pervasive, limiting willingness to engage with the 911 system. The technique to identify opioid overdoses and the proposed post-overdose intervention were identified as potentially lifesaving, but the benefits were balanced by concerns related to law enforcement involvement, intervention timing, and risks to privacy/reputation. Nearly universally, participants wished for a way to summon emergency medical assistance without triggering a law enforcement response.
   Conclusions
   The fact that the 911 system in the US inextricably links emergency medical assistance with law enforcement response inherently problematizes calling 911 for PWUDs, and has implications for surveillance and intervention. It is imperative to center the perspectives of PWUDs when designing and implementing interventions that rely on the 911 system for activation.

AB Aedes albopictus is a viable vector for several infectious diseases such as Zika, West Nile, Dengue viruses and others. Originating from Asia, this invasive species is rapidly expanding into North American temperate areas and urbanized places causing major concerns for public health. Previous analyses show that warm temperatures and high humidity during the mosquito season are ideal conditions for A. albopictus development, while its distribution is correlated with population density. To better understand A. albopictus expansion into urban places it is important to consider the role of both environmental and neighborhood factors. The present study aims to assess the relative importance of both environmental variables and neighborhood factors in the prediction of A. albopictus' presence in Southeast Pennsylvania using MaxEnt (version 3.4.1) machine-learning algorithm. Three models are developed that include: (1) exclusively environmental variables, (2) exclusively neighborhood factors, and (3) a combination of environmental variables and neighborhood factors. Outcomes from the three models are compared in terms of variable importance, accuracy, and the spatial distribution of predicted A. albopictus'presence. All three models predicted the presence of A. albopictus in urban centers, however, each to a different spatial extent. The combined model resulted in the highest accuracy (74.7%) compared to the model with only environmental variables (73.5%) and to the model with only neighborhood factors (72.1%) separately. Although the combined model does not essentially increase the accuracy in the prediction, the spatial patterns of mosquito distribution are different when compared to environmental or neighborhood factors alone. Environmental variables help to explain conditions associated with mosquitoes in suburban/rural areas, while neighborhood factors summarize the local conditions that can also impact mosquito habitats in predominantly urban places. Overall, the present study shows that MaxEnt is suitable for integrating neighborhood factors associated with mosquito presence that can complement and improve species distribution modeling.

AB Background Enhanced surveillance for confirmed cases of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) was introduced in the Netherlands in 2003, in which reference laboratory data (NRLBM) are linked with notification data (OSIRIS). The quality of surveillance information is important for public health decision making. Our objective was to describe the system and evaluate it for data completeness and timeliness. Methods Cases reported in the surveillance system from 2004 to 2016 were included. For the notification data, we used information on serogroup, vaccination status, mortality, and country of infection as indicators for record completeness. Notification times to regional and national level were calculated using the reported dates available in the notification database. Results A total of 2123 cases were reported in the years 2004-2016, of which 1.968 (93%) were reported by the reference laboratory and 1.995 (94%) in the notification system. Of all cases, 1.840 cases (87%) were reported in both systems and could be linked. The serogroup was known in 86% of the notified cases, and was significantly higher (94%) in the years 2013-2016. Information on vaccination status, mortality and country of infection was available in 88, 99 and 97% of notified cases, respectively. Regional notification of cases occurred within one working day for 86% of cases and 98% were notified nationally within three days. Conclusions A well performing IMD surveillance system was demonstrated and serogroup completeness has improved over the years. Underlining the need for reporting to both the clinical and laboratory surveillance system remains important to further improve the overall performance in supporting public health response and vaccination policy.

AB Background Exposure to blacklegged ticks Ixodes scapularis that transmit pathogens is thought to occur peri-domestically. However, the locations where people most frequently encounter infected ticks are not well characterized, leading to mixed messages from public health officials about where risk is highest. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on spatial risk factors for tick-borne disease and tick bites in eastern North America. We examined three scales: the residential yard, the neighborhood surrounding (but not including) the yard, and outside the neighborhood. Nineteen eligible studies represented 2741 cases of tick-borne illness and 1447 tick bites. Using random effects models, we derived pooled odds ratio (OR) estimates. Results The meta-analysis revealed significant disease risk factors at the scale of the yard (OR 2.60 95% CI 1.96 - 3.46), the neighborhood (OR 4.08 95% CI 2.49 - 6.68), and outside the neighborhood (OR 2.03 95% CI 1.59 - 2.59). Although significant risk exists at each scale, neighborhood scale risk factors best explained disease exposure. Analysis of variance revealed risk at the neighborhood scale was 57% greater than risk at the yard scale and 101% greater than risk outside the neighborhood. Conclusions This analysis emphasizes the importance of understanding and reducing tick-borne disease risk at the neighborhood scale. Risk-reducing interventions applied at each scale could be effective, but interventions applied at the neighborhood scale are most likely to protect human health.

AB Background The 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak was a wake-up call regarding the critical importance of resilient health systems. Fragile health systems can become overwhelmed during public health crises, further exacerbating the human, economic, and political toll. Important work has been done to describe the general attributes of a health system resilient to these crises, and the next step will be to identify the specific capacities that health systems need to develop and maintain to achieve resiliency. Methods We conducted a scoping review of the literature to identify recurring themes and capacities needed for health system resiliency to infectious disease outbreaks and natural hazards and any existing implementation frameworks that highlight these capacities. We also sought to identify the overlap of the identified themes and capacities with those highlighted in the World Health Organization's Joint External Evaluation. Sources of evidence included PubMed, Web of Science, OAIster, and the websites of relevant major public health organizations. Results We identified 16 themes of health system resilience, including: the need to develop plans for altered standards of care during emergencies, the need to develop plans for post-event recovery, and a commitment to quality improvement. Most of the literature described the general attributes of a resilient health system; no implementation frameworks were identified that could translate these elements into specific capacities that health system actors can employ to improve resilience to outbreaks and natural hazards in a variety of settings. Conclusions An implementation-oriented health system resilience framework could help translate the important components of a health system identified in this review into specific capacities that actors in the health system could work to develop to improve resilience to public health crises. However, there remains a need to further refine the concept of resilience so that health systems can simultaneously achieve sustainable transformations in healthcare practice and health service delivery as well as improve their preparedness for emergencies.

AB Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the major public health problems worldwide. Despite an increasing burden of COPD in the world, it is often a neglected disease in low income countries and COPD prevalence studies are rare in Sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of COPD and its associated factors among adults in Ethiopia. Methods A community based cross sectional study was conducted from February 5 to May 20, 2019 in Abeshge district, Southern Ethiopia. A total of 734 adults aged at least 30 years were selected using multistage cluster sampling technique and included in the study. All participants were interviewed about socio-demographic characteristics, respiratory symptoms, smoking status and clinical characteristics. Moreover, all participants underwent spirometry. We defined COPD as a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC of less than 70%. Data were entered into Epi-data manager 4.4 and analyzed using SPSS version 23. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression analysis were used and p-value < 0.05 was considered as significant. Results Of the 779 adults invited to participate, 734 adults (421 men and 313 women) were participated in this study. The mean (SD) age of the participants was 39.15 (+/- 9.36) years, within the age range of 30-75 years. The prevalence of COPD was 17.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.1-20.6). Factors significantly associated with COPD were age above 50 years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.91, 95% CI [1.10, 3.30]), being smoker (AOR = 4.54, 95% CI [2.69, 7.66]), Exposed to biomass smoke (AOR = 2.05, 95% CI [1.06, 3.95]) and poor ventilated kitchen (AOR = 4.12, 95% CI [2.67, 6.34]). Conclusion It is evident from this study that the prevalence of COPD in Ethiopia is high. Factors such as old age, cigarette smoking, exposure to biomass smoke and poor kitchen ventilation plays a role in the development of COPD.

ID PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; PARTICIPATION; DISABILITIES
AB Background People with long-term health conditions face barriers to physical activity and community health interventions despite potential life-changing benefits for self-management of their condition and wellbeing. A weekly mass participation running, walking and volunteering event called parkrun launched a project called PROVE in 2016 to engage people living with long-term health conditions in England. Over the 3 year project, parkrun appointed volunteer Outreach Ambassadors with a specialist interest in the health condition they represented whose role was to ensure parkrun was welcoming, supportive and inclusive. This qualitative study aimed to understand the experience of the PROVE project for people with long-term health conditions. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 PROVE Outreach Ambassadors representing 13 different long-term health conditions in England. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. Rigour and transparency were sought in addition to utilising independent researchers to offer alternative interpretations of the data. Results Data analysis resulted in 4 overarching themes and 13 subthemes. Outreach Ambassadors believed that parkrun was already supportive of people with long-term health conditions, but that the PROVE project enabled the support to be delivered in a more structured way across health conditions and locations. Outreach Ambassadors believed that the PROVE project had the potential to create a welcoming, safe space for people with long-term health conditions to participate as walkers, runners or volunteers. Success of the PROVE project was believed to be dependent on being realistic about the potential to bring about change, challenging people's perceptions of parkrun and engaging with key stakeholders and advocacy groups. Challenges for parkrun were believed to be around communication, demonstrating impact and the project's dependence on volunteers for delivery. Conclusions This is the first study of its kind to explore the public health potential of parkrun for people with long-term health conditions. parkrun's PROVE project was regarded to be important for ensuring that people with long-term health conditions can engage in physical activity and volunteering in a safe and supportive environment. The findings have important implications for parkrun, policy makers and physical activity providers looking to deliver inclusive community physical activity opportunities.

TI The impact of socioeconomic status on emergency department outcome in a
   low-income country setting: A registry-based analysis
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID RACE
AB Background
   The impact of socioeconomic status on health has been established via a broad body of literature, largely from high-income countries. Investigative efforts in low- and middle-income countries have suffered from a lack of reporting standardization required to draw comparisons across countries of varying economic strata. In this study we aimed to evaluate the impact of socioeconomic status on emergency department outcomes in a low-income African country using international data classification systems.
   Methods
   This was a retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary care center in northern Madagascar. Data were abstracted from paper charts into an electronic registry using Integrated Public Use Microdata Series codes for occupation, Nam-Powers-Boyd (NPB) scores for socioeconomic status, and Clinical Classifications Software ICD-9 equivalents for diagnosis. Outcome was dichotomized to the combined disposition of death or transfer directly to operating theater (OT) versus discharge. We used t-tests to compare baseline characteristics between these groups. We used chi-square analysis to test the association between occupational class and diagnosis. Finally, multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed examining the impact of NPB score on death/OT outcome, adjusting for age, gender, diagnosis and occupation.
   Results
   5271 patients were seen during the 21-month study period with a death/OT rate of 9.7%. Older age and male gender were more common in death/OT patients (both p<0.001), and were shown to have positive odds ratios for this outcome in multivariate modeling (p<0.006 and <0.001). Occupational class was found to influence diagnosis for all classes (p<0.001) except Sales and Office. Adjusting for these 3 factors, we found a strong independent association between NPB quartile and death/OT outcome. Relative to the 1st quartile, the odds ratio in the 4th quartile was 2.9 (p = 0.004), the 3rd quartile 1.8 (p = 0.094), and the 2nd quartile 3.1 (p<0.001).
   Conclusion
   To our knowledge, this is the first Malagasy study describing the relationship between socioeconomic status on emergency care outcomes. We found a stronger effect on health in this setting than in high-income countries, highlighting an important healthcare disparity. By using standardized classification systems we hope this study will serve as a model to facilitate future comparative efforts.

TI Differences in energy and nutritional content of menu items served by
   popular UK chain restaurants with versus without voluntary menu
   labelling: A cross-sectional study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTHIER DIETS; FOOD; COUNTRIES; OBESITY
AB Background
   Poor diet is a leading driver of obesity and morbidity. One possible contributor is increased consumption of foods from out of home establishments, which tend to be high in energy density and portion size. A number of out of home establishments voluntarily provide consumers with nutritional information through menu labelling. The aim of this study was to determine whether there are differences in the energy and nutritional content of menu items served by popular UK restaurants with versus without voluntary menu labelling.
   Methods and findings
   We identified the 100 most popular UK restaurant chains by sales and searched their websites for energy and nutritional information on items served in March-April 2018. We established whether or not restaurants provided voluntary menu labelling by telephoning head offices, visiting outlets and sourcing up-to-date copies of menus. We used linear regression to compare the energy content of menu items served by restaurants with versus without menu labelling, adjusting for clustering at the restaurant level. Of 100 restaurants, 42 provided some form of energy and nutritional information online. Of these, 13 (31%) voluntarily provided menu labelling. A total of 10,782 menu items were identified, of which total energy and nutritional information was available for 9605 (89%). Items from restaurants with menu labelling had 45% less fat (beta coefficient 0.55; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.96) and 60% less salt (beta coefficient 0.40; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.92). The data were cross-sectional, so the direction of causation could not be determined.
   Conclusion
   Menu labelling is associated with serving items with less fat and salt in popular UK chain restaurants. Mandatory menu labelling may encourage reformulation of items served by restaurants. This could lead to public health benefits.

TI Enhancing timeliness of drug overdose mortality surveillance: A machine
   learning approach
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID DEATH CERTIFICATES; CLASSIFICATION; MODELS
AB Background
   Timely data is key to effective public health responses to epidemics. Drug overdose deaths are identified in surveillance systems through ICD-10 codes present on death certificates. ICD-10 coding takes time, but free-text information is available on death certificates prior to ICD-10 coding. The objective of this study was to develop a machine learning method to classify free-text death certificates as drug overdoses to provide faster drug overdose mortality surveillance.
   Methods
   Using 2017-2018 Kentucky death certificate data, free-text fields were tokenized and features were created from these tokens using natural language processing (NLP). Word, bigram, and trigram features were created as well as features indicating the part-of-speech of each word. These features were then used to train machine learning classifiers on 2017 data. The resulting models were tested on 2018 Kentucky data and compared to a simple rule-based classification approach. Documented code for this method is available for reuse and extensions: https://github.com/pjward5656/dcnlp.
   Results
   The top scoring machine learning model achieved 0.96 positive predictive value (PPV) and 0.98 sensitivity for an F-score of 0.97 in identification of fatal drug overdoses on test data. This machine learning model achieved significantly higher performance for sensitivity (p<0.001) than the rule-based approach. Additional feature engineering may improve the model's prediction. This model can be deployed on death certificates as soon as the free-text is available, eliminating the time needed to code the death certificates.
   Conclusion
   Machine learning using natural language processing is a relatively new approach in the context of surveillance of health conditions. This method presents an accessible application of machine learning that improves the timeliness of drug overdose mortality surveillance. As such, it can be employed to inform public health responses to the drug overdose epidemic in near-real time as opposed to several weeks following events.

TI Evaluating access to oral anti-diabetic medicines: A cross-sectional
   survey of prices, availability and affordability in Shaanxi Province,
   Western China
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PREVALENCE
AB Objectives
   To assess the availability and affordability of oral anti-diabetic medicines in Shaanxi Province, Western China.
   Methods
   In 2015, the prices and availability of 8 anti-diabetic medicines covering 31 different dosage forms and strengths were collected in six cities of Shaanxi Province. A total of 72 public hospitals and 72 private pharmacies were sampled, using a modified methodology developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Health Action International (HAI). Medicine prices were compared with international reference prices to obtain a median price ratio. For urban residents, affordability was assessed as the lowest-paid unskilled government workers to purchase cost of standard treatment in days' wages; for rural residents, days' net income was used.
   Results
   The mean availabilities of originator brands (OBs) and generics were 34.3% and 28.7% in public hospitals, and 44.1% and 64.4% in the private pharmacies. OBs and the lowest priced generics (LPGs) were procured at 12.38 and 4.52 times the international reference price in public hospitals, and 10.26 and 2.81 times the international reference prices in private pharmacies. Treatments with OBs were unaffordable even for urban residents. The affordability of the LPGs was good, except for acarbose, repaglinide and pioglitazone.
   Conclusions
   Most anti-diabetic medicines cannot met the WHO's availability target (80% availability) in Shaanxi Province. The high prices of OBs had severely influenced the affordability of medicines, especially for the rural residents. Effective policies should be initiated to ensure the Chinese people a better access to more affordable anti-diabetic medicines.

AB Background This study investigated the association between intimate partner violence (IPV) identified on routine prenatal screening and perinatal outcomes for mother and infant. Methods Routinely collected perinatal data for a cohort of all women and their infants born in public health facilities in Sydney (Australia) over the period 2014-2016 (N = 52,509) were analysed to investigate the risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes associated with a history of IPV. The association between an affirmative response on prenatal IPV screening and low birth weight (LBW) < 2.5 kg, preterm birth < 37 weeks, breastfeeding indicators and postnatal depressive symptoms (PND) was investigated in a series of logistic regression models. Results IPV was associated with an increased risk of PND (OR = 2.53, 95% CI 1.76-3.63), not breastfeeding at birth (OR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.30-2.09), non-exclusive breastfeeding at discharge (OR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.33-2.07) and first post-natal visit (OR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.24-1.91). Self-reported fear of a partner was strongly associated with an increased risk of PND (OR = 3.53, 95% CI 2.50-5.00), and also LBW (OR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.12-2.22), preterm birth (OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.08-1.76), lack of early initiation of breastfeeding (OR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.28-2.17), non-exclusive breastfeeding at discharge from hospital (OR = 1.60, 95% CI 1.24-2.06) and at the first post-natal visit (OR = 1.27, 95% CI 0.99-3.04). Conclusions IPV reported at the time of pregnancy was associated with adverse infant and maternal health outcomes. Although women may be disinclined to report IPV during pregnancy, universal, routine antenatal assessment for IPV is essential for early identification and appropriate management to improve maternal and newborn health.

AB BackgroundMalaria remains a major public health problem in Ethiopia. The use of LLINs is an effective approach to reducing transmission. Persistent use of LLINs is determined by numerous factors. Quantitative studies have assessed LLIN ownership and utilization, but the behavioral, socio-cultural, socioeconomic and net distribution contexts that impact their use have not been examined in depth. This study aimed to explore barriers of persistent LLIN use among communities around Lake Tana.MethodsTwenty-three community residents who owned LLINs (15) or not (8) during the study period and 38 key informants were interviewed from April to June 2017. Phenomenological study was employed to explore the local contexts and factors that influence persistent use of LLINs. Individuals were purposefully selected to capture different views. Community residents were selected based on their permanent residence and LLIN use experience. Key informants were health extension workers, local leaders, students, and health professionals. The data were managed using QSR International NVivo Version 10 software and coded, and themes were identified.ResultsKilling ability of nets against arthropods other than mosquitoes reportedly made use of LLINs a favored malaria prevention method despite their ineffectiveness after 3months. Conical nets were preferred due to their compatibility with varied sleeping structures. Numerous factors influenced persistent use, notably erroneous perceptions about LLINs, malaria and mosquitoes; bedbug infestation; inconvenience; unintended uses; distribution problem of nets; and socio-cultural and economic factors. Unintended uses were often associated with local needs and seldom linked with social issues and deficiencies in information about malaria and LLINs. Collateral benefits were considered important, principally in terms of disinfestation of bedbugs.ConclusionsNon-persistent LLIN use was associated with inconvenient bed net design and early damage; non-potency of the insecticide against other arthropods; facilitation of bedbug infestation; unintended uses; wrong perceptions about malaria, mosquitoes, and LLINs; and inadequate follow-up regarding LLINs utilization. Distribution of conical nets and provision of adequate information on LLINs and malaria may promote persistent use. Using an insecticide that also kills arthropods other than mosquitoes may reduce unintended uses and increase persistent use.

AB BackgroundThough Ethiopia achieved the fourth Millennium Development Goal, commit to reducing under five child mortalities by the year 2015, but perinatal mortality has remained a major public health problem in Ethiopia, and the Tigray region is experiencing a high perinatal mortality rate. This study aimed to assess the risk factors attributed to perinatal death in the Tigray region.MethodsA retrospective cross-sectional study was used. The information collected from 2738 children born five years preceding the survey was considered. Variables such as maternal social and demographic characteristics, child demographic characteristics, health and environmental factors were considered as risk factors of perinatal death. The study used descriptive statistics, and logistic regression model to identify significant correlates of perinatal mortality.ResultsThe data showed that from total children included in the study, 4.1% are early neonatal deaths, and 2.1% are stillbirth. Overall the prevalence of experiencing perinatal mortality was 6.2% the Tigray region. The logistic analysis revealed, factors small birth interval (less than 15months) (AOR=7.902; 95% CI: (4.526-13.795)) and 16-26months (AOR =2.088; 95% CI: (1.292-3.375)), poor wealth index (AOR=1.948; 95% CI: (1.011-3.754)), having no toilet facility (AOR =1.649; 95% CI: (1.093-2.488)), child sex (being male) (AOR =1.74; 95% CI: (1.234-2.454)), giving birth at older maternal age (45-49years) (AOR=0.293; 95% CI: (0.128-0.668)), rural residence and using the unprotected well water were significantly associated with a higher risk of perinatal death.ConclusionsThe study identified sex of a child, previous birth intervals, availability of toilet facilities, wealth index, birth type, mother's age, parity, place of residence, mother's occupation and source of drinking water were the factors significantly associated with perinatal mortality. The prevalence of perinatal mortality shows that Tigray region was experiencing a high perinatal mortality rate than the national.

AB Background E-cigarette use prevalence has grown rapidly in the US. Despite the popularity of these products, few acute exposure toxicity studies exist, and studies on long-term pulmonary health effects are limited. E-cigarette users who are never combustible cigarette smokers (sole users) constitute a unique group of young adults that may be at increased risk of bronchial hyperreactivity and development of asthma. Given the public health concern about the potential pulmonary health effects of sole e-cigarette use, we aimed to examine the association between e-cigarette use and asthma among never combustible cigarette smokers. Methods We pooled 2016 and 2017 data of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a large, cross-sectional telephone survey of adults aged 18 years and older in the U.S. We included 402,822 participants without any history of combustible cigarette smoking (defined as lifetime smoking < 100 cigarettes) and with complete self-reported information on key variables. Current e-cigarette use, further classified as daily or occasional use, was the primary exposure. The main outcome, asthma, was defined as self-reported history of asthma. We assess the relationship of sole e-cigarette use with asthma using multivariable logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, race, income, level of education and body mass index. Results Of 402,822 never combustible cigarette smokers, there were 3103 (0.8%) current e-cigarette users and 34,074 (8.5%) with asthma. The median age group of current e-cigarette users was 18-24 years. Current e-cigarette use was associated with 39% higher odds of self-reported asthma compared to never e-cigarette users (Odds Ratio [OR], 1.39; 95% confidence interval: 1.15, 1.68). There was a graded increased odds of having asthma with increase of e-cigarette use intensity. The odds ratio of self-reported asthma increased from 1.31 (95% confidence interval: 1.05, 1.62) in occasional users to 1.73 (95% confidence interval: 1.21, 2.48) in daily e-cigarette users, compared to never e-cigarette users. Conclusion Our findings from a large, nationally representative survey suggest increased odds of asthma among never combustible smoking e-cigarette users. This may have potential public health implications, providing a strong rationale to support future longitudinal studies of pulmonary health in young e-cigarette-using adults.

AB Background
   Although the interregional disparity in chronic kidney disease (CKD) prevalence has been reported globally, little is known about differences in CKD prevalence within a region. We aimed to study the intraregional distribution of renal function in the Northern Netherlands and identify determinants of geographical differences in renal function.
   Methods
   We included 143,735 participants from the Lifelines population-based cohort in the Northern Netherlands. Spatial analysis was performed to identify regional clusters of lower eGFR (cold spots) and higher eGFR (hot spots) at the postal code level, without and with adjustment for clinical risk factors. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the contribution of neighborhood-level health-related behaviors, socioeconomic status, and environmental factors (air pollution parameters, urbanity) to regional clustering of lower eGFR.
   Results
   Significant spatial clustering of renal function was found for eGFR as well as for early stage renal function impairment (eGFR<90 ml/min/1.73 m(2)), (p<0.001). Spatial clustering persisted after adjustment of eGFR for clinical risk factors. In adjusted cold spots, the aggregate eGFR was lower (mean +/- SD: 96.5 +/- 4.8 vs. 98.5 +/- 4.0 ml/min/1.73 m(2), p = 0.001), and the prevalence of early stage renal function impairment (35.8 +/- 10.9 vs. 28.7 +/- 9.8%, p<0.001) and CKD stages 3-5 was higher (median (interquartile range): 1.2(0.1-2.4) vs 0(0-1.4)%, p<0.001) than in hot spots. In multivariable logistic regression, exposure to NO2 (Odd ratio [OR], 1.45; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.19 to 1.75, p<0.001) was associated with cold spots (lower renal function), whereas proportion of fat intake in the diet (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.48-0.97, P = 0.031) and income (OR, 0.91; 95%CI, 0.86-0.96, p<0.001) for median level income) were inversely related.
   Conclusions
   Significant intraregional clustering of renal function, early renal function impairment and CKD were observed in the Northern Netherlands even after adjustment for renal function-related clinical risk factors. Environmental (air pollution), neighborhood-level socioeconomic factors and diet are determinants of intraregional renal function distribution. Spatial analysis might be a useful adjunct to guide public health strategies for the prevention of CKD.

TI Consumer beliefs about healthy foods and diets
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID NUTRITION LABELS; CLAIMS; INFORMATION; ATTITUDES; PACKAGE; IMPACT
AB Background
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has begun a public process to redefine how companies are allowed to use the term "healthy" on food packages. Although the definition is formulated based on the latest consensus in nutrition and epidemiological research, it is also important to understand how consumers define and understand the term if it is to be behaviorally relevant. This research is an exploratory study designed to provide a descriptive account of consumers' perceptions of and beliefs about the meaning of "healthy" food.
   Methods
   A nationwide U.S. sample of 1,290 food consumers was surveyed in December 2018. Respondents answered 15 questions designed to gauge perceptions of healthy food and to elicit preference for policies surrounding healthy food definitions. Responses are weighted to demographically match the population. Categorical variables have a sampling error of +/- 2.7%. Exploratory factor analysis is used to determine latent dimensions of health perceptions related to food type.
   Results
   Consumers were about evenly split on whether a food can be deemed healthy based solely on the foods' nutritional content (52.1% believing as such) or whether there were other factors that affect whether a food is healthy (47.9% believing as such). Consumers were also about evenly split on whether an individual food can be considered healthy (believed by 47.9%) or whether this healthiness is instead a characteristic of one's overall diet (believed by 52.1%). Ratings of individual food products revealed that "healthy" perceptions are comprised of at least three underlying latent dimensions related to animal origin, preservation, and freshness/processing. Focusing on individual macronutrients, perceived healthiness was generally decreasing in a food's fat, sodium, and carbohydrate content and increasing in protein content. About 40% of consumers thought a healthy label implied they should increase consumption of the type of food bearing the label and about 15% thought the label meant they could eat all they wanted.
   Conclusions
   Results suggest consumer's perceptions of "healthy," which is primarily based on fat content, partially aligns with the FDA definition but also suggest consumers perceive the word as a broader and more nuanced concept that defies easy, uniform definition. Results highlight areas where nutrition education may be needed and suggest disclosures may need to accompany health claims so that consumers know what, precisely, is being communicated.

AB Background
   Co-infection of intestinal helminthic infections (IHIs) and tuberculosis (TB) has appeared as a public health issue, especially in developing countries. Some recent studies have been carried out on the possible relevance of IHIs to TB. The current systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the prevalence and odds ratio (OR) of IHIs among TB patients and clarify the relationship between IHIs and TB disease.
   Methods
   For the purpose of the study, five English databases including PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science (ISI), and Google scholar were searched (up to January 30, 2019) in order to find the related studies. Random-effects meta-analysis model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence, odds ratio (OR), and 95% confidence interval (CI). Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied.
   Results
   A total of 20 studies including 10 studies with case-control design (2217 patients and 2520 controls) and 10 studies with cross-sectional design (a total of 2415 participants) met the eligibility criteria. As shown by the random-effects model, the pooled prevalence of IHIs in TB patients was estimated to be 26% (95% CI, 17-35%; 1249/4632). The risk of IHI was higher in TB patients compared to controls but this was not statistically significant. However, according to genus/species, the pooled OR of Strongyloides stercoralis (S. stercoralis) (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.59-4.54) had a significantly higher risk in TB patients compared to controls. Nevertheless, the results of random effects model showed no statistically significant association between overall pooled OR of IHIs in TB patients compared to controls in case-control studies (OR, 1; 95% CI, 0-1).
   Conclusions
   It is highly recommended that more precise studies should be carried out by researchers in order to better understand this association. Also, it is of great importance to include the periodic screenings for IHIs in the routine clinical care of these patients.

AB BackgroundDengue is an emerging vector disease with frequent outbreaks in Nepal that pose a major threat to public health. Dengue control activities are mostly outbreak driven, and still lack systematic interventions while most people have poor health-related knowledge and practices. Mobile Short Message Service (SMS) represents a low-cost health promotion intervention that can enhance the dengue prevention knowledge and practices of the affected communities. This study aimed to explore the acceptability, appropriateness, and effectiveness of mobile SMS intervention in improving dengue control practices.MethodsThis study was an implementation research that used mixed-methods design with intervention. A total of 300 households were divided into three groups, i.e. one control group, one dengue prevention leaflet (DPL) only intervention group and one DPL with mobile SMS intervention group (DPL+SMS). We used a structured questionnaire to collect information regarding participants' knowledge and practice of dengue prevention. We conducted in-depth interviews with key informants to measure acceptability and appropriateness of intervention. Mean difference with standard deviation (SD), one-way ANOVA, paired t-test and regression analyses were used to assess the effectiveness of the interventions. Thematic analysis was used to assess the acceptability, and appropriateness as well as barriers and enablers of the intervention.ResultsThe DPL+SMS intervention produced significantly higher mean knowledge difference (32.713.7 SD vs. 13.3 +/- 8.8 SD) and mean practice difference (27.9 +/- 11.4 SD vs 4.9 +/- 5.4 SD) compared to the DPL only group (p =0.000). Multivariate analysis showed that the DPL+SMS intervention was effective to increase knowledge by 28.6 points and practice by 28.1 points compared to the control group. The intervention was perceived as acceptable and appropriate by the study participants and key stakeholders. Perceived barriers included reaching private network users and poor network in geographically remote areas, while enabling factors included mobile phone penetration, low cost, and shared responsibility.Conclusions Mobile SMS is an effective, acceptable and appropriate health intervention to improve dengue prevention practices in communities. This intervention can be adopted as a promising tool for health education against dengue and other diseases.

AB BackgroundOverweight and obesity is a major global public health challenge, and understanding the implications for healthcare systems is essential for policy planning. Past studies have typically found positive associations between obesity and healthcare utilization, but these studies have not taken into consideration that obesity is also associated with early mortality. We examined associations between body mass index (BMI, reported as kg/m(2)) and healthcare utilization with and without taking BMI-specific survival into consideration.MethodsWe used nationally representative data on 33 882 adults collected between 2002 and 2015. We computed BMI- and age-specific primary and secondary care utilization and multiplied the estimated values with gender-, age-, and BMI-specific probabilities of surviving to each age. Then, we summed the average BMI-specific utilization between 18 and 85 years.ResultsDuring a survival-adjusted lifetime, males with normal weight (BMI: 18.5-24.9) had, on average, 167 primary care, and 77 secondary care contacts. In comparison, males with overweight (BMI: 25.0-29.9), category I obesity (BMI: 30.0-34.9), and category II/III obesity (BMI >= 35.0) had 11%, 41%, and 102% more primary care, and 14%, 29%, and 78% more secondary care contacts, respectively. Females with normal weight had, on average, 210 primary care contacts and 91 secondary care contacts. Females with overweight, category I obesity, and category II/III obesity had 20%, 34%, and 81% more primary care contacts, and 26%, 16%, and 16% more secondary care contacts, respectively.ConclusionThe positive association between BMI and healthcare utilization was reduced, but not offset, when BMI-specific survival was taken into consideration. Our findings underpin previous research and suggest that interventions to offset the increasing prevalence of overweight, and especially obesity, are warranted.

AB BackgroundGiven the considerable efforts and resources required to develop practice guidelines, developers need to prioritize what topics and questions to address. This study aims to identify and describe prioritization approaches in the development of clinical, public health, or health systems guidelines.MethodsWe searched Medline and CINAHL electronic databases in addition to Google Scholar. We included papers describing prioritization approaches in sufficient detail allowing for reproducibility. We synthesized findings in a semi-quantitative way. We followed an iterative process to develop a common framework of prioritization criteria that captures all of the criteria reported by each included study.ResultsOur search captured 33,339 unique citations out of which we identified 10 papers reporting prioritization approaches for guideline development. All of the identified approaches focused on prioritizing guideline topics but none on prioritizing recommendation questions or outcomes. The two most frequently reported steps of the development process for these approaches were reviewing the grey literature (9 out of 10, 90%) and engaging various stakeholders (9 out of 10, 90%). We derived a common framework of 20 prioritization criteria that can be used when prioritizing guideline topics. The most frequently reported criteria were the health burden of disease which was included in all of the approaches, practice variation (8 out of 10, 80%), and impact on health outcomes (7 out of 10, 70%). Two of the identified approaches stood out as being comprehensive and detailed.ConclusionsWe described 10 prioritization approaches in the development of health practice guidelines. There is a need to assess the effectiveness, efficiency and transparency of the identified approaches and to develop standardized and validated priority setting tools.

AB BackgroundHypertension, itself a cardiovascular condition, is a significant risk factor for other cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension is recognized as a major public health challenge in Ghana. Beginning in 2014, a collaborative team launched the community-based hypertension improvement program (ComHIP) in one health district in Ghana. The ComHIP project, a public-private partnership, tests a community-based model that engages the private sector and utilizes information and communication technology (ICT) to control hypertension. This paper, focuses on the various challenges associated with managing hypertension in Ghana, as reported by ComHIP stakeholders.MethodsA total of 55 informants - comprising patients, health care professionals, licensed chemical sellers (LCS), national and sub-national policymakers - were purposively selected for interview and focus group discussions (FGDs). Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Where applicable, transcriptions were translated directly from local language to English. The data were then analysed using two-step thematic analysis. The protocol was approved by the two ethics review committees based in Ghana and the third, based in the United Kingdom. All participants were interviewed after giving informed consent.ResultsOur data have implications for the on-going implementation of ComHIP, especially the importance of policy maker buy-in, and the benefits, as well as drawbacks, of the program to different stakeholders. While our data show that the ComHIP initiative is acceptable to patients and healthcare providers - increasing providers' knowledge on hypertension and patients' awareness of same- there were implementation challenges identified by both patients and providers. Policy level challenges relate to task-sharing bottlenecks, which precluded nurses from prescribing or dispensing antihypertensives, and LCS from stocking same. Medication adherence and the phenomenon of medical pluralism in Ghana were identified challenges. The perspectives from the national level stakeholders enable elucidation of whole of health system challenges to ComHIP and similarly designed programmes.ConclusionsThis paper sheds important light on the patient/individual, and system level challenges to hypertension and related non-communicable disease prevention and treatment in Ghana. The data show that although the ComHIP initiative is acceptable to patients and healthcare providers, policy level task-sharing bottlenecks preclude optimal implementation of ComHIP.

AB BackgroundSalmonella outbreaks in childcare facilities are relatively rare, most often occurring secondary to contaminated food products or poor infection control practices. We report an outbreak of Salmonella Saintpaul at a pre-school facility in Ayrshire, Scotland with atypical clinical and epidemiological features.MethodsFollowing notification of the initial two cases, the multi-disciplinary Incident Management Team initiated enhanced active case finding and two environmental inspections of the site, including food preparation areas. Parent and staff interviews were conducted by the Public Health department covering attendance, symptomatology and risk factors for all probable and confirmed cases. Microbiological testing of stool samples and the facility water tank was conducted. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) was performed for positive stool samples at the national reference laboratory. Infection control measures were introduced iteratively due to the atypical progression of the outbreak.ResultsThere were 15 confirmed cases and 3 children admitted to hospital during the outbreak. However, 35.7% of cases reported extremely mild symptoms. The attack rate was 15.2%, and age of affected children ranged from 18 to 58months (mean 35months). All cases were the same Multilocus Sequence Type (MLST50). Epidemiological investigation strongly suggested person-to-person spread within the facility. Existing infection control practices were found to be of a high standard, but introduction of additional evidence-based control measures was inadequate in halting transmission. Facility staff reported concerns about lack of parental disclosure of gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly where these were mild, with 50.0% of cases having attended while symptomatic against public health advice. Voluntary two-week closure of the facility was implemented to halt transmission, following which there were no new cases. WGS results were unavailable until after the decision was taken to close the facility.ConclusionsThis is the first reported instance of a Salmonella Saintpaul outbreak at a childcare facility, or where person-to-person transmission is indicated. Clinicians should consider the influence of parental under-reporting on gastrointestinal outbreaks in childcare settings, particularly where perceived severity is low and financial or social pressures to attend work may reduce compliance. WGS cannot yet replace conventional microbiological techniques during short, localised outbreaks due to delays receiving results.

AB BackgroundHuman activity and the interaction between health conditions and activity is a critical part of understanding the overall function of individuals. The World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) models function as all aspects of an individual's interaction with the world, including organismal concepts such as individual body structures, functions, and pathologies, as well as the outcomes of the individual's interaction with their environment, referred to as activity and participation. Function, particularly activity and participation outcomes, is an important indicator of health at both the level of an individual and the population level, as it is highly correlated with quality of life and a critical component of identifying resource needs. Since it reflects the cumulative impact of health conditions on individuals and is not disease specific, its use as a health indicator helps to address major barriers to holistic, patient-centered care that result from multiple, and often competing, disease specific interventions. While the need for better information on function has been widely endorsed, this has not translated into its routine incorporation into modern health systems.PurposeWe present the importance of capturing information on activity as a core component of modern health systems and identify specific steps and analytic methods that can be used to make it more available to utilize in improving patient care. We identify challenges in the use of activity and participation information, such as a lack of consistent documentation and diversity of data specificity and representation across providers, health systems, and national surveys. We describe how activity and participation information can be more effectively captured, and how health informatics methodologies, including natural language processing (NLP), can enable automatically locating, extracting, and organizing this information on a large scale, supporting standardization and utilization with minimal additional provider burden. We examine the analytic requirements and potential challenges of capturing this information with informatics, and describe how data-driven techniques can combine with common standards and documentation practices to make activity and participation information standardized and accessible for improving patient care.RecommendationsWe recommend four specific actions to improve the capture and analysis of activity and participation information throughout the continuum of care: (1) make activity and participation annotation standards and datasets available to the broader research community; (2) define common research problems in automatically processing activity and participation information; (3) develop robust, machine-readable ontologies for function that describe the components of activity and participation information and their relationships; and (4) establish standards for how and when to document activity and participation status during clinical encounters. We further provide specific short-term goals to make significant progress in each of these areas within a reasonable time frame.

AB BackgroundMore than 40% of adults in Sub-Saharan Africa are unaware of their HIV status. HIV self-testing (HIVST) is a novel approach with a potential to increase uptake of HIV testing and linkage to care for people who test HIV positive. We explored HIV stakeholder's perceptions about factors that enable or deter the uptake of HIV self-testing and experiences of self-testing of adult users in Africa.MethodsThis systematic review of qualitative evidence included articles on qualitative studies published or made available between January 1998 to February 2018 on perspectives of key stakeholders, including HIV policymakers, HIV experts, health care providers, and adult men and women (18years and above) about factors that enable or deter the uptake of HIV self-testing and experiences of self-testing among adult users.We searched CINAHL, MEDLINE in Pubmed, EMBASE, AJOL, PsycINFO, Social Science Citation Index (SSCI), and Web of Science for articles in English on HIVST with qualitative data from different African countries.ResultsIn total, 258 papers were retrieved, and only nine (9) studies conducted in 5 African countries were eligible and included in this synthesis.Perceived facilitators of the uptake of HIVST were autonomy and self-empowerment, privacy, confidentiality, convenience, opportunity to test, including couples HIV testing, and ease of use. The perceived barriers included the cost of buying self-test kits, perceived unreliability of test results, low literacy, fear and anxiety of a positive test result, and potential psychological and social harms. HIV stakeholder's concerns about HIVST included human right issues, lack of linkage to care, lack of face-to-face counseling, lack of regulatory and quality assurance systems, and quality of self-test kits. Actual HIVST users expressed preference of oral-fluid self-testing because of ease of use, and that it is less invasive and painless compared to finger-stick/whole blood-based HIV tests. Lack of clear instructions on how to use self-test kits, and existing different products of HIVST increases rates of user errors.ConclusionsOvercoming factors that may deter HIV testing, and HIVST, in particular, is complex and challenging, but it has important implications for HIV stakeholders, HIVST users, and public health in general. Research is warranted to explore the actual practices related to HIVST among different populations in Africa.

AB BackgroundOccupational stressors in police work increase the risk for officer mental health morbidities. Officers' poor mental wellbeing is harmful to the individual, can affect professionalism, organisational effectiveness, and public safety. While the impact of operational stressors on officers' mental wellbeing is well documented, no review has systematically investigated organisational stressor impacts. This study aimed to conduct a systematic review to assess the relationship between organisational stressors and police officer mental wellbeing.MethodsSystematic review conducted following PRISMA and Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. Literature search was undertaken from 1990 to May 2017 on four databases (EBSCOHOST Medline/SocINDEX/PsycINFO/OVID Embase) and grey literature. Included articles were critically appraised and assessed for risk of bias. Narrative and evidence syntheses were performed by specific mental health outcomes.ResultsIn total, 3571 results were returned, and 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. All included studies were published in English between 1995 and 2016, had cross-sectional study designs, spanned across four continents and covered 15,150 officers. Strong evidence of significant associations was identified for organisational stressors and the outcomes of: occupational stress, psychiatric symptoms/psychological distress, emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment. The organisational stressors most often demonstrating consistently significant associations with mental health outcomes included lack of support, demand, job pressure, administrative/organisational pressure and long working-hours.ConclusionsThis review is the first to systematically examine organisational stressors and mental health in police officers. Organisational stressors that can be targeted by interventions and policy changes to secure officer wellbeing, a healthy work environment, and benefits to the organisation and the public are identified.

AB Background Poor job conditions and limited resources are reducing job satisfaction and motivation among nurses in low-income countries, which may affect the quality of services and attrition rates. The objective of this study was to examine job satisfaction, motivation and associated factors among nurses working in the public health facilities of Ethiopia, with the aim of improving performance and productivity in the health care system. Methods The study employed a cross-sectional two-stage cluster sampling design. From a random sample of 125 health facilities, 424 nurses were randomly selected for face-to-face interviews in all regions of Ethiopia. Nurses responded to questions about their overall job satisfaction and job conditions, including items related to intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, using a 5-point Likert scale. Multilevel analysis was performed to adjust for different clustering effects. Satisfaction levels (percent of respondents who were satisfied) were calculated for individual items, and composite mean scores (range: 1-5) were calculated for motivational factors. Adjusted odds ratios were computed to examine the association of these factors with overall job satisfaction. Results Overall, 60.8% of nurses expressed satisfaction with their job. Composite mean scores for intrinsic and extrinsic motivational factors were 3.5 and 3.0, respectively. Job satisfaction levels were significantly higher for female nurses (65.6%, p = 0.04), those older than 29 years (67.8%, p = 0.048) and had over 10 years work experiences (68.8%, p = 0.007). Satisfaction with remuneration (AOR = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.36, 3.06), recognition (AOR = 2.21; 95% CI = 1.38, 3.53), professional advancement (AOR = 1.54; 95% CI = 1.06, 2.29), features of the work itself (AOR = 1.65; 95% CI = 1.20, 2.91) and nurses' work experiences from 5 to 10 years (AOR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.17, 0.79) were significantly associated with overall job satisfaction after controlling for other predictors. Conclusions The study findings are signals for the Ministry of Health to strengthen the human resource management system and practices to improve nurses' overall job satisfaction and motivation, especially among nurses with 5 to 10 years of experience on the job. Expanded recognition systems and opportunities for advancement are required to increase nurses' job satisfaction and motivation. Equitable salary and fringe benefits are also needed to reduce their dissatisfaction with the job.

AB Backgrounds Tooth loss is one of the major oral health problems among older Thai people. However, there is the existence of socioeconomic-related inequalities in dental service utilization, especially denture service. The aim of this study was to assess the determinants associated with inequalities in denture service utilization among older Thai people using the Andersen Behavioural model. Method This cross-sectional study involved secondary data analysis of the 2014 survey of older Thai people (N = 38,695). The dependent variable was a public denture service utilization over the past 5 years. Determinants were classified as predisposing and enabling factors. Predisposing variables included age, sex, education, economic condition and dependency status. Enabling variables included working status, health behaviours, health care utilization experience and social/community support. Data were analysed by using bivariate and multivariable analyses at alpha = 0.05. For bivariate analysis, chi-square test was used to determine the association between dependent and each independent variable. Then, all variables were incorporated into a multivariable binary logistic regression. Results The odds of denture service utilization were significantly higher for individuals who were older, female, and had a higher educational level and health-promoting behaviors. A positive dose-response relationship was demonstrated between denture service utilization and increased quartile of household assets. Conclusions Predisposing variables had a greater impact than enabling variables in denture service utilization among older Thai people. Despite free public denture service, socioeconomic-related inequalities persist. The government needs to reduce socioeconomic disparities to improve denture treatment inequality.

AB Background The Floresco integrated service model was designed to address the fragmentation of community mental health treatment and support services. Floresco was established in Queensland, Australia, by a consortium of non-government organisations that sought to partner with general practitioners (GPs), private mental health providers and public mental health services to operate a 'one-stop' mental health service hub. Methods We conducted an independent mixed-methods evaluation of client outcomes following engagement with Floresco (outcome evaluation) and factors influencing service integration (process evaluation). The main data sources were: (1) routinely-collected Recovery Assessment Scale - Domains and Stages (RAS-DS) scores at intake and review (n = 108); (2) RAS-DS scores, mental health inpatient admissions and emergency department (ED) presentations among clients prospectively assessed at intake and six-month follow-up (n = 37); (3) semi-structured interviews with staff from Floresco, consortium partners, private practitioners and the local public mental health service (n = 20); and (4) program documentation. Results Interviews identified staff commitment, co-location of services, flexibility in problem-solving, and anecdotal evidence of positive client outcomes as important enablers of service integration. Barriers to integration included different organisational practices, difficulties in information-sharing and in attracting and retaining GPs and private practitioners, and systemic constraints on integration with public mental health services. Of 1129 client records, 108 (9.6%) included two RAS-DS measurements, averaging 5 months apart. RAS-DS 'total recovery' scores improved significantly (M = 63.3%, SD = 15.6 vs. M = 69.2%, SD = 16.1; p < 0.001), as did scores on three of the four RAS-DS domains ('Looking forward', p < 0.001; 'Mastering my illness', p < 0.001; and 'Connecting and belonging', p = 0.001). Corresponding improvements, except in 'Connecting and belonging', were seen in the 37 follow-up study participants. Decreases in inpatient admissions (20.9% vs. 7.0%), median length of inpatient stay (8 vs. 3 days), ED presentations (34.8% vs. 6.3%) and median duration of ED visits (187 vs. 147 min) were not statistically significant. Conclusions Despite the lack of a control group and small follow-up sample size, Floresco's integrated service model showed potential to improve client outcomes and reduce burden on the public mental health system. Horizontal integration of non-government and private services was achieved, and meaningful progress made towards integration with public mental health services.

AB Background In Asia, over 50% of patients with symptoms of tuberculosis (TB) access health care from private providers. These patients are usually not notified to the National TB Control Programs, which contributes to low notification rates in many countries. Methods From January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2012, Karachi's Indus Hospital - a private sector partner to the National TB Programme - engaged 80 private family clinics in its catchment area in active case finding using health worker incentives to increase notification of TB disease. The costs incurred were estimated from the perspective of patients, health facility and the program providing TB services. A Markov decision tree model was developed to calculate the cost-effectiveness of the active case finding as compared to case detection through the routine passive TB centers. Pakistan has a large private health sector, which can be mobilized for TB screening using an incentivized active case finding strategy. Currently, TB screening is largely performed in specialist public TB centers through passive case finding. Active and passive case finding strategies are assumed to operate independently from each other. Results The incentive-based active case finding program costed USD 223 per patient treated. In contrast, the center based non-incentive arm was 23.4% cheaper, costing USD 171 per patient treated. Cost-effectiveness analysis showed that the incentive-based active case finding program was more effective and less expensive per DALY averted when compared to the baseline passive case finding as it averts an additional 0.01966 DALYs and saved 15.74 US$ per patient treated. Conclusion Both screening strategies appear to be cost-effective in an urban Pakistan context. Incentive driven active case findings of TB in the private sector costs less and averts more DALYs per health seeker than passive case finding, when both alternatives are compared to a common baseline situation of no screening.

AB Background Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing problem in hospitals world-wide. Following other countries, English hospitals experienced outbreaks of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), a bacterial infection commonly resistant to last resort antibiotics. One way to improve CPE prevention, management and control is the production of guidelines, such as the CPE toolkit published by Public Health England in December 2013. The aim of this research was to investigate the implementation of the CPE toolkit and to identify barriers and facilitators to inform future policies. Methods Acute hospital trusts (N = 12) were purposively sampled based on their self-assessed CPE colonisation rates and time point of introducing local CPE action plans. Following maximum variation sampling, 44 interviews with hospital staff were conducted between April and August 2017 using a semi-structured topic guide based on the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation and Behaviour Model and the Theoretical Domains Framework, covering areas of influences on behaviour. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. Results The national CPE toolkit was widely disseminated within infection prevention and control teams (IPCT), but awareness was rare among other hospital staff. Local plans, developed by IPCTs referring to the CPE toolkit while considering local circumstances, were in place in all hospitals. Implementation barriers included: shortage of isolation facilities for CPE patients, time pressures, and competing demands. Facilitators were within hospital and across-hospital collaborations and knowledge sharing, availability of dedicated IPCTs, leadership support and prioritisation of CPE as an important concern. Participants using the CPE toolkit had mixed views, appreciating its readability and clarity about patient management, but voicing concerns about the lack of transparency on the level of evidence and the practicality of implementation. They recommended regular updates, additional clarifications, tailored information and implementation guidance. Conclusions There were problems with the awareness and implementation of the CPE toolkit and frontline staff saw room for improvement, identifying implementation barriers and facilitators. An updated CPE toolkit version should provide comprehensive and instructive guidance on evidence-based CPE prevention, management and control procedures and their implementation in a modular format with sections tailored to hospitals' CPE status and to different staff groups.

AB Background Early and unprotected sex with multiple partners among adolescents carries a high risk of acquiring HIV infections, other sexually transmitted infections as well as high rates of teenage pregnancy. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has a higher burden of HIV/AIDS: the leading cause of deaths among adolescents. We estimated the prevalence and examined the correlates of sexual intercourse among in-school adolescents of SSA. The purpose is to inform the public health programs dedicated to tackling the burden of HIV/AIDS. Methods We did a secondary analysis of the Global School-based Student Health Surveys (GSHS) datasets pooled from five SSA countries Benin, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, and Tanzania. Our current analysis included a sample of 15,318 in-school adolescents. The primary independent variables were ever had sexual intercourse and sex with multiple partners, while the dependent variables were smoking cigarettes, alcohol use, use of marijuana and amphetamine, and parental connectedness. We performed descriptive statistics, and multivariate logistic regression stratified by gender using SPSS Complex Sample Statistics. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant at 95% confidence intervals. Results Out of 15,318 participants, the overall prevalence of ever had sexual intercourse and sex with multiple partners were 43 center dot 5% (6670) and 20 center dot 9% (3204), respectively. In overall and across each country, male adolescents had a significantly higher proportion of sex with multiple partners than female adolescents, p < 0 center dot 001. The predictors of sexual intercourse with multiple partners in both male and females were smoking cigarettes, alcohol use, and use of marijuana and amphetamine. Female adolescents who smoked cigarettes and used marijuana had a significant likelihood of sex with multiple partners than male adolescents: [aOR 3.6, 95% CI: 2.6-5.1] vs [aOR 2.1, 95% CI: 1.7-2.7] and [aOR 2.4, 95% CI: 1.6-3.7] vs [aOR 1.9, 95% CI: 1 center dot 3-2 center dot 7], respectively. Conclusions Adolescents sexual intercourse and more especially sex with multiple partners was prevalent and strongly correlated with substance use. However, the correlation was higher among female adolescents than male adolescents. A customized public health intervention that targets multiple risk factors concurrently may benefit adolescents with clustering of sexual and non-sexual risk-taking behaviors.

TI Maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response in Ethiopia:
   Achievements, challenges and prospects
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) was a pilot program introduced in Tigray, Ethiopia to monitor maternal and perinatal death. However; its implementation and operation is not evaluated yet. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the implementation and operational status and determinants of MPDSR using a programmatic data and stakeholders involved in the program.
   Methods
   Institutional based cross-sectional study was applied in public health facilities (75 health posts, 50 health centers and 16 hospitals) using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Data were entered in to Epi-info and then transferred to SPSS version 21 for analysis. All variables with a p-value of <= 0.25 in the bivariate analysis were included in to multivariable logistic regression model to identify the independent predictors. For the qualitative part, manual thematic content analysis was done following data familiarization (reading and rereading of the transcripts).
   Results
   In this study, only 34 (45.3%) of health posts were practicing early identification and notification of maternal/perinatal death. Furthermore, only 36 (54.5%) and 35(53%) of health facilities were practiced good quality of death review and took proper action respectively following maternal/perinatal deaths. Availability of three to four number of Health Extension Workers (HEWs) (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 6.09, 95%CI (Confidence Interval): 1.51-24.49), availability of timely Public Health Emergency Management (PHEM) reports (AOR = 4.39, 95%CI: 1.08-17.80) and participation of steering committee's in death response (AOR = 9.19, 95%CI: 1.31-64.34) were the predictors of early identification and notification of maternal and perinatal death among health posts. Availability of trained nurse (AOR = 3.75, 95%CI: 1.08-12.99) and health facility's head work experience (AOR = 3.70, 95%CI: 1.04-13.22) were also the predictors of quality of death review among health facilities. Furthermore; availability of at least one cluster review meeting (AOR = 4.87, 95%CI: 1.30-18.26) and uninterrupted pregnant mothers registration (AOR = 6.85, 95%CI: 1.22-38.54) were associated with proper response implementation to maternal and perinatal death. Qualitative findings highlighted that perinatal death report was so neglected. Community participation and intersectoral collaboration were among the facilitators for MPDSR implementation while limited human work force capacity and lack of maternity waiting homes were identified as some of the challenges for proper response implementation.
   Conclusion
   This study showed that the magnitude of: early death identification and notification, review and response implementation were low. Strengthening active surveillance with active community participation alongside with strengthening capacity building and recruitment of additional HEWs with special focus to improve the quality of health service could enhance the implementation of MPDSR in the region.

AB Seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii has been extensively studied in wild boars worldwide due to the emerging risk for human infection through meat consumption. However, this is the first study that reports toxoplasmosis seroprevalence in wild boars, wild boar hunters and their hunting dogs. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of anti-T. gondii antibodies in the complex wild boars, hunting dogs and hunters, and to determine the risk factors associated with seropositivity in southern and central-western Brazil. Overall, anti-T. gondii seropositivity was observed in 15/71 (21.1%) wild boars by modified agglutination test (MAT); and 49/157 (31.2%) hunting dogs and 15/49 (32.7%) hunters by indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT). Seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis in Brazilian wild boars was within the national and international range, posting wild boars as potential environmental sentinels for T. gondii presence. In addition, the findings have comparatively shown that wild boars have been less exposed to infection than hunting dogs or hunters in both Brazilian regions. Seropositivity for T. gondii was statistically higher in 12/14 (85.7%) captured wild boars when compared to 5/57 (7.0%) free-range wild boars (p = 0.000001). Similarly, captured wild boars from anthropized areas were more likely to be seropositive than of natural regions (p = 0.000255). When in multiple regression model, dogs with the habit of wild boar hunting had significant more chance to be positive (adjusted-OR 4.62 CI 95% 1.16-18.42). Despite potential as sentinels of environmental toxoplasmosis, seroprevalence in wild boars alone may provide a biased basis for public health concerns; thus, hunters and hunting dogs should be always be included in such studies. Although hunters should be aware of potential T. gondii infection, wild boars from natural and agricultural areas may present lower protozoa load when compared to wild boars from anthropized areas, likely by the higher presence of domestic cats as definitive hosts.

AB Background Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem in developing countries like Bangladesh. Female sex workers (FSWs) and their clients are active sources for spreading TB. The purpose of this study was to assess the knowledge of TB among FSWs in Rajshahi city, Bangladesh. Methods It was a cross-sectional study with a sample size of 225 FSWs. The knowledge on TB was measured by six different questions. Chi-square test and multinomial logistic regression model were used in this study to find the associated factors of lack of general knowledge on TB among FSWs. Results Out of 225 FSWs, 43.1, 34.7 and 22.2% came from urban, rural and slum areas respectively. More than 41% FSWs perceived that TB is a non-communicable disease. A large number of FSWs (76.4%) did not know the spread of TB. It was found that more than 90% FSWs did not have knowledge on latent TB. The chi(2)-test demonstrated that FSWs' education, monthly family income, age, currently marital status and sex trading place were significantly associated with their knowledge on TB. A remarkable number of FWSs (42.2%) had poor knowledge on TB. It was found that comparatively higher educated FWSs were more likely to have good or fair knowledge on TB than lower educated ones (p < 0.01). Conclusions This study revealed that near to half of FSWs in Rajshahi city, Bangladesh had poor knowledge on TB. Public health authorities should pay due attention and adopt policy for increasing the knowledge on TB among FSWs to reduce the incidence of TB in Bangladesh. Subsequently, advocacy, communication for social mobilization program is very urgent.

However, current theories on wellbeing are not well placed to inform this concern, because they fail to take account of and explain evidence on social determinants of mental health. Discussion This article proposes a new theory of public wellbeing which does takes account of such evidence, by explaining the role of stress within three basic functions of social cognition. Building on this description, the article then proposes that wellbeing consists in seven basic abilities, which are always developed and exercised (or not) through constant processes of interaction between individual and environment. The article explains why contemporary theories on wellbeing are poorly placed to inform public policy for wellbeing. It also positions the proposed theory in relation to evidence on social determinants of health (SDH) and the associated public policy agenda. It is argued the proposed theory of wellbeing extends on and challenges the SDH policy agenda in relation to the normative target of policy proposals, factors identified as determinants, impacts of determinants on populations, and proposals for political and social change. Conclusion Improved theory on public wellbeing can inform policy for wellbeing because it explains the contingent nature of wellbeing within contemporary social environments, and extends understanding of social determinants of wellbeing.

TI Physical fitness and physical self-concept of male and female young
   adults in Qatar
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SHUTTLE RUN TEST; CARDIORESPIRATORY FITNESS; GRIP STRENGTH;
   RISK-FACTORS; REPORT CARD; NORMATIVE VALUES; SCHOOL-CHILDREN; MORTALITY;
   OBESITY; WOMEN
AB Background
   Physical inactivity is high within the Qatari population, particularly within females, and school-based environments, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. Schoolbased physical activity (PA) outcomes may be mediated by physical self-concept. Low physical self-concept may negatively impact PA engagement, compromising childhood and adolescent physical fitness, which may translate into adulthood. Normative physical fitness data for the Qatari population is unavailable. Stratifying normative physical fitness appears prudent, to not only allow comparisons to be made worldwide, but enable informed decisions for public health policy and future interventions in the Qatari population.
   Purpose
   To establish the physical fitness of young adults in Qatar, and examine differences between males and females for physical self-concept, and engagement in school-based and extracurricular PA.
   Method
   186 (females n = 85) healthy participants [median (minimum-maximum) age: males = 21 (18-26), females = 21 (18-24) y; height: males = 1.74 (1.57-1.99), females = 1.61 (1.46-1.76) m; body mass: males = 71.9 (49.3-145.0), females = 56.8 (35.7-96.4) kg] completed the ALPHA-FIT test battery for adults (one leg stand, figure of eight run, handgrip strength, jump and reach, modified push-up, dynamic sit-up and 2 km walk), physical self-description questionnaire (measuring physical self-concept), and were asked to answer 'yes' or 'no' to whether they participated in school-based and extra-curricular PA.
   Results
   Data is reported as effect size; +/- 90% confidence limit. Males compared to females most likely performed better for dynamic sit-up (2.2; +/- 0.76), very likely better for the figure of eight run (0.86; +/- 0.42) and likely better for handgrip strength (2.1; +/- 0.75). Males likely had higher physical self-concept for coordination (0.78; +/- 0.37) and endurance (0.66; +/- 0.27) compared to females. There were no differences for school-based PA (p >= 0.78) or for extra-curricular PA for males (p >= 0.26) or females (p >= 0.21).
   Conclusion
   The data suggests that the young Qatari adult population has variable, yet generally low, physical fitness traits compared to individuals worldwide, likely due to their low PA. The precise aetiology for this is not well documented, yet such data may be prudent to evidence-inform strategies to improve physical fitness through increased PA (synergistic relationship), given the strong association between physical activity/fitness and morbidity/mortality.

TI Clinical experiences with the use of oxytocin injection by healthcare
   providers in a southwestern state of Nigeria: A cross-sectional study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a leading cause of maternal mortality in Nigeria and in most low- and middle-income countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) strongly recommends oxytocin as effective, affordable, and the safest drug of first choice in the prevention and treatment of PPH in the third stage of labor. However, there are concerns about its quality. Very high prevalence of poor-quality oxytocin, especially in Africa and Asia, has been reported in literature. Excessive and inappropriate use of oxytocin is also common in low-resource settings.
   Objective
   To assess clinical experiences with quality of oxytocin used by healthcare providers in Lagos State, Nigeria.
   Methods
   This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted in 2017, with 705 respondents (doctors and nurses) who use oxytocin for obstetrics and gynecological services recruited from 195 health facilities (public and registered private) across Lagos State. Data collection was quantitative, using a pretested self-administered questionnaire. Data analysis was performed with IBM SPSS version 21. Statistical significance was set at 5 percent (p<0.05). Ethical approval was obtained from Lagos University Teaching Hospital Health Research Ethics Committee.
   Results
   Only 52 percent of the respondents knew oxytocin should be stored at 2 degrees C to 8 degrees C. About 80 percent of respondents used oxytocin for augmentation of labor, 68 percent for induction of labor, 51 percent for stimulation of labor, and 78 percent for management of PPH. Forty-one percent used 20IU and as much as 10% used 30IU to 60IU for management of PPH. About 13 percent of respondents reported believing they had used an ineffective brand of oxytocin in their practice. Just over a third (36%) had an available means of documenting or reporting perceived ineffectiveness of drugs in their facility; of these, only about 12 percent had pharmacovigilance forms in their facilities to report the ineffectiveness.
   Conclusion
   The inappropriate and inconsistent use of oxytocin, especially overdosing, likely led to the high perception of medicine effectiveness among respondents. This is coupled with lack of suspicion of medicine ineffectiveness by clinicians as a possible root cause of poor treatment response or disease progression. Poor knowledge of oxytocin storage and consequent poor storage practices could have contributed to the ineffectiveness reported by some respondents. It is necessary to establish a unified protocol for oxytocin use that is strictly complied with. Continuous training of healthcare providers in medicine safety monitoring is advocated.

TI Access to unauthorized hepatitis C generics: Perception and knowledge of
   physicians, pharmacists, patients and non-healthcare professionals
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID BIOEQUIVALENCE; FLEXIBILITIES; MEDICINES; TABLETS
AB Objectives
   Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes both acute and chronic infection, which can potentially develop into cirrhosis and liver cancer. Healthcare systems are struggling to finance costly direct-acting antiviral agents through public funding for uninsured patients, despite the unprecedented high cure rates of these agents. Vulnerable populations are at higher risk of HCV infection. The personal importation scheme is based on the legal right to import any unauthorized generics for personal use. This study was designed to assess the knowledge and perceptions of stakeholders on unauthorized generics.
   Methods
   We conducted an anonymous online survey based on the fictitious situation of a patient diagnosed with HCV who lacked mandatory health insurance and personal financial resources.
   Results
   We obtained a sample of 781 respondents: 445 physicians, 77 pharmacists, 51 patients and 207 non-healthcare professionals. We found that only 36% and 58% of respondents believe that the quality and efficacy, respectively, of unauthorized generics are equivalent to their corresponding brand. An overwhelming majority (98%) favoured quality control upon arrival, and 31% felt they could recognize fraudulent websites. A total of 79% expressed support for financial assistance for vulnerable patients, and support among physicians was 83%.
   Conclusions
   Overall, the limited knowledge of the efficacy and quality of unauthorized generics, despite evidence in peer-reviewed literature, contrasts with the overwhelmingly positive attitudes toward financial assistance for personal import. This finding emphasizes the need for clearer information on imported generics and the potential safety provided by buyers' club schemes to complete the WHO agenda of eradicating viral hepatitis by 2030 within otherwise excluded vulnerable populations.

TI A physiological dose of oral vitamin B-12 improves hematological,
   biochemical-metabolic indices and peripheral nerve function in B-12
   deficient Indian adolescent women
SO PLOS ONE

ID SUBACUTE COMBINED DEGENERATION; OFFSPRING BIRTH-WEIGHT; MICROBIOLOGICAL
   ASSAY; LACTOBACILLUS-CASEI; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; FOLATE; PREGNANCY;
   HOMOCYSTEINE; BRAIN; SUPPLEMENTATION
AB Background
   Vitamin B-12 deficiency is often considered synonymous with pernicious anemia, a rare condition in which severe malabsorption of the vitamin requires high-dose parenteral treatment. In developing countries such as India, inadequate dietary intake of B-12 due to sociocultural factors leads to widely prevalent asymptomatic low B-12 status. In this scenario, lower doses of oral B-12 may be effective, safer and more affordable.
   Objective
   To examine the effects of oral B-12 treatment at physiological doses on hematological and biochemical indices and peripheral nerve function in B-12 deficient rural Indian adolescent women.
   Methods
   Thirty-nine women with B-12 deficiency who were excluded from a community based B-12 supplementation trial (Pune Rural Intervention in Young Adolescents (PRIYA)) received oral B-12 2 mu g/day, either alone (n = 19) or with multiple micronutrients (UNIMAPP formula + 20gm milk powder, n = 20) for 11 months. Hematological indices, nutrients (B-12, folate), metabolites (homocysteine) and peripheral nerve function (SUDOSCAN, Impetomedical, Paris and sensory nerve conduction velocity (NCV) of median and sural nerves) were assessed at baseline and after 11 months of B-12 treatment.
   Results
   Results were similar in the two treatment allocation groups, which were therefore combined. At baseline, all women had B-12 concentration < 100pmol/L, 79% were anemic and 33% had macrocytosis, but none had neuropathy. After 11 months of treatment, B-12 levels increased, while folate did not change. The prevalence of anemia fell to 59% and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and plasma homocysteine concentrations decreased. Sudomotor nerve function in the feet improved by an average of 14.7%, and sensory conduction velocity in median and sural nerves increased by 16.2% and 29.4% respectively.
   Conclusion
   We document clinically beneficial effects of supplementation with a physiological dose of oral B-12 in asymptomatic rural Indian adolescent women with very low B-12 status. These findings support a public health approach to tackle the widely prevalent low B-12 status in young Indians.

TI Anemia and its associated factors among adult people living with human
   immunodeficiency virus at Wolaita Sodo University teaching referral
   hospital
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   In Sub-Saharan Africa, both HIV/AIDS and anemia have considerable public health problems. Anemia has an adverse effect on treatment outcome and it decreases the quality of life among adult HIV patients. This study was aimed to assess the prevalence of anemia and its associated factors among adult HIV positive patients in Wolaita Sodo University Teaching Referral Hospital.
   Method
   Institution based cross-sectional study was conducted at Wolaita Sodo University Teaching Referral Hospital from 01 October to December 30, 2016. A randomly selected 411 adult people living with the human immunodeficiency virus were included in the study. A pretested questionnaire was used to collect data. Variables with P-value <= 0.25 in the bivariable logistic regression model were taken into multivariable logistic regression analysis along with 95% confidence interval and Odds Ratio was used to examine the association between anemia and independent variables. P-value <= 0.05 was taken as statistically significant.
   Result
   Prevalence of anemia in this study was 36.5% with 95% CI (32%-41%). Factors associated with anemia among adult people living with HIV/AIDS were individuals who lived with HIV >= 9 years (AOR = 2.6, 95% CI:-1.03-6.59),years lived with HIV 5-8 years (AOR = 2.59, 95% CI:-1.02-6.57),CD4 count < 200cells/ul (AOR = 4.2, 95%CI:-2.03-8.67), CD4 count200-350cells/ul(AOR = 1.82,95%CI:-1.01-3.26), infection with intestinal parasites (AOR = 2.04, 95% CI:-1.06-3.95), Participants with BMI < 18.5kg/m(2) (AOR = 2.96, 95%CI:-1.37-6.390), BMI 18.5-25kg/m(2)(AOR = 1.98, 95%CI:-1.11-3.56) and being HAART naive (AOR = 2.23, 95% CI:- 1.16-4.28).
   Conclusion
   Prevalence of anemia among this study participant was high. This may affect the treatment outcome, increases morbidity and mortality of the participants. So periodic screening of anemia, a routine checkup of nutritional status, CD4 count and examination for intestinal parasite are essential.

Economic disadvantages at the level of places and people, however, are themselves influenced by economic policies. To enhance the policy relevance of STI research, we explore, for the first time, the relationship between state-level minimum wage policies and STI rates among women in a cohort of 66 large metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the US spanning 2003-2015. Our annual state-level minimum wage measure was adjusted for inflation and cost of living. STI outcomes (rates of primary and secondary syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia per 100,000 women) were obtained from the CDC. We used multivariable hierarchical linear models to test the hypothesis that higher minimum wages would be associated with lower STI rates. We preliminarily explored possible socioeconomic mediators of the minimum wage/STI relationship (e.g., MSA-level rates of poverty, employment, and incarceration). We found that a $1 increase in the price-adjusted minimum wage over time was associated with a 19.7% decrease in syphilis rates among women and with an 8.5% drop in gonorrhea rates among women. The association between minimum wage and chlamydia rates did not meet our cutpoint for substantive significance. Preliminary mediation analyses suggest that MSA-level employment among women may mediate the relationship between minimum wage and gonorrhea. Consistent with an emerging body of research on minimum wage and health, our findings suggest that increasing the minimum wage may have a protective effect on STI rates among women. If other studies support this finding, public health strategies to reduce STIs among women should include advocating for a higher minimum wage.

TI Evaluating the foundations that help avert antimicrobial resistance:
   Performance of essential water sanitation and hygiene functions in
   hospitals and requirements for action in Kenya
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) in healthcare facilities is critical in the provision of safe and quality care. Poor WASH increases hospital-associated infections and contributes to the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). It is therefore essential for governments and hospital managers to know the state of WASH in these facilities to set priorities and allocate resources.
   Methods
   Using a recently developed survey tool and scoring approach, we assessed WASH across four domains in 14 public hospitals in Kenya (65 indicators) with specific assessments of individual wards (34 indicators). Aggregate scores were generated for whole facilities and individual wards and used to illustrate performance variation and link findings to specific levels of health system accountability. To help interpret and contextualise these scores, we used data from key informant interviews with hospital managers and health workers.
   Results
   Aggregate hospital performance ranged between 47 and 71% with five of the 14 hospitals scoring below 60%. A total of 116 wards were assessed within these facilities. Linked to specific domains, ward scores varied within and across hospitals and ranged between 20% and 80%. At ward level, some critical indicators, which affect AMR like proper waste segregation and hand hygiene compliance activities had pooled aggregate scores of 45 and 35% respectively. From 31 interviews conducted, the main themes that explained this heterogenous performance across facilities and wards included differences in the built environment, resource availability, leadership and the degree to which local managers used innovative approaches to cope with shortages.
   Conclusion
   Significant differences and challenges exist in the state of WASH within and across hospitals. Whereas the senior hospital management can make some improvements, input and support from the national and regional governments are essential to improve WASH as a basic foundation for averting nosocomial infections and the spread of AMR as part of safe, quality hospital care in Kenya.

TI Predictors, causes, and trends of neonatal mortality at Nekemte Referral
   Hospital, east Wollega Zone, western Ethiopia (2010-2014). Retrospective
   cohort study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   Neonatal mortality is a significant contributor to infant mortality. Causes and predictors of neonatal death are known to vary in different settings and across different contexts. This study aimed to assess predictors, causes, and trends of neonatal mortality amongst neonates admitted to Nekemte Referral Hospital neonatal unit between 2010-2014.
   Methods
   Retrospective data was collected for 2090 live born neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of Nekemte Referral Hospital by reviewing records between 2010 to 2014. Variables were collected from the neonatal registration book and patient card on the predictors, causes, and trends of neonatal death using a standard checklist developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). Data was analyzed using Epi info version 3.5.1, and SPSS version 25 for windows. The level of significance was set at P<0.05 with the corresponding confidence intervals at 95%. A logistic regression model was used for analysis and to control for confounders. Microsoft Excel 2007 was used to construct the trend analysis.
   Results
   There were 183 deaths in the cohort equivalent to 8.8% of deaths among total admitted neonates during the study period. Early neonatal deaths accounted for 8% and late neonatal deaths accounted for 0.71% of deaths among total admitted neonates. Main predictors identified for an increased risk of neonatal mortality were; neonates from rural residents [AOR 1.35, (95% CI, 1.35-1.87)], birth order of greater than five [AOR 5.10, (95% CI, 1.15-22.63)], home delivery [AOR 3.41, (95% CI, 2.24-5.19)], very low birth weight [AOR 6.75, (95% CI, 3.63-12.54)] and low birth weight [AOR 2.81, (95% CI, 1.95-4.05)] and inability to cry at birth [AOR 2.21, (95% CI, 1.51-3.22)]. The trend analysis showed a sharp fall for the neonatal mortality over the last five years with a mean reduction of 16%.
   Conclusions
   Data from the Nekemte Referral Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit analysis revealed majority of the deaths were occurred during early neonatal period. The main predictors of neonatal mortality identified from this study needs strengthening an appropriate public health intervention through addressing antenatal care, curbing home delivery.

AB Objectives
   Aging is associated with low muscle mass and has been linked to adverse health outcomes. The objectives of this cross-sectional study were: (1) to describe anthropometry, body composition, appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI; appendicular skeletal muscle mass/height(2)), and prevalence of low ASMI in older people with normal nutritional status (Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool score = 0); (2) to determine factors associated with ASMI, and odds ratios of having low ASMI.
   Methods
   SHIELD is a study of community-dwelling older people aged 65 years and above in Singapore. ASMI was determined using bioelectrical impedance analysis and low ASMI was defined as < 7.0 kg/m(2) for males and < 5.7 kg/m(2) for females (Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia, 2014).
   Results
   A total of 400 older people (183 males and 217 females) took part in this study. The overall prevalence of low ASMI was 20.6% (15.5% in males and 24.9% in females). Females had significantly lower ASMI than males (P < 0.0001), age was inversely associated with ASMI (P = 0.0024) while BMI and calf circumference were positively associated with ASMI (both P < 0.0001) in the total cohort. In addition, ASMI was positively associated with bone mass in both genders (both P < 0.0001). After adjusting for covariates, the odds ratios of having low ASMI with every 1 year and 10 years increase in age were 1.13 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.20) and 3.36 (95% CI: 1.82, 6.21) respectively.
   Conclusions
   The high prevalence of low ASMI in community-dwelling older people with normal nutritional status highlights the need for early screening. There was a strong inverse association between age and ASMI while BMI, calf circumference and bone mass were positively associated with ASMI. These findings will give further weight to the importance and development of public health strategies in maintaining and improving muscle health in this population group.

AB Aquaculture of bivalve shellfish and seaweed represents a global opportunity to simultaneously advance coastal ecosystem recovery and provide substantive benefits to humanity. To identify marine ecoregions with the greatest potential for development of shellfish and seaweed aquaculture to meet this opportunity, we conducted a global spatial analysis using key environmental (e.g., nutrient pollution status), socioeconomic (e.g., governance quality), and human health factors (e.g., wastewater treatment prevalence). We identify a substantial opportunity for strategic sector development, with the highest opportunity marine ecoregions for shellfish aquaculture centered on Oceania, North America, and portions of Asia, and the highest opportunity for seaweed aquaculture distributed throughout Europe, Asia, Oceania, and North and South America. This study provides insights into specific areas where governments, international development organizations, and investors should prioritize new efforts to drive changes in public policy, capacity-building, and business planning to realize the ecosystem and societal benefits of shellfish and seaweed aquaculture.

AB Background Musculoskeletal injury, including fracture, is one of the most common causes of morbidity in pediatric patients. The purpose of this epidemiologic study is to determine the prevalence and risk factors for fracture in a large cohort of pediatric patients under the age of 5. Results Of the 233,869 patients included in the study, 13,698 fractures were identified in 10,889 patients. The highest annual incidence was in the 4 year old age group with a rate of 24.2 fractures per 1000 children. The annual incidence within all age groups was 11.7 fractures per 1000 children. The two most common fractures were forearm and humerus fractures. Fracture incidence was increased in male children, patients who live outside the US, and in Caucasian patients. An increase in rate of fracture was also identified in children of officers when compared with children of enlisted service members. There were 35 abuse related fractures in our cohort, with 19 of them occurring in children less than 1 year old. Only three children in our cohort had Osteogenesis Imperfecta. Conclusion Fractures are common injuries in young children with an incidence over the first 5 years of life of 5.86%. Multiple risk factors were also identified including age, race, geographic location and socioeconomic status. The results of this study are an important contribution to epidemiologic and public health literature and serve to characterize the incidence of and risk factors for sustaining an early childhood fracture.

ID ACUTE DIARRHEA; PREVENTION; TRIAL
AB Background
   The important role played by intestinal bacterial flora in human health has recently attracted public attention worldwide. Although yogurt is thought to help in preventing the onset of gastroenteritis, this property has rarely been examined in epidemiological studies.
   Method
   This study analyzed data obtained by the Japan Environment and Children's Study. From a dataset of 103,062 pregnancies, 82,485 were selected for this analysis. Dietary intake of fermented foods (yogurt and cheese) in 1-year-old infants was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire. Parent-reported physician-diagnosed gastroenteritis in early childhood was determined from a questionnaire conducted when the child was 1 year old.
   Result
   The incidence of gastroenteritis was significantly lower in infants who consumed yogurt >= 7 and 3-6 times/week than in infants who consumed yogurt < 1 time/week in crude models (n = 82,485) and after adjustment for covariates (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.78 [0.70-0.86] versus 0.82 [0.76-0.89], respectively; n = 65,051). Frequency of weekly cheese consumption was not associated with the incidence of gastroenteritis.
   Conclusion
   Consumption of yogurt, but not cheese, at 1 year of age was associated with a reduced risk of gastroenteritis. Further studies of this association, including interventional studies, are warranted.

TI Feasibility and effectiveness of electronic vs. paper partograph on
   improving birth outcomes: A prospective crossover study design
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID OBSTETRIC CARE; MANAGEMENT; LABOR
AB Background
   The partograph has been endorsed by World Health Organization (WHO) since 1994 which presents an algorithm for assessing maternal and foetal conditions and labor progression. Monitoring labour with a partograph can reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes such as prolonged labor, emergency C-sections, birth asphyxia and stillbirths. However, partograph use is still very low, particularly in low and middle income countries (LMICs). In Bangladesh the reported partograph user rate varies from 1.4% to 33.0%. Recently, an electronic version of the partograph, with the provision of online data entry and user aid for emergency clinical support, has been tested successfully in different settings. With this proven evidence, we conducted and operations research to test the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing an e-partograph, for the first time, in 2 public hospitals in Bangladesh
   Methods
   We followed a prospective crossover design. Two secondary level referral hospitals, Jessore and Kushtia District Hospital (DH) were the study sites. All pregnant women who delivered in the study hospitals were the study participants. All nurse-midwives working in the labor ward of study hospitals were trained on appropriate use of both types of partograph along with standard labour management guidelines. Collected quantitative data was analyzed using SPSS 23 statistical software. Discrete variables were expressed as percentages and presented as frequency distribution and cross tabulations. Chi square tests were employed to test the association between exposure and outcome variables. Potential confounding factors were adjusted using multivariate binary logistic regression methods. Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional review board of the International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b).
   Findings
   In total 2918 deliveries were conducted at Jessore DH and 2312 at Kushtia DH during one-year study period. Of them, 1012 (506 in each facility) deliveries were monitored using partograph (paper or electronic). The trends of facility based C-section rates was downwards in both the hospitals; 43% to 37% in Jessore and from 36% to 25% in Kushtia Hospital. There was a significant reduction of prolonged labour with e-partograph use. In Kushtia DH, the prolonged labour rate was 42% during phase 1 with the paper version which came down to 29% during phase-2 with the e-partograph use. The similar result was observed in Jessore DH where the prolonged labour rate reduced to 7% with paper partograph from the reported 30% prolonged labour with e-partograph. The e-partograph user rate was higher than the paper partograph during both phases (phase 1: 3.31, CI: 2.04-5.38, p < .001 and in phase 2: 15.20 CI: 6.36-36.33, p < .001) after adjusting for maternal age, parity, gestational age, religion, mother's education, husband's education, and fetal sex
   Conclusion
   The partograph user rate has significantly improved with the e-partograph and was associated with an overall reduction in cesarean births. Use of the e-partograph was also associated with reduced rates of prolonged labour. This study has added to the growing body of evidence on the positive impact of e-partograph use. We recommend implementing e-partograph intervention at scale in both public and private hospitals in Bangladesh.

AB Introduction
   Ethiopian pharmaceutical sector has been facing inaccessibility and unaffordability to key essential medicines due to medicines diversion from the public to private health care facilities, lack of transparency, poor inventory management, and poor dispensing workflow. In an effort to improve the pharmaceutical sector, the government of Ethiopia in 2011 introduced Auditable Pharmaceutical Transactions and Services program. This study intended to compare drug use indicators in auditable and non-auditable primary level hospitals.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional comparative study was conducted between January 2018 and December 2018 at primary level hospitals in southern Ethiopia: one with Auditable Pharmaceutical Transactions and Services (APTS) program; another without APTS (Non-APTS). WHO drug use indicators in auditable primary hospitals (n = 10) and similar non-auditable primary hospitals (n = 10) were compared. The prescribing indicators and average cost of medicines were evaluated retrospectively using 1000 prescriptions from each group. Patient care indicators were evaluated prospectively by interviewing and observing 1000 patients from each group. Patient satisfaction was assessed by interviewing 1000 patients from each group. Health care facilities were evaluated through observation. We performed descriptive analysis, t-test, logistic regression, Mann-Whitney U test and linear regression using SPSS version 20.0.
   Results
   The mean consultation time in auditable and non-auditable hospitals was found to be 6.5 minutes and 3.46 minutes, respectively. The average dispensing time in auditable and non-auditable hospitals was found to be 6.6 minutes and 1.02 minutes, respectively. The proportion of drugs actually dispensed was 97.59% in APTS facilities and 76.44% in the non-audit able facilities with the lowest value seen in a non-auditable facility (51.65%). The average number of drugs per prescription was 2.32 (+/- 1.26) and 2.84 (+/- 1.17) in auditable and non-auditable facilities, respectively. The level of patient satisfaction on the convenience of pharmacy location, information on contraindications, availability of drugs and amount of time for counseling was significantly higher in the auditable facilities than the non-auditable facilities (p<0.001).
   Conclusions
   This study revealed that patient care indicator values, the level of patient satisfaction on the pharmacy services and health facility indicator values were significantly better in APTS than Non-APTS primary level hospitals. Most of prescribing indicators and labeling practices were not met WHO stated standard in both auditable and non-auditable facilities. This indicates that the auditable program should include additional strategies to reverse the existing irrational prescribing and inadequate labeling practices.

AB Background Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a rising public health problem and has attracted considerable attention worldwide. The purpose of this study was to develop an optimal model with meteorological factors to predict the epidemic of HFMD. Methods Two types of methods, back propagation neural networks (BP) and auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), were employed to develop forecasting models, based on the monthly HFMD incidences and meteorological factors during 2009-2016 in Jiangsu province, China. Root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were employed to select model and evaluate the performance of the models. Results Four models were constructed. The multivariate BP model was constructed using the HFMD incidences lagged from 1 to 4 months, mean temperature, rainfall and their one order lagged terms as inputs. The other BP model was fitted just using the lagged HFMD incidences as inputs. The univariate ARIMA model was specified as ARIMA (1,0,1)(1,1,0)(12) (AIC = 1132.12, BIC = 1440.43). And the multivariate ARIMAX with one order lagged temperature as external predictor was fitted based on this ARIMA model (AIC = 1132.37, BIC = 1142.76). The multivariate BP model performed the best in both model fitting stage and prospective forecasting stage, with a MAPE no more than 20%. The performance of the multivariate ARIMAX model was similar to that of the univariate ARIMA model. Both performed much worse than the two BP models, with a high MAPE near to 40%. Conclusion The multivariate BP model effectively integrated the autocorrelation of the HFMD incidence series. Meanwhile, it also comprehensively combined the climatic variables and their hysteresis effects. The introduction of the climate terms significantly improved the prediction accuracy of the BP model. This model could be an ideal method to predict the epidemic level of HFMD, which is of great importance for the public health authorities.

AB Background Intestinal schistosomiasis is highly endemic in Tanzania and mass drug administration (MDA) using praziquantel is the mainstay of the control program. However, the MDA program covers only school aged children and does not include neither adult individuals nor other public health measures. The Ijinga schistosomiasis project examines the impact of an intensified treatment protocol with praziquantel MDA in combination with additional public health interventions. It aims to investigate the feasibility of eliminating intestinal schistosomiasis in a highly endemic African setting using an integrated community-based approach. In preparation of this project, we report about baseline data on S.mansoni prevalence, intensity of infection, related hepatosplenic morbidities and their associated factors. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted among 930 individuals aged 1-95 years living at Ijinga Island, north-western Tanzania in September 2016. Single stool and urine samples were collected from each study participant and processed using Kato Katz (KK) technique and point-of-care Circulating Cathodic (POC-CCA) antigen test for detection of S.mansoni eggs and antigen respectively. Ultrasonographical examination for S.mansoni hepatosplenic morbidities was done to all participants. For statistical analyses Fisher's exact test, chi-square test, student-t-test, ANOVA and linear regression were used where applicable. Results Overall based on KK technique and POC-CCA test, 68.9% (95%CI: 65.8-71.8) and 94.5% (95%CI: 92.8-95.8) were infected with S.mansoni. The overall geometrical mean eggs per gram (GMepg) of faeces was 85.7epg (95%CI: 77.5-94.8). A total of 27.1, 31.2 and 51.9% of the study participants had periportal fibrosis (PPF-grade C-F), splenomegaly and hepatomegaly. Risk factors for PPF were being male (aRR = 1.08, 95%CI: 1.02-1.16, P < 0.01), belong to the age group 16-25 years (aRR = 1.23, 95%CI: 105-1.44, P < 0.01), 26-35 years (aRR = 1.42, 95%CI: 1.21-1.67, P < 0.001), 36-45 years (aRR = 1.56, 95%CI:1.31-1.84, P < 0.001) and >= 46 years (aRR = 1.64, 95%CI:1.41-1.92, P < 0.001). The length of the left liver lobe was associated with being female (P < 0.03), belong to the age group 1-5 years (P < 0.013), 6-15 years (P < 0.04) and S.mansoni intensity of infection (P < 0.034). Male sex (aRR = 1.15, 95%CI:1.06-1.24, P < 0.001) and belonging to the age groups 16-25 years (aRR = 1.27, 95%CI:1.05-1.54, P < 0.02) or 26-35 years (aRR = 1.32, 95%CI:108-1.61, P < 0.01) were associated with splenomegaly. Conclusion Schistosoma mansoni infection and its related morbidities (hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, periportal fibrosis) are common in the study area. Age, sex and intensity of infection were associated with periportal fibrosis. The prevalence of S.mansoni was above 50% in each age group and based on the observed prevalence, we recommend MDA to the entire community.

AB Background HIV molecular epidemiology is increasingly recognized as a vital source of information for understanding HIV transmission dynamics. Despite extensive use of these data-intensive techniques in both research and public health settings, the ethical issues associated with this science have received minimal attention. As the discipline evolves, there is reasonable concern that existing ethical and legal frameworks and standards might lag behind the rapid methodological developments in this field. This is a follow-up on our earlier work that applied a predetermined analytical framework to examine the perspectives of a sample of scientists from the fields of epidemiology, public health, virology and bioethics on key ethical issues associated with HIV molecular epidemiology in HIV network research. Methods Fourteen in-depth interviews were conducted with scientists from the fields of molecular epidemiology, public health, virology and bioethics. Inductive analytical approaches were applied to identify key themes that emerged from the data. Results Our interviewees acknowledged the potential positive impact of molecular epidemiology in the fight against HIV. However, they were concerned that HIV phylogenetics research messages may be incorrectly interpreted if not presented at the appropriate level. There was consensus that HIV phylogenetics research presents a potential risk to privacy, but the probability and magnitude of this risk was less obvious. Although participants acknowledged the social value that could be realized from the analysis of HIV genetic sequences, there was a perceived fear that the boundaries for use of HIV sequence data were not clearly defined. Conclusions Our findings highlight distinct ethical issues arising from HIV molecular epidemiology. As the discipline evolves and HIV sequence data become increasingly available, it is critical to ensure that ethical standards keep pace with biomedical advancements. We argue that the ethical issues raised in this study, whether real or perceived, require further conceptual and empirical examination.

AB Background Studies from Western countries reported a positive relationship between residential density (RD) and physical activity (PA) among adults. There was no such study from China, a rapidly-urbanizing country in the world. This study aimed to investigate the RD-PA association among urban adults in China. Methods A multistage sampling approach was used to randomly select participants (aged 35-74 years old) in urban areas of Nanjing in 2017. The outcome variable was PA (dichotomized into "sufficient" or "insufficient"), while the independent variable was RD (tertiled into three sub-groups). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed to examine the RD-PA association using mixed-effects logistic regression models with adjustment for age, sex, nationality, marriage, educational attainment, employment status, body weight status, green space and neighborhood-level clustering effects. Results Of the 1568 eligible participants, 1551 were interviewed (response rate = 98.9%), with the mean age (standard deviation) of 54.7 (11.1) years old, and 46% of men. After adjustment for potential confounders and community-level clustering effects, participants lived in communities with higher (OR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.21, 0.47) and middle (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.50, 0.99) residential density were significantly less likely to achieve sufficient physical activity relative to their counterparts lived in the lower densed communities. Similar negative RD-PA association was examined for men or women, separately. The difference in the ORs between the middle and higher RD tertiles was also statistically significant (P < 0.01). Conclusions A negatively gradient RD-PA association, independent of body weight status and green space, was observed among urban adults in regional China. It has public health implications for China to help residents' promote and maintain physical activity through planning and constructing PA-/health-friendly built environment in future.

AB Background
   Despite the well-recognised relevance of screening in colorectal cancer (CRC) control, adherence to screening is often suboptimal. Improving adherence represents an important public health strategy. We investigated the influence of family doctors (FDs) as determinant of CRC screening adherence by comparing each FDs practice participation probability to that of the residents in the same geographic areas using the whole population geocoded.
   Methods
   We used multilevel logistic regression model to investigate factors associated with CRC screening adherence, among 333,843 people at their first screening invitation. Standardized Adherence Rates (SAR) by age, gender, and socioeconomic status were calculated comparing FDs practices to the residents in the same geographic areas using geocoded target population.
   Results
   Screening adherence increased from 41.0% (95% CI, 40.8-41.2) in 2006-2008 to 44.7% (95% CI, 44.5-44.9) in 2011-2012. Males, the most deprived and foreign-born people showed low adherence. FD practices and the percentage of foreign-born people in a practice were significant clustering factors. SAR for 145 (21.4%) FDs practices differed significantly from people living in the same areas. Predicted probabilities of adherence were 31.7% and 49.0% for FDs with low and high adherence, respectively.
   Discussion
   FDs showed a direct and independent effect to the CRC screening adherence of the people living in their practice. FDs with significantly high adherence level could be the key to adherence improvement.
   Impact
   Most deprived individuals and foreigners represent relevant targets for interventions in public health aimed to improve CRC screening adherence.

AB Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) is a unique pattern of congenital abnormalities found in fetuses and neonates infected with the Zika virus (ZIKV). Here, we clinically identify and characterize infants with CZS between 2015 and 2018 in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil-a border area with Paraguay and Bolivia. This cross-sectional study, based on primary and secondary data, tracks the cases registered in the Brazilian Public Health Reporting System through the following stages: (1) preliminary data analysis, (2) identification of the congenital syndrome cases, (3) etiologic classification of the cases, (4) active search, and (5) clinical assessment. Of the 72 investigated cases, 16 were probable cases of CZS. Of these, it was only possible to clinically assess 11 infants. Considering the 16 probable cases of CZS, nine were classified as confirmed cases, and five as potential cases of the syndrome. Regarding clinical features, brain palsy was identified in all analyzed infants. Moreover, microcephaly and pseudobulbar syndrome were found in eight infants, and hydrocephalus was found in three individuals. In addition to these conditions, seven children were malnourished. Our study may provide significant insights for other researches that aim to elucidate CZS and its clinical and populational consequences.

AB High HIV incidence rates have been observed among pregnant and breastfeeding women in sub-Saharan Africa. Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) can effectively reduce HIV acquisition in women during these periods; however, understanding of its acceptability and feasibility in antenatal and postpartum populations remains limited. To address this gap, we conducted in-depth interviews with 90 study participants in Malawi and Zambia: 39 HIV-negative pregnant/breastfeeding women, 14 male partners, 19 healthcare workers, and 18 policymakers. Inductive and deductive approaches were used to identify themes related to PrEP. As a public health intervention, PrEP was not well-known among patients and health-care workers; however, when it was described to participants, most expressed positive views. Concerns about safety and adherence were raised, highlighting two critical areas for community outreach. The feasibility of introducing PrEP into antenatal services was also a concern, especially if introduced within already strained health systems. Support for PrEP varied among policymakers in Malawi and Zambia, reflecting the ongoing policy discussions in their respective countries. Implementing PrEP during the pregnancy and breastfeeding periods will require addressing barriers at the individual, facility, and policy levels. Multilevel approaches should be considered in the design of new PrEP programs for antenatal and postpartum populations.

AB Background Health care-related harm is an internationally recognized threat to public health. The United Kingdom's national health services demonstrate that upwards of 90% of health care encounters can be delivered in ambulatory settings. Other countries are transitioning to more family practice-based health care systems, and efforts to understand avoidable harm in these settings is needed. Methods We developed 100 scenarios reflecting a range of diseases and informed by the World Health Organization definition of 'significant harm'. Scenarios included different types of patient safety incidents occurring by commission and omission, demonstrated variation in timeliness of intervention, and conditions where evidence-based guidelines are available or absent. We conducted a two-round RAND / UCLA Appropriateness Method consensus study with a panel of family practitioners in England to define "avoidable harm" within family practice. Panelists rated their perceptions of avoidability for each scenario. We ran a k-means cluster analysis of avoidability ratings. Results Panelists reached consensus for 95 out of 100 scenarios. The panel agreed avoidable harm occurs when a patient safety incident could have been probably, or totally, avoided by the timely intervention of a health care professional in family practice (e.g. investigations, treatment) and / or an administrative process (e.g. referrals, alerts in electronic health records, procedures for following up results) in accordance with accepted evidence-based practice and clinical governance. Fifty-four scenarios were deemed avoidable, whilst 31 scenarios were rated unavoidable and reflected outcomes deemed inevitable regardless of family practice intervention. Scenarios with low avoidability ratings (1 s or 2 s) were not represented by the categories that were used to generate scenarios, whereas scenarios with high avoidability ratings (7 s 8 s or 9 s) were represented by these a priori categories. Discussion The findings from this RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method study define the characteristics and conditions that can be used to standardize measurement of outcomes for primary care patient safety. Conclusion We have developed a definition of avoidable harm that has potential for researchers and practitioners to apply across primary care settings, and bolster international efforts to design interventions to target avoidable patient safety incidents that cause the most significant harm to patients.

AB Introduction
   While Kedah has recorded the highest prevalence of diabetes among all the states in Malaysia, the information on the practice and effectiveness of disease management in public health institutions remains limited. This study aimed to evaluate the management and glycemic control of patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) at the primary care level in Kedah.
   Methods
   All T2DM patients, who made at least one visit to any of the 58 public health clinics in Kedah during August 2016 and July 2017, were included in this study. The sample was selected from the National Diabetes Registry using the stratified random sampling method. The information on the demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and pharmacological treatment was gathered from medical records of patients. The differences in mean HbA1C levels across subgroups of each variable were tested using the general linear model. The evaluation of the appropriateness of treatment was performed based on the recommendations of the latest Clinical Practice Guidelines for T2DM.
   Results
   The patients (n = 23,557) were mainly female (63.4%), of Malay ethnicity (80.1%) and middle-aged (62.2%), with a mean duration of T2DM of 6.2 +/- 7.16 years. Only 15.6% of them had a HbA1C level <6.5%, and 28.6% did not have their HbA1C levels tested over the 12-month period. Yet, the underutilization of combination treatment (>= 2 antidiabetic agents) and insulin in the patients with a poor glycemic control was evident. Retinopathy emerged as the most prevalent diabetes-related complication (12.6%). Along with those with a longer duration of T2DM, the patients who were younger, female and of Indian ethnicity were found to generally have a poorer glycemic control.
   Conclusion
   This study discloses the suboptimal T2DM management at the primary care level in Kedah, which warrants a statewide plan for improvement.

ID INFECTED PATIENTS
AB Background
   TB/HIV coinfection is a serious public health issue in Brazil, and patients with coinfection have difficulty adhering to treatments. Directly observed treatment (DOT) has been recommended by the World Health Organization, considering the vulnerability of those affected. The purpose is to investigate the occurrence of DOT and associated factors compared to conventional treatment in Porto Alegre, Brazil.
   Methods
   A retrospective cohort study was carried out with all patients with coinfection from 2009 to 2013 in the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil, the state capital with the highest rate of coinfection in Brazil. The data came from national health information systems. The dependent variable was the performance of DOT. Bivariate and multivariable models were used to determine factors associated with DOT. The percentage of cure and death was verified in a period of two years, comparing patients who received and did not receive DOT.
   Results
   2,400 cases of coinfection were reported, with 1,574 males and 826 females and a mean age of 38 years +/- 9.91 years. The occurrence of DOT was 16.9%. In the multivariable analysis, factors independently associated to DOT were the year (with greater chances of being received in 2012 and 2013), place of origin, non-white race (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.08-1.54), cases of relapse (OR = 1.33; 95% CI = 1.03-1.73), readmission after abandonment (OR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.20-1.83), transfer (OR = 2.04; 95% CI = 1.40-2.98), acid-fast bacilli (AFB) test with positive result in first sample (OR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.24-2.42), alcohol abuse (OR = 1.39; 95% CI = 1.16-1.67), and mental disorders (OR = 1.83; 95% CI = 1.38-2.44.) Of the 532 cases of death, occurring in two years, 10.2% were in patients who underwent DOT and 89.8% in patients who did not undergo DOT (p<0.001). O percentual de obitos em pessoas que receberam DOT foi de 13% e o percentual de obitos para pessoas que receberam tratamento convencional foi de 24%.
   Conclusions
   There was an increase in the percentage of DOT over the years in the scenario studied, and the predictors for DOT were related to social vulnerability. In relation to death within two years, a lower proportion was found in patients who underwent DOT, suggesting a protective effect of the strategy.

TI Effect of exclusive breastfeeding cessation time on childhood morbidity
   and adverse nutritional outcomes in Ethiopia: Analysis of the
   demographic and health surveys
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID INFANTS; GROWTH
AB Background
   Though exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for the first six months is recommended, it remains a debatable issue in both developed and developing countries. Thus, this study investigated the effect of EBF cessation time on childhood morbidity and adverse nutritional outcome in Ethiopia.
   Methods
   We used the 2011 and 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Surveys. The study involved 2,433 children under six months of age. Logistic regression model was applied to determine the effect of EBF cessation time on outcome variables. Population Attributable Fraction was calculated to evaluate the public health impacts of EBF termination in the population.
   Results
   Discontinuing EBF at 0-3 months (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08, 3.53)) and 4-6 months (AOR: 3.57, 95% CI: 2.19, 5.83) increased diarrhea occurrence compared to children who continued EBF up to 6 months. Children who had terminated EBF at 4-6 months had increased odds of fever (AOR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.11, 2.68) and acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs) (AOR: 2.74, 95% CI: 1.61, 4.65). Cessation of EBF earlier than 4 months or between 4-6 months was associated with increased odds of having at least one childhood morbidity. Termination of EBF at 0-3 months and at 4-6 months were associated with increased occurrence of wasting (AOR: 2.32, 95% CI: 1.45, 3.74) and underweight (AOR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.36, 3.91), respectively. Exclusive breastfeeding can avert 42% of diarrhea, 27% of ARI, 21% of fever, 26% of wasting and 23% of underweight burden among children under six months of age.
   Conclusions
   Termination of EBF before six months was associated with increased occurrence of diarrhea, fever and ARIs. It was also linked with increased occurrence of childhood wasting and underweight. The finding emphasized EBF for the first six months to reduce childhood morbidity and adverse nutritional outcomes.

TI Application of metagenomic shotgun sequencing to detect vector-borne
   pathogens in clinical blood samples
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID TOOLS
AB Background
   Vector-borne pathogens are a significant public health concern worldwide. Infections with these pathogens, some of which are emerging, are likely under-recognized due to the lack of widely-available laboratory tests. There is an urgent need for further advancement in diagnostic modalities to detect new and known vector-borne pathogens. We evaluated the utility of metagenomic shotgun sequencing (MGS) as a pathogen agnostic approach for detecting vector-borne pathogens from human blood samples.
   Methods
   Residual whole blood samples from patients with known infection with Babesia microti, Borrelia hermsii, Plasmodium falciparum, Mansonella perstans, Anaplasma phagocytophilum or Ehrlichia chaffeensis were studied. Samples underwent DNA extraction, removal of human DNA, whole genome amplification, and paired-end library preparation, followed by sequencing on Illumina HiSeq 2500. Bioinformatic analysis was performed using the Liver-more Metagenomics Analysis Toolkit (LMAT), Metagenomic Phylogenetic Analysis (MetaPhlAn2), Genomic Origin Through Taxonomic CHAllenge (GOTTCHA) and Kraken 2.
   Results
   Eight samples were included in the study (2 samples each for P. falciparum and A. phagocytophilum). An average of 27.5 million read pairs was generated per sample (range, 18.3-38.8 million) prior to removal of human reads. At least one of the analytic tools was able to detect four of six organisms at the genus level, and the organism present in five of eight specimens at the species level. Mansonella and Ehrlichia species were not detected by any of the tools; however, mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I amino acid sequence analysis suggested the presence of M. perstans genetic material.
   Conclusions
   MGS is a promising tool with the potential to evolve as a non-hypothesis driven diagnostic test to detect vector-borne pathogens, including protozoa and helminths.

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article

   UNITED-STATES; WEIGHT STATUS; HEALTH; CHILDREN; POLICY; FOOD; LAW
AB Introduction
   State lawmakers have explored numerous policy alternatives to reduce overweight and obesity. Evaluating effects of these laws is important but presents substantial methodological challenges. We present a conceptual framework that allows for classification of obesity prevention laws based on ecological level of influence and the underlying legal mechanism involved to guide analysis of the relationship between a substantial range of obesity prevention laws and BMI.
   Methods
   Obesity prevention laws (OPLs) for all 50 states and DC were obtained via primary legal research using the LexisNexis Advanced Legislative Services (ALS) database. For legal provisions that met inclusion criteria, reviewers abstracted information on bill state, citation, passage and effective dates, target population, and obesity prevention mechanism. Laws were categorized by ecological level of influence on weight-related behaviors and the legal mechanism utilized to change behavioral determinants of BMI.
   Results
   Laws designed to increase community-level opportunities for physical activity were the most frequently enacted OPL while laws designed to alter nutrition standards for school meals or competitive foods were comparatively less common, appearing in only 16% and 34% of states, respectively.
   Conclusion
   Prior studies of obesity policies have focused on specific interventions. We identified and categorized state-level laws that operate at all ecological levels and found that laws passed during the initial burst of lawmaking were largely confined to measures aimed at increasing opportunities for physical activity. Creating public spaces for recreation is an important step to promoting healthier lifestyles to reduce obesity risk; more comprehensive, multilevel legal approaches should also be pursued.

AB Introduction
   Metabolic risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) warrant significant public health concern globally. This study aims to utilise the regional database of a major laboratory network to describe the geographic distribution pattern of eight different cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRFs), which in turn can potentially generate hypotheses for future research into locality specific preventive approaches.
   Method
   A cross-sectional design utilising de-identified laboratory data on eight CMRFs including fasting blood sugar level (FBSL); glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c); total cholesterol (TC); high density lipoprotein (HDL); albumin creatinine ratio (ACR); estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR); body mass index (BMI); and diabetes mellitus (DM) status was used to undertake descriptive and spatial analyses. CMRF test results were dichotomised into 'higher risk' and 'lower risk' values based on existing risk definitions. Australian Census Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1) were used as the geographic units of analysis, and an Empirical Bayes (EB) approach was used to smooth rates at SA1 level. Choropleth maps demonstrating the distribution of CMRFs rates at SA1 level were produced. Spatial clustering of CMRFs was assessed using Global Moran's I test and Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA).
   Results
   A total of 1,132,016 test data derived from 256,525 individuals revealed significant geographic variation in the distribution of 'higher risk' CMRF findings. The populated eastern seaboard of the study region demonstrated the highest rates of CMRFs. Global Moran's values were significant and positive at SA1 level for all CMRFs. The highest spatial auto-correlation strength was found among obesity rates (0.328), and the lowest for albuminuria (0.028). LISA tests identified significant High-High (HH) and Low-Low (LL) spatial clusters of CMRFs, with LL predominantly in the less populated northern, central and southern regions of the study area.
   Conclusion
   The study describes a range of CMRFs with different distributions in the study region. The results allow generation of hypotheses to test in future research concerning location specific population health approaches.

AB Populations often encounter changed environments that remove selection for the maintenance of particular phenotypic traits. The resulting genetic decay of those traits under relaxed selection reduces an organism's fitness in its prior environment. However, whether and how such decay alters the subsequent evolvability of a population upon restoration of selection for a previously diminished trait is not well understood. We addressed this question using Escherichia coli strains from the long-term evolution experiment (LTEE) that independently evolved for multiple decades in the absence of antibiotics. We first confirmed that these derived strains are typically more sensitive to various antibiotics than their common ancestor. We then subjected the ancestral and derived strains to various concentrations of these drugs to examine their potential to evolve increased resistance. We found that evolvability was idiosyncratic with respect to initial genotype; that is, the derived strains did not generally compensate for their greater susceptibility by "catching up" to the resistance level of the ancestor. Instead, the capacity to evolve increased resistance was constrained in some backgrounds, implying that evolvability depended upon prior mutations in a historically contingent fashion. We further subjected a time series of clones from one LTEE population to tetracycline and determined that an evolutionary constraint arose early in that population, corroborating the role of contingency. In summary, relaxed selection not only can drive populations to increased antibiotic susceptibility, but it can also affect the subsequent evolvability of antibiotic resistance in an unpredictable manner. This conclusion has potential implications for public health, and it underscores the need to consider the genetic context of pathogens when designing drug-treatment strategies.

AB Citation data have remained hidden behind proprietary, restrictive licensing agreements, which raises barriers to entry for analysts wishing to use the data, increases the expense of performing large-scale analyses, and reduces the robustness and reproducibility of the conclusions. For the past several years, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Portfolio Analysis (OPA) has been aggregating and enhancing citation data that can be shared publicly. Here, we describe the NIH Open Citation Collection (NIH-OCC), a public access database for biomedical research that is made freely available to the community. This dataset, which has been carefully generated from unrestricted data sources such as MedLine, PubMed Central (PMC), and CrossRef, now underlies the citation statistics delivered in the NIH iCite analytic platform.

AB The United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) imposed a public access policy on all publications for which the research was supported by their grants; the policy was drafted in 2004 and took effect in 2008. The policy is now 11 years old, yet no analysis has been presented to assess whether in fact this largest-scale US-based public access policy affected the vitality of the scholarly publishing enterprise, as manifested in changed mortality or natality rates of biomedical journals. We show here that implementation of the NIH policy was associated with slightly elevated mortality rates and mildly depressed natality rates of biomedical journals, but that birth rates so exceeded death rates that numbers of biomedical journals continued to rise, even in the face of the implementation of such a sweeping public access policy.

AB Obesity traits are causally implicated with risk of cardiometabolic diseases. It remains unclear whether there are similar causal effects of obesity traits on other non-communicable diseases. Also, it is largely unexplored whether there are any sex-specific differences in the causal effects of obesity traits on cardiometabolic diseases and other leading causes of death. We constructed sex-specific genetic risk scores (GRS) for three obesity traits; body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and WHR adjusted for BMI, including 565, 324, and 337 genetic variants, respectively. These GRSs were then used as instrumental variables to assess associations between the obesity traits and leading causes of mortality in the UK Biobank using Mendelian randomization. We also investigated associations with potential mediators, including smoking, glycemic and blood pressure traits. Sex-differences were subsequently assessed by Cochran's Q-test (P-het). A Mendelian randomization analysis of 228,466 women and 195,041 men showed that obesity causes coronary artery disease, stroke (particularly ischemic), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, type 2 and 1 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic liver disease, and acute and chronic renal failure. Higher BMI led to higher risk of type 2 diabetes in women than in men (P-het = 1.4x10(-5)). Waist-hip-ratio led to a higher risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P-het = 3.7x10(-6)) and higher risk of chronic renal failure (P-het = 1.0x10(-4)) in men than women. Obesity traits have an etiological role in the majority of the leading global causes of death. Sex differences exist in the effects of obesity traits on risk of type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and renal failure, which may have downstream implications for public health.
   Author summary
   Obesity is increasing globally and has been linked to major causes of death, such as diabetes and heart disease. Still, the causal effects of obesity on other leading causes of death is relatively unexplored. It is also unclear if any such effects differ between men and women. Mendelian randomization is a method that explores causal relationships between traits using genetic data. Using Mendelian randomization, we investigated the effects of obesity traits on leading causes of death and assessed if any such effects differ between men and women. We found that obesity increases the risks of heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and chronic liver disease. Higher body mass index led to a higher risk of type 2 diabetes in women than in men, whereas a higher waist-hip ratio increased risks of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic kidney disease more in men than in women. In summary, obesity traits are causally involved in the majority of the leading causes of death, and some obesity traits affect disease risk differently in men and women. This has potential implications for public health strategies and indicates that sex-specific preventative measures may be needed.

AB Author summary Influenza, the flu, is a highly infectious respiratory disease that can cause serious health complications. Characterised by seasonal outbreaks, a key challenge for policy-makers is implementing measures to successfully lessen the public health burden on an annual basis. Seasonal influenza vaccine programmes are an established method to deliver cost-effective prevention against influenza and its complications. Transmission models have been a fundamental component of vaccine programme analysis, informing the efficient use of limited resources. However, these models generally treat each influenza season and each strain circulating within that season in isolation. By developing a mathematical model explicitly including multiple immunity propagation mechanisms, then fit to influenza-related vaccine and epidemiological data from England via statistical methods, we sought to quantify the extent that epidemiological events in the previous influenza season alter susceptibility at the onset of the following season. The findings suggest that susceptibility in the next season to a given influenza strain type is modulated to the greatest extent through natural infection by that strain type in the current season. Residual vaccine immunity has a lesser role. Prospectively, the adoption of influenza transmission modelling frameworks with immunity propagation would provide a comprehensive manner to assess the impact of seasonal vaccination programmes.
   Seasonal influenza poses serious problems for global public health, being a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality. In England, there has been a long-standing national vaccination programme, with vaccination of at-risk groups and children offering partial protection against infection. Transmission models have been a fundamental component of analysis, informing the efficient use of limited resources. However, these models generally treat each season and each strain circulating within that season in isolation. Here, we amalgamate multiple data sources to calibrate a susceptible-latent-infected-recovered type transmission model for seasonal influenza, incorporating the four main strains and mechanisms linking prior season epidemiological outcomes to immunity at the beginning of the following season. Data pertaining to nine influenza seasons, starting with the 2009/10 season, informed our estimates for epidemiological processes, virological sample positivity, vaccine uptake and efficacy attributes, and general practitioner influenza-like-illness consultations as reported by the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC). We performed parameter inference via approximate Bayesian computation to assess strain transmissibility, dependence of present season influenza immunity on prior protection, and variability in the influenza case ascertainment across seasons. This produced reasonable agreement between model and data on the annual strain composition. Parameter fits indicated that the propagation of immunity from one season to the next is weaker if vaccine derived, compared to natural immunity from infection. Projecting the dynamics forward in time suggests that while historic immunity plays an important role in determining annual strain composition, the variability in vaccine efficacy hampers our ability to make long-term predictions.

TI Estimating influenza incidence using search query deceptiveness and
   generalized ridge regression
SO PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID SURVEILLANCE; TIMELINESS
AB Author summary While often considered a minor infection, seasonal flu kills many thousands of people every year and sickens millions more. The more accurate and up-to-date public health officials' view of what the seasonal outbreak is, the more effectively the outbreak can be addressed. Currently, this knowledge is based on collating information on patients who enter the health care system. This approach is accurate, but it's also expensive and slow. Researchers hope that new approaches based on examining what people do and share on the internet may work more cheaply and quickly. Some internet activity, however, has a history of correspondence with disease activity, but this relationship is coincidental rather than informative. For example, some prior work has found a correspondence between zombie-related social media messages and the flu season, so one could plausibly build accurate flu estimates using such messages that are then fooled by the appearance of a new zombie movie. We tested flu estimation models that incorporate information about this risk of deception, finding that knowledge of deceptiveness does indeed produce more accurate estimates; we also identified a method to estimate deceptiveness. Our results suggest that estimation models used in practice should use information about both how inputs maps to disease activity and also what the potential of each input to be deceptive is. This may get us one step closer to accurate, reliable disease estimates based on internet data, which would improve public health by making those estimates faster and cheaper.
   Seasonal influenza is a sometimes surprisingly impactful disease, causing thousands of deaths per year along with much additional morbidity. Timely knowledge of the outbreak state is valuable for managing an effective response. The current state of the art is to gather this knowledge using in-person patient contact. While accurate, this is time-consuming and expensive. This has motivated inquiry into new approaches using internet activity traces, based on the theory that lay observations of health status lead to informative features in internet data. These approaches risk being deceived by activity traces having a coincidental, rather than informative, relationship to disease incidence; to our knowledge, this risk has not yet been quantitatively explored. We evaluated both simulated and real activity traces of varying deceptiveness for influenza incidence estimation using linear regression. We found that deceptiveness knowledge does reduce error in such estimates, that it may help automatically-selected features perform as well or better than features that require human curation, and that a semantic distance measure derived from the Wikipedia article category tree serves as a useful proxy for deceptiveness. This suggests that disease incidence estimation models should incorporate not only data about how internet features map to incidence but also additional data to estimate feature deceptiveness. By doing so, we may gain one more step along the path to accurate, reliable disease incidence estimation using internet data. This capability would improve public health by decreasing the cost and increasing the timeliness of such estimates.

AB Background Variations in thyroid function within reference ranges are associated with increased risk of diseases and death. However, the impact of thyroid function on life expectancy (LE) with and without noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) remains unknown. We therefore aimed to investigate the association of thyroid function with total LE and LE with and without NCD among euthyroid individuals. Methods and findings The study was embedded in the Rotterdam Study, a prospective population-based study carried out in the Netherlands. In total, 7,644 participants without known thyroid disease and with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels within reference ranges were eligible. NCDs were defined as presence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, or cancer. We used the demographic tool of multistate life tables to calculate LE estimates at the age of 50 years, using prevalence, incidence rates, and hazard ratios for three transitions (healthy to NCD, healthy to death, and NCD to death). The total LE and LE with and without NCD among TSH and FT4 tertiles were calculated separately in men and women. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors. The mean (standard deviation) age of the participants was 64.5 (9.7) years, and 52.3% were women. Over a median follow-up of 8 years (interquartile range 2.7-9.9 years), 1,396 incident NCD events and 1,422 deaths occurred. Compared with those in the lowest TSH tertile, men and women in the highest TSH tertile were expected to live 1.5 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8-2.3, p < 0.001) and 1.5 years (CI 0.8-2.2, p < 0.001) longer, respectively, of which 1.4 years (CI 0.5-2.3, p = 0.002) and 1.3 years (CI 0.3-2.1, p = 0.004) with NCD. Compared with those in the lowest FT4 tertile, the difference in LE for men and women in the highest FT4 tertile was -3.7 years (CI -5.1 to -2.2, p < 0.001) and -3.3 years (CI -4.7 to -1.9, p < 0.001), respectively, of which -1.8 years (CI -3.1 to -0.7, p = 0.003) and -2.0 years (CI -3.4 to -0.7, p = 0.003) without NCD. A limitation of the study is the observational design. Thus, the possibility of residual confounding cannot be entirely ruled out. Conclusions In this study, we found that people with low-normal thyroid function (i.e., highest tertile of TSH and lowest tertile of FT4 reference ranges) are expected to live more years with and without NCD than those with high-normal thyroid function (i.e., lowest tertile of TSH and highest tertile of FT4 reference ranges). These findings provide support for a re-evaluation of the current reference ranges of thyroid function.
   Author summaryWhy was this study done? Thyroid dysfunction is an important public health problem that is associated with an increased risk of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer. The diagnosis and treatment of thyroid dysfunction is based on thyrotropin and free thyroxine measurements. Accumulating evidence has suggested that the clinical consequences of thyroid dysfunction are extended even within the reference ranges of thyrotropin and free thyroxine levels. However, the impact of thyroid function on life expectancy with and without NCD remains unknown. What did the researchers do and find? We performed a large prospective population-based cohort study within the framework of the Rotterdam Study. We investigated the association of thyroid function with life expectancy with and without NCD among euthyroid individuals. We found that individuals with low-normal thyroid function live up to 3.7 years longer overall, of which up to 1.9 years longer with NCD, than individuals with high-normal thyroid function. What do these findings mean? Our study provides novel insights about the qualitative and quantitative impact of thyroid function on life expectancy. Our findings provide support for a re-evaluation of the reference ranges of thyroid function in middle-aged and older adults. This can have further implications on the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid disease.

TI Provision of postpartum care to women giving birth in health facilities
   in sub-Saharan Africa: A cross-sectional study using Demographic and
   Health Survey data from 33 countries
SO PLOS MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; MATERNAL MORTALITY; POSTNATAL CARE; COVERAGE
AB Author summaryWhy was this study done? Between 20% and 44% of maternal deaths in low-resource settings are estimated to occur in the postpartum period. Understanding the care women receive after giving birth in health facilities is increasingly important given that more than half of births in sub-Saharan Africa now occur in health facilities. This study was conducted because there is a gap in the evidence on the provision of care to women delivering in health facilities in low- and middle-income countries. What did the researchers do and find? We analyzed data from 137,218 women who recently delivered a live baby in a health facility in 33 sub-Saharan African countries and assessed the percentage of women who reported that a health professional checked on their health before they were discharged. We found that the percentage of women receiving checks before discharge varied widely across all countries (from 27% in Eswatini to 94% in Burkina Faso) and was far from universal in most countries. Women who had a cesarean section were more likely to have been checked, while women who delivered at lower-level public facilities (versus a public hospital) or with a nurse/midwife (versus a doctor) were less likely to have received a check. What do these findings mean? Our results highlight the need for a greater attention to the provision of high-quality postpartum care in facilities across sub-Saharan Africa if the currently high levels of maternal mortality are to be tackled effectively. One challenge of our study was the subjective definition of a health check and the three different ways women were asked to report this across all countries. The checks and the person who provided them were self-reported by women and are hence dependent on how accurately they understood and remembered the circumstances after their births. The main implication of our study is that the lack of postpartum checks, combined with the short time women tend to stay in health facilities after birth in sub-Saharan Africa, likely contributes to underdiagnosis and poor management of some birth complications such as postcesarean surgical site infection.
   Background Postpartum care has the potential to avert a substantial proportion of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. There is a crucial gap in understanding the quality of postpartum care for women giving birth in health facilities in low- and middle-income settings. This is particularly the case in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where the levels of maternal and neonatal mortality are highest globally despite rapid increases in facility-based childbirth. This study estimated the percentage of women receiving a postpartum health check following childbirth in a health facility in SSA and examined the determinants of receiving such check. Methods and findings We used the most recent Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) conducted in 33 SSA countries between 2000-2016. We estimated the percentage of women receiving a postpartum check by a health professional while in the childbirth facility and the associated 95% confidence interval (CI) for each country. We analyzed determinants of receiving such checks using logistic regression of the pooled data. The analysis sample included 137,218 women whose most recent live birth in the 5- year period before the survey took place in a health facility. Of this pooled sample, 65.7% of women were under 30 years of age, 85.9% were currently married, and 57% resided in rural areas. Across countries, the median percentage of women who reported receiving a check was 71.7%, ranging from 26.6% in Eswatini (Swaziland) to 94.4% in Burkina Faso. The most fully adjusted model showed that factors from all four conceptual categories (obstetric/neonatal risk factors, care environment, and women's sociodemographic and child-related characteristics) were significant determinants of receiving a check. Women with a cesarean section had a significantly higher adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 1.88 (95% CI 1.72-2.05, p < 0.001) of receiving a check. Women giving birth in lower-level public facilities had lower odds of receiving a check (aOR 0.94, 95% CI 0.90-0.98, p = 0.002) compared to those in public hospitals, as did women attended by a nurse/midwife (compared to doctor/nonphysician clinician) (aOR 0.74, 95% CI 0.69-0.78, p < 0.001). This study was limited by the accuracy of the respondent's recall of the provider, timing, and receipt of postpartum checks. The outcome of interest was measured using three slightly different question sets across the 33 included countries. Conclusions The suboptimal levels of postpartum checks in health facilities in many of the included SSA countries partially reflect the lack of importance given to postpartum care in the global discourse on essential interventions and quality improvement in maternal health. Addressing disparities in access to both facility-based childbirth and good-quality postpartum care in SSA is critical to addressing stalling declines in maternal mortality and morbidity.

   on a pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial

   EXERCISE; RESISTANCE; RADIATION; HEALTH
AB Background Physical exercise has been shown to be effective in relation to fatigue, aerobic fitness, and lower body strength in men with prostate cancer. However, research into the clinically relevant effects of interventions conducted in heterogeneous patient populations and in real-life clinical practice settings is warranted. Methods and findings We conducted a pragmatic, multicentre, parallel randomised controlled trial in 5 Danish urological departments. Recruitment began in May 2015, the first participant was randomised in June 2015, and the last participant was included in February 2017. In total, 214 men with prostate cancer were randomly assigned to either 6 months of free-of-charge football training twice weekly at a local club (football group [FG]) (n = 109) or usual care (usual care group [UG]) (n = 105), including brief information on physical activity recommendations at randomisation. Participants were on average 68.4 (SD 6.2) years old, 157 (73%) were retired, 87 (41%) were on castration-based treatment, 19 (9%) had received chemotherapy, and 41 (19%) had skeletal metastases at baseline. In this 1-year follow-up study, we evaluated the effects of community-based football training on the following outcomes: primary outcome, quality of life; secondary outcomes: continuation of football after 6 months, hip and lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD), mental health score, fat and lean body mass, and safety outcomes, i.e., fractures, falls, and hospital admissions. Intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses were conducted. No statistically significant between-group difference was observed in change in prostate-cancer-specific quality of life (ITT: 1.9 points [95% CI -1.9 to 5.8], p = 0.325; PP: 3.6 points [95% CI -0.9 to 8.2], p = 0.119). A statistically significant between-group difference was observed in change in total hip BMD, in favour of FG (0.007 g/cm(2) [95% CI 0.004 to 0.013], p = 0.037). No differences were observed in change in lumbar spine BMD or lean body mass. Among patients allocated to football, 59% chose to continue playing football after the end of the 6-month intervention period. At 1-year follow-up in the PP population, FG participants had more improvement on the Mental Component Summary (2.9 [95% CI 0.0 to 5.7], p = 0.048 points higher) than UG participants, as well as a greater loss of fat mass (-0.9 kg [95% CI -1.7 to -0.1], p = 0.029). There were no differences between groups in relation to fractures or falls. Hospital admissions were more frequent in UG compared to FG (33 versus 20; the odds ratio based on PP analysis was 0.34 for FG compared to UG). There were 3 deaths in FG and 4 in UG. Main limitations of the study were the physically active control group and assessment of physical activity by means of self-report. Conclusions In this trial, participants allocated to football appeared to have improved hip BMD and fewer hospital admissions. Men who played football more than once a week for 1 year lost fat mass and reported improved mental health. Community-based football proved to be acceptable, even when club membership was not subsidised.
   Author summaryWhy was this study done? Sports is often referred to as an applicable and useful public health strategy for promoting physical activity in clinical populations, but to our knowledge no randomised controlled trials have examined this possibility in sports clubs. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. Men with prostate cancer can suffer severe morbidity from medical treatments that possibly can be mitigated by exercising and being physical active. What did the researchers do and find? We carried out a pragmatic randomised controlled trial involving 214 men with prostate cancer. Participants were either offered football training in a local club or recommended to continue their active normal life, and were studied over 1 year. We found that more than half of participants allocated to football training continued with football in the club even when they had to pay their club membership fee themselves. In this setting, men with prostate cancer appeared to have improved hip bone density and were also admitted to hospital less frequently when allocated to a local football club. Playing football did not change men's scores of prostate-cancer-specific quality of life. The men who played football more than 1 time a week had improved mental health scores and lost fat mass. What do these findings mean? Clinicians can encourage men with prostate cancer to engage in local sports activities to mitigate some of the negative effects of medical treatments. Sports can be a strategy for some men with prostate cancer in substitution for other exercise. Our findings are limited by the setting the study was implemented in: Denmark is a country with a highly active population and many local football clubs.

   treatments-Translating international tuberculosis treatment guidelines
   into national strategic plans: Experiences from Belarus, South Africa,
   and Vietnam
SO PLOS MEDICINE

DT Article
ID STRENGTH; QUALITY; GRADE
AB The World Health Organization (WHO) plays an important role in setting global norms and standards with a focus on public health and publishes international guidelines regularly to support Member States, particularly ministries of health, in the provision of the highest standard of healthcare. Over the last 5 years, multiple advances in diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis (TB) have resulted in a number of new WHO guidelines for TB care, but these recent guidelines have not always been implemented in a timely fashion, raising issues in their adoption and scale-up at country level. We discuss the experiences of three countries with a high burden of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB)-Belarus, South Africa, and Vietnam-in implementing recent WHO guidelines on bedaquiline, a drug recently registered and recommended for the treatment of MDR-TB and the standardised shorter treatment regimen (STR) for MDR-TB. The process of adopting and implementing new guidelines requires national TB programmes (NTPs) to interact with multiple agencies: both intergovernmental departments and external agencies such as regulators and donors. These processes are country specific, but there are some generalised challenges that NTPs in high-burden countries experienced when implementing recent WHO MDR-TB guidance. With multiple trials of new regimens for MDR-TB and new classes of drugs in the clinical treatment pipeline, the frequency of new guidelines for TB is expected to increase, and it is important to support NTPs to implement and scale-up these new developments in treatment.

   confirm and support tuberculosis treatment adherence: A randomized
   controlled trial

ID INGESTIBLE SENSOR; RELAPSE; SYSTEM; REGIMENS; IMPACT
AB Author summaryWhy was this study done? TB is the infectious disease that kills the most people annually and is spread by droplets released into the air from persons with TB in their lungs. Multiple antibiotics taken over many months are necessary to cure this infection, and if doses are missed or full treatment is not completed, infected people can continue spreading the disease, and antibiotic resistance may occur. New methods to confirm that all the correct medication doses are taken and support patients over the long treatment course are crucial to saving lives and combatting disease spread. What did the researchers do and find? We tested a new FDA-approved technology that uses a sensor made of minerals that is swallowed with TB medication and subsequently records the ingestion on a cellphone. We tested the sensor system accuracy to identify ingestions and we also randomly assigned persons with TB to receive the new system or the standard of care currently available, directly observed therapy, for supporting and confirming medication taking during TB treatment for periods up to 29 weeks. We found the system was highly accurate and that persons using this system were confirmed as taking 93% of their daily prescribed doses as opposed to 63% using directly observed therapy. In this study, the difference observed was mainly driven by the ability of the system to confirm doses 7 days a week compared to only on working days for directly observed therapy. What do these findings mean? These findings indicate that novel sensor-based systems that use cell phones to remotely record digital data are as accurate as actually watching a person swallow their medications and can be used to confirm and support TB treatment 7 days a week, compared to 5 days a week for the current standard of care available. However, this technology still needs to be tested over the full course of TB treatment. WOT should be tested in high-burden TB settings, where it may substantially support LMIC TB programs.
   Background Excellent adherence to tuberculosis (TB) treatment is critical to cure TB and avoid the emergence of resistance. Wirelessly observed therapy (WOT) is a novel patient self-management system consisting of an edible ingestion sensor (IS), external wearable patch, and paired mobile device that can detect and digitally record medication ingestions. Our study determined the accuracy of ingestion detection in clinical and home settings using WOT and subsequently compared, in a randomized control trial (RCT), confirmed daily adherence to medication in persons using WOT or directly observed therapy (DOT) during TB treatment. Methods and findings We evaluated WOT in persons with active Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex disease using IS-enabled combination isoniazid 150 mg/rifampin 300 mg (IS-Rifamate). Seventy-seven participants with drug-susceptible TB in the continuation phase of treatment, prescribed daily isoniazid 300 mg and rifampin 600 mg, used IS-Rifamate. The primary endpoints of the trial were determination of the positive detection accuracy (PDA) of WOT, defined as the percentage of ingestions detected by WOT administered under direct observation, and subsequently the proportion of prescribed doses confirmed by WOT compared to DOT. Initially participants received DOT and WOT simultaneously for 2-3 weeks to allow calculation of WOT PDA, and the 95% confidence interval (CI) was estimated using the bootstrap method with 10,000 samples. Sixty-one participants subsequently participated in an RCT to compare the proportion of prescribed doses confirmed by WOT and DOT. Participants were randomized 2:1 to receive WOT or maximal in-person DOT. In the WOT arm, if ingestions were not remotely confirmed, the participant was contacted within 24 hours by text or cell phone to provide support. The number of doses confirmed was collected, and nonparametric methods were used for group and individual comparisons to estimate the proportions of confirmed doses in each randomized arm with 95% CIs. Sensitivity analyses, not prespecified in the trial registration, were also performed, removing all nonworking (weekend and public holiday) and held-dose days. Participants, recruited from San Diego (SD) and Orange County (OC) Divisions of TB Control and Refugee Health, were 43.1 (range 18-80) years old, 57% male, 42% Asian, and 39% white with 49% Hispanic ethnicity. The PDA of WOT was 99.3% (CI 98.1; 100). Intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis within the RCT showed WOT confirmed 93% versus 63% DOT (p < 0.001) of daily doses prescribed. Secondary analysis removing all nonworking days (weekends and public holidays) and held doses from each arm showed WOT confirmed 95.6% versus 92.7% (p = 0.31); WOT was non-inferior to DOT (difference 2.8% CI [-1.8%, 9.1%]). One hundred percent of participants preferred using WOT. WOT associated adverse events were <10%, consisting of minor skin rash and pruritus associated with the patch. WOT provided longitudinal digital reporting in near real time, supporting patient self-management and allowing rapid remote identification of those who needed more support to maintain adherence. This study was conducted during the continuation phase of TB treatment, limiting its generalizability to the entire TB treatment course. Conclusions In terms of accuracy, WOT was equivalent to DOT. WOT was superior to DOT in supporting confirmed daily adherence to TB medications during the continuation phase of TB treatment and was overwhelmingly preferred by participants.
   WOT should be tested in high-burden TB settings, where it may substantially support low- and middle-income country (LMIC) TB programs.

TI mHealth intervention "ImTeCHO" to improve delivery of maternal,
   neonatal, and child care services-A cluster-randomized trial in tribal
   areas of Gujarat, India
SO PLOS MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID MORTALITY; SURVIVAL; NEWBORN
AB Background The coverage of community-based maternal, neonatal, and child health (MNCH) services remains low, especially in hard-to-reach areas. We evaluated the effectiveness of a mobile-phone-and web-based application, Innovative Mobile-phone Technology for Community Health Operations (ImTeCHO), as a job aid to the government's Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) and Primary Health Center (PHC) staff to improve coverage of MNCH services in rural tribal communities of Gujarat, India. Methods and findings This open cluster-randomized trial was conducted in 22 PHCs in six tribal blocks of Bharuch and Narmada districts in India. The ImTeCHO mobile-phone-and web-based application included various technology-based job aids to facilitate scheduling of home visits, screening for complications, counseling during home visits, and supportive supervision by PHC staff. Primary outcome indicators were a composite index calculated based on coverage of important MNCH services and coverage of at least two home visitations by ASHA within the first week of birth. Primary analysis was intention to treat (ITT). Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) was used to account for clustering. Eleven PHCs each were randomly allocated to the intervention (280 ASHAs, population: 234,134) and control (281 ASHAs, population: 242,809) arms. The intervention was implemented from February, 2016 to January, 2017. At the end of the implementation, 6,493 mothers were surveyed. Most of the surveyed women were tribal (5,571, 85.8%), and reported having a government-issued certificate for living below poverty line (4,916, 75.7%). The coverage of at least two home visits within first week of birth was 32.4% in the intervention clusters compared to 22.9% in the control clusters (adjusted effect size 10.2 [95% CI: 6.4, 14.0], p < 0.001). Mean number of home visits within first week of birth was 1.11 and 0.80 for intervention and control clusters, respectively (adjusted effect size 0.34 [95% CI: 0.23, 0.45], p < 0.001). The composite coverage index was 43.0% in the intervention clusters compared to 38.5% (adjusted effect size 4.9 [95% CI: 0.2, 9.5], p = 0.03) in the control clusters. There were substantial improvements in coverage home visits by ASHAs during antenatal period (adjusted effect size 15.7 [95% CI: 11.0, 20.4], p < 0.001), postnatal period (adjusted effect size 6.4, [95% CI: 3.2, 9.6], p <0.001), early initiation of breastfeeding (adjusted effect size 7.8 [95% CI: 4.2, 11.4], p < 0.001), and exclusive breastfeeding (adjusted effect size 13.4 [95% CI: 8.9, 17.9], p < 0.001). Number of infant and neonatal deaths was similar in the two arms in the ITT analysis. The limitations of the study include potential risk of inaccuracies in reporting events that occurred during pregnancy by the mothers and the duration of intervention being 12 months, which might be considered short. Conclusions In this study, we found that use of ImTeCHO mobile- and web-based application as a job aid by government ASHAs and PHC staff improved coverage and quality of MNCH services in hard-to-reach areas. Supportive supervision, change management, and timely resolution of technology-related issues were critical implementation considerations to ensure adherence to the intervention.
   Author summaryWhy was this study done? Delivery of community-based maternal, neonatal, and child health (MNCH) services can improve health outcomes and reduce preventable infant deaths. To improve the coverage of proven MNCH services, a new cadre of village-based frontline workers, called Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs), was introduced by the government of India in 2005. However, the coverage and quality of MNCH services delivered by ASHAs remains low, especially in hard-to-reach tribal areas. Mobile-phone-technology-based health (mHealth) solutions are promising, innovative strategies with the potential to improve performance of frontline health workers in controlled settings. However, there is a lack of robust evidence about the effectiveness of mHealth solutions implemented within the public health system as a job aid to frontline health workers towards improving coverage of MNCH services. What did researchers do and find? Twenty-two Primary Health Centers (PHCs) were randomly allocated to usual care from public health providers from the government with (11 PHCs, 280 ASHAs, population: 234,134) or without (11 PHCs, 281 ASHAs, population: 242,809) an mHealth intervention. The mHealth intervention included a package of various mobile-phone-technology-based job aids to facilitate longitudinal tracking, scheduling of health services, screening for complications, counseling for behavior change communication, and real-time monitoring and supportive supervision by supervisory staff at PHCs. Twelve months after the implementation, mothers were surveyed. We found that coverage and quality of most of the MNCH services were significantly higher among PHCs that were served by ASHAs who used mHealth as a job aid compared to those who did not. The coverage of at least two home visits within first week of birth was 32.4% in the mHealth intervention group, compared to 22.9% in the control group. A composite index, which was calculated based on coverage of multiple key MNCH services, was 43.0% in the mHealth intervention group compared to 38.5% in the nonintervention group. The ASHAs regularly used and adhered to the mHealth intervention; however, its use was low among the PHC staff. What do these findings mean? To our knowledge, this is the one of the first studies of its kind that assessed effectiveness of multiple mHealth job aids implemented in a low- and middle-income country (LMIC) through frontline health workers in an existing public health system throughout the continuum of care to improve wide range of MNCH outcomes among hard-to-reach populations using a robust research methodology. Adequate supportive supervision, change management, and ongoing technology assistance is crucial to ensure satisfactory adherence to the intervention. Our findings support the scale-up of mobile-phone-technology-based interventions as a job aid to frontline health workers to improve health outcomes.

TI Text messaging for maternal and infant retention in prevention of
   mother-to-child HIV transmission services: A pragmatic stepped-wedge
   cluster-randomized trial in Kenya
SO PLOS MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; IMPACT; CARE; IMPLEMENTATION
AB Background Timely diagnosis of infant HIV infection is essential for antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation. In a randomized controlled trial, we found the Texting Improves Testing (TextIT) intervention (a theory-based text messaging system) to be efficacious for improving infant HIV testing rates and maternal retention in prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) programs. Using an implementation science approach, we aimed to evaluate real-world effectiveness of the intervention. Methods and findings In a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, stepped-wedge trial with 2 time periods of observation, we randomly allocated 10 clinics to begin implementing the intervention immediately and 10 clinics to begin implementing 6 months later. To approximate real-world conditions, inclusion criteria were broad. Women at clinics implementing the intervention received up to 14 text messages during pregnancy and after delivery and had the option to respond to text messages, call, or send inquiry text messages to a designated clinic phone. The primary outcomes were infant HIV testing and maternal retention in care during the first 8 weeks after delivery. We used modified Poisson regression with robust variance estimation to estimate the relative risk and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Generalized estimating equations were applied on individual-level data to account for clustering by site. Between February 2015 and December 2016, 4,681 women were assessed for study participation, and 2,515 were included. Participant characteristics at enrollment did not differ by study arm. Overall median age was 27 years (interquartile range [IQR] 23-30), median gestational age was 30 weeks (IQR 28-34), 99% were receiving ART, and 87% who enrolled during intervention phases owned a phone. Of 2,326 infants analyzed, 1,466 of 1,613 (90.9%) in the intervention group and 609 of 713 (85.4%) in the control group met the primary outcome of HIV virologic testing performed before 8 weeks after birth (adjusted relative risk [aRR] 1.03; 95% CI 0.97-1.10; P = 0.3). Of 2,472 women analyzed, 1,548 of 1,725 (90%) in the intervention group and 571 of 747 (76%) in the control group met the primary outcome of retention in care during the first 8 weeks after delivery (aRR 1.12; 95% CI 0.97-1.30; P = 0.1). This study had two main limitations. Staff at all facilities were aware of ongoing observation, which may have contributed to increased rates of infant HIV testing and maternal retention in care at both intervention and control facilities, and programmatic initiatives to improve maternal and infant retention in care were ongoing at all facilities at the time of this study, which likely limited the ability to demonstrate effectiveness of the trial intervention. Conclusions In this study, a larger proportion of infants in the intervention group received HIV testing compared with the control group, but the difference was small and not statistically significant. There was also a nonsignificant increase in maternal postpartum retention in the intervention periods. Despite the lack of a significant effect of the intervention, key lessons emerged, both for strengthening PMTCT and for implementation research in general. Perhaps most important, improving the implementation of usual care may have been sufficient to substantially improve infant HIV testing rates.
   Author summaryWhy was this study done? Low retention of mother-infant pairs in postpartum HIV care poses a major threat to successful elimination of mother-to-child HIV transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. The increase in the number of mobile phone connections in sub-Saharan Africa has been spectacular, presenting a unique opportunity to add mobile technology for health (mHealth) to the armamentarium for turning the tide of HIV. We developed the Texting Improves Testing (TextIT) intervention to improve uptake of infant HIV testing and maternal retention in postpartum HIV care in a high-HIV-burden setting. Text messages were designed using behavioral theory. Women received up to 14 text messages during pregnancy and after delivery. Messages were tailored based on recipient's gestational age, name, preferred time, desired language (English, Kiswahili, or Dholuo), date of delivery, and infant's name. Participants had the option to respond to text messages, call, or send inquiry text messages. In a randomized controlled efficacy trial, we found that the TextIT intervention significantly improved rates of infant HIV testing and maternal retention in postpartum HIV care. To achieve policy change leading to broader implementation of this evidence-based intervention, we sought to provide evidence of effectiveness under real-world routine care conditions. What did the researchers do and find? Using an implementation science approach, we designed a cluster randomized, stepped-wedge trial with 2 time periods of observation. We randomly allocated 10 health facilities to begin implementing the intervention immediately, while the remaining 10 began implementing approximately 6 months later. Consistent with real-world implementation conditions, inclusion criteria were minimal. Women were offered the opportunity to receive text messages if they were >= 18 years old or emancipated minors and between 28 weeks' gestation and delivery. We found that 1,466 of 1,613 (90.9%) infants in the intervention group underwent HIV testing within 8 weeks after birth compared to 609 of 713 (85.4%) in the control group. We also found that 1,548 of 1,725 (90%) women in the intervention group were retained in care during the first 8 weeks after delivery compared to 571 of 747 (76%) in the control group. What do these findings mean? We observed nonsignificant increases in infant HIV testing and maternal retention in postpartum care associated with short message service (SMS) text messaging. Nevertheless, HIV testing of >90% aligns with the global target of diagnosing >90% of all children living with HIV. Recognizing that strict adherence to statistical thresholds in implementation research may not provide optimal guidance for public health practice, interpretation of estimates of improvement in such studies should be contextualized in terms of the costs and benefits of implementing at scale.

TI High-resolution mapping of tuberculosis transmission: Whole genome
   sequencing and phylogenetic modelling of a cohort from Valencia Region,
   Spain
SO PLOS MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; SPECTRUM; TOOL
AB Author summaryWhy was this study done? To facilitate public health intervention and to design new tuberculosis (TB) control strategies, there is a need to identify when TB is transmitted and by whom. Whole genome sequencing combined with phylogenetic modelling has the potential to fill knowledge gaps on TB epidemiology. What did the researchers do and find? We analyzed a population-based cohort of TB patients in Valencia Region, Spain, between 2014 and 2016. We systematically sequenced the whole genomes of culture positive isolates and identified transmission clusters. We combined genomic and epidemiological data to understand how TB is transmitted. We showed that in many cases the index case is likely either not sampled or not the first diagnosed. For a fraction of TB individuals, we could accurately predict when transmission happened. For several transmitters we showed that transmission happened well before diagnosis and symptom onset. What do these findings mean? Our findings provide novel insights into TB transmission going beyond cluster delineation. Our results highlight the limitation of contact tracing to identify index cases and can be used to design new TB control strategies. The finding that TB can be transmitted by individuals before they have symptoms, very likely during sub-clinical or incipient disease, has important implications for TB control strategies. More studies are needed to understand the dynamics of TB transmission in different clinical settings. This study highlights the importance of combining genomic data with epidemiological data, in order to gain new insight into how and when TB is transmitted.
   Background Whole genome sequencing provides better delineation of transmission clusters in Mycobacterium tuberculosis than traditional methods. However, its ability to reveal individual transmission links within clusters is limited. Here, we used a 2-step approach based on Bayesian transmission reconstruction to (1) identify likely index and missing cases, (2) determine risk factors associated with transmitters, and (3) estimate when transmission happened. Methods and findings We developed our transmission reconstruction method using genomic and epidemiological data from a population-based study from Valencia Region, Spain. Tuberculosis (TB) incidence during the study period was 8.4 cases per 100,000 people. While the study is ongoing, the sampling frame for this work includes notified TB cases between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2016. We identified a total of 21 transmission clusters that fulfilled the criteria for analysis. These contained a total of 117 individuals diagnosed with active TB (109 with epidemiological data). Demographic characteristics of the study population were as follows: 80/109 (73%) individuals were Spanish-born, 76/109 (70%) individuals were men, and the mean age was 42.51 years (SD 18.46). We found that 66/109 (61%) TB patients were sputum positive at diagnosis, and 10/109 (9%) were HIV positive. We used the data to reveal individual transmission links, and to identify index cases, missing cases, likely transmitters, and associated transmission risk factors. Our Bayesian inference approach suggests that at least 60% of index cases are likely misidentified by local public health. Our data also suggest that factors associated with likely transmitters are different to those of simply being in a transmission cluster, highlighting the importance of differentiating between these 2 phenomena. Our data suggest that type 2 diabetes mellitus is a risk factor associated with being a transmitter (odds ratio 0.19 [95% CI 0.02-1.10], p < 0.003). Finally, we used the most likely timing for transmission events to study when TB transmission occurred; we identified that 5/14 (35.7%) cases likely transmitted TB well before symptom onset, and these were largely sputum negative at diagnosis. Limited within-cluster diversity does not allow us to extrapolate our findings to the whole TB population in Valencia Region. Conclusions In this study, we found that index cases are often misidentified, with downstream consequences for epidemiological investigations because likely transmitters can be missed. Our findings regarding inferred transmission timing suggest that TB transmission can occur before patient symptom onset, suggesting also that TB transmits during sub-clinical disease. This result has direct implications for diagnosing TB and reducing transmission. Overall, we show that a transition to individual-based genomic epidemiology will likely close some of the knowledge gaps in TB transmission and may redirect efforts towards cost-effective contact investigations for improved TB control.

AB The influenza A virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex consists in three subunits, PB2, PB1 and PA, that perform transcription and replication of the viral genome through very distinct mechanisms. Biochemical and structural studies have revealed that the polymerase can adopt multiple conformations and form oligomers. However so far it remained unclear whether the available oligomeric crystal structures represent a functional state of the polymerase. Here we gained new insights into this question, by investigating the incompatibility between non-cognate subunits of influenza polymerase brought together through genetic reassortment. We observed that a 7:1 reassortant virus whose PB2 segment derives from the A/WSN/33 (WSN) virus in an otherwise A/PR/8/34 (PR8) backbone is attenuated, despite a 97% identity between the PR8-PB2 and WSN-PB2 proteins. Independent serial passages led to the selection of phenotypic revertants bearing distinct second-site mutations on PA, PB1 and/or PB2. The constellation of mutations present on one revertant virus was studied extensively using reverse genetics and cell-based reconstitution of the viral polymerase. The PA-E349K mutation appeared to play a major role in correcting the initial defect in replication (cRNA -> vRNA) of the PR8xWSN-PB2 reassortant. Strikingly the PA-E349K mutation, and also the PB2-G74R and PB1-K577G mutations present on other revertants, are located at a dimerization interface of the polymerase. All three restore wild-type-like polymerase activity in a minigenome assay while decreasing the level of polymerase dimerization. Overall, our data show that the polymerase subunits co-evolve to ensure not only optimal inter-subunit interactions within the heterotrimer, but also proper levels of dimerization of the heterotrimer which appears to be essential for efficient viral RNA replication. Our findings point to influenza polymerase dimerization as a feature that is controlled by a complex interplay of genetic determinants, can restrict genetic reassortment, and could become a target for antiviral drug development.
   Author summary Influenza viruses, because of their yearly recurrence and the occasional emergence of pandemics, represent a worldwide major public health threat. Enhancing the fundamental knowledge on the influenza RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, a PB1-PB2-PA heterotrimer which ensures transcription and replication of the viral genome, is essential to reach the goal of better prevention and treatment of the disease. Here we gained new insights into the viral polymerase function by investigating the incompatibility between polymerase subunits derived from distinct parental influenza viruses and brought together through genetic reassortment. Our data show that the polymerase subunits co-evolve to ensure not only optimal inter-subunit cooperation within the heterotrimer, but also proper levels of dimerization of the heterotrimer which appears to be essential for efficient viral RNA replication. Our findings point to influenza polymerase dimerization as a feature that can restrict genetic reassortment, a major evolutionary mechanism for influenza viruses, and could become an attractive target for antiviral drug development.

AB It has been 20 years since West Nile virus first emerged in the Americas, and since then, little progress has been made to control outbreaks caused by this virus. After its first detection in New York in 1999, West Nile virus quickly spread across the continent, causing an epidemic of human disease and massive bird die-offs. Now the virus has become endemic to the United States, where an estimated 7 million human infections have occurred, making it the leading mosquito-borne virus infection and the most common cause of viral encephalitis in the country. To bring new attention to one of the most important mosquito-borne viruses in the Americas, we provide an interactive review using Nextstrain: a visualization tool for real-time tracking of pathogen evolution (nextstrain.org/WNV/NA). Nextstrain utilizes a growing database of more than 2,000 West Nile virus genomes and harnesses the power of phylogenetics for students, educators, public health workers, and researchers to visualize key aspects of virus spread and evolution. Using Nextstrain, we use virus genomics to investigate the emergence of West Nile virus in the U S, followed by its rapid spread, evolution in a new environment, establishment of endemic transmission, and subsequent international spread. For each figure, we include a link to Nextstrain to allow the readers to directly interact with and explore the underlying data in new ways. We also provide a brief online narrative that parallels this review to further explain the data and highlight key epidemiological and evolutionary features (nextstrain.org/narratives/twenty-years-of-WNV). Mirroring the dynamic nature of outbreaks, the Nextstrain links provided within this paper are constantly updated as new West Nile virus genomes are shared publicly, helping to stay current with the research. Overall, our review showcases how genomics can track West Nile virus spread and evolution, as well as potentially uncover novel targeted control measures to help alleviate its public health burden.

AB Plasmodium parasites are the causative agents of malaria, a disease with wide public health repercussions. Increasing drug resistance and the absence of a vaccine make finding new chemotherapeutic strategies imperative. Components of the ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like pathways have garnered increased attention as novel targets given their necessity to parasite survival. Understanding how these pathways are regulated in Plasmodium and identifying differences to the host is paramount to selectively interfering with parasites. Here, we focus on Nedd8 modification in Plasmodium falciparum, given its central role to cell division and DNA repair, processes critical to Plasmodium parasites given their unusual cell cycle and requirement for refined repair mechanisms. By applying a functional chemical approach, we show that deNeddylation is controlled by a different set of enzymes in the parasite versus the human host. We elucidate the molecular determinants of the unusual dual ubiquitin/Nedd8 recognition by the essential PfUCH37 enzyme and, through parasite transgenics and drug assays, determine that only its ubiquitin activity is critical to parasite survival. Our experiments reveal interesting evolutionary differences in how neddylation is controlled in higher versus lower eukaryotes, and highlight the Nedd8 pathway as worthy of further exploration for therapeutic targeting in antimalarial drug design.
   Author summary Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like post-translational modifications are evolutionarily conserved and involved in fundamental cellular processes essential to all eukaryotes. As such, enzymatic components of these pathways present attractive targets for therapeutic intervention for both chronic and communicable diseases. Nedd8 modification of cullin ubiquitin E3 ligases is critical to the viability of eukaryotic organisms and mediates cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair. Given the complex lifecycle and unusual replication mechanisms of the malaria parasite, one would expect neddylation to be of central importance to its survival, yet little is known about this pathway in Plasmodium. Here we present our findings on how Nedd8 removal is controlled in Plasmodium falciparum and how this pathway differs to that of its human host.

AB Respiratory viral infections contribute substantially to global infant losses and disproportionately affect preterm neonates. Using our previously established neonatal murine model of influenza infection, we demonstrate that three-day old mice are exceptionally sensitive to influenza virus infection and exhibit high mortality and viral load. Intranasal pre- and post-treatment of neonatal mice with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), an immune modulator in respiratory viral infection of adult mice and human preterm neonates, considerably improves neonatal mice survival after influenza virus infection. We determine that both live and heat-killed intranasal LGG are equally efficacious in protection of neonates. Early in influenza infection, neonatal transcriptional responses in the lung are delayed compared to adults. These responses increase by 24 hours post-infection, demonstrating a delay in the kinetics of the neonatal anti-viral response. LGG pretreatment improves immune gene transcriptional responses during early infection and specifically upregulates type I IFN pathways. This is critical for protection, as neonatal mice intranasally pre-treated with IFN beta before influenza virus infection are also protected. Using transgenic mice, we demonstrate that the protective effect of LGG is mediated through a MyD88-dependent mechanism, specifically via TLR4. LGG can improve both early control of virus and transcriptional responsiveness and could serve as a simple and safe intervention to protect neonates.
   Author summary Viral lung infections are the number one reason for hospitalization of children under the age of 5 and are a major public health concern. Premature babies, or those born before 37 weeks gestation, are particularly susceptible to viral infections, but exact mechanisms for this susceptibility have not been determined. Here, using a pre-clinical infant mouse model of influenza virus infection, we have found increased neonatal susceptibility to respiratory viral infection compared to adults, and we demonstrate that a probiotic administered intranasally prior to infection provides dramatic protection to infant mice by inducing production of a key anti-viral cytokine, type I interferons.

AB Rubella viruses (RV) have been found in an association with granulomas in children with primary immune deficiencies (PID). Here, we report the recovery and characterization of infectious immunodeficiency-related vaccine-derived rubella viruses (iVDRV) from diagnostic skin biopsies of four patients. Sequence evolution within PID hosts was studied by comparison of the complete genomic sequences of the iVDRVs with the genome of the vaccine virus RA27/3. The degree of divergence of each iVDRV correlated with the duration of persistence indicating continuous intrahost evolution. The evolution rates for synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions were estimated to be 5.7 x 10(-3) subs/site/year and 8.9 x 10(-4) subs/site/year, respectively. Mutational spectra and signatures indicated a major role for APOBEC cytidine deaminases and a secondary role for ADAR adenosine deaminases in generating diversity of iVDRVs. The distributions of mutations across the genes and 3D hotspots for amino acid substitutions in the E1 glycoprotein identified regions that may be under positive selective pressure. Quasispecies diversity was higher in granulomas than in recovered infectious iVDRVs. Growth properties of iVDRVs were assessed in WI-38 fibroblast cultures. None of the iVDRV isolates showed complete reversion to wild type phenotype but the replicative and persistence characteristics of iVDRVs were different from those of the RA27/3 vaccine strain, making predictions of iVDRV transmissibility and teratogenicity difficult. However, detection of iVDRV RNA in nasopharyngeal specimen and poor neutralization of some iVDRV strains by sera from vaccinated persons suggests possible public health risks associated with iVDRV carriers. Detection of IgM antibody to RV in sera of two out of three patients may be a marker of virus persistence, potentially useful for identifying patients with iVDRV before development of lesions. Studies of the evolutionary dynamics of iVDRV during persistence will contribute to development of infection control strategies and antiviral therapies.
   Author summary Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) are caused by genetic defects and lead to serious problems including chronic granulomas (abnormal collections (nodules) of inflammatory cells), sometimes lasting for decades and sometimes leading to severe ulcers. Initial reports (2014-2016), including our report of a blinded study using ultrasensitive virus detection in biopsies, proved the association between granuloma of the skin in PID patients and rubella virus. The viruses in these reports and the current report were derived from a widely used vaccine strain of the rubella virus. Work reported here shows that these vaccine-derived viruses are biologically different from the vaccine virus and that their genomes have changed. Genomic changes could be analyzed largely because the exact sequence of starting vaccine virus genome was known. These genomic differences are likely generated via mechanisms similar to those occurring during normal circulation of wild type rubella. We present data that newly recognized mechanisms for generation of sequence diversity in viruses (because of cellular deaminases) likely occurs in the generation of these vaccine-derived rubella viruses. Thousands of PID patients in the United States are likely shedding these vaccine-derived rubella viruses. Our work presented here characterizing viruses in diagnostic specimens highlights at least two areas where insufficient work has been done: 1) research on the properties of rubella virus (limited understanding of the antibody binding sites on the virus); 2) controlled research studies to assess the public health impact of viruses in populations with high immunity.

TI A systematic review of the epidemiology of human monkeypox outbreaks and
   implications for outbreak strategy

   COMMUNITY; DISEASE; AFRICA; SURVEILLANCE
AB Monkeypox is a vesicular-pustular illness that carries a secondary attack rate in the order of 10% in contacts unvaccinated against smallpox. Case fatality rates range from 1 to 11%, but scarring and other sequelae are common in survivors. It continues to cause outbreaks in remote populations in Central and West Africa, in areas with poor access and weakened or disrupted surveillance capacity and information networks. Recent outbreaks in Nigeria (2017-18) and Cameroon (2018) have occurred where monkeypox has not been reported for over 20 years. This has prompted concerns over whether there have been changes in the biology and epidemiology of the disease that may in turn have implications for how outbreaks and cases should best be managed. A systematic review was carried out to examine reported data on human monkeypox outbreaks over time, and to identify if and how epidemiology has changed. Published and grey literature were critically analysed, and data extracted to inform recommendations on outbreak response, use of case definitions and public health advice. The level of detail, validity of data, geographical coverage and consistency of reporting varied considerably across the 71 monkeypox outbreak documents obtained. An increase in cases reported over time was supported by literature from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Data were insufficient to measure trends in secondary attack rates and case fatality rates. Phylogenetic analyses consistently identify two strains of the virus without evidence of emergence of a new strain. Understanding of monkeypox virulence with regard to clinical presentation by strain is minimal, with infrequent sample collection and laboratory analysis. A variety of clinical and surveillance case definitions are described in the literature: two definitions have been formally evaluated and showed high sensitivity but low specificity. These were specific to a Congo-Basin (CB) strain-affected area of the DRC where they were used. Evidence on use of antibiotics for prophylaxis against secondary cutaneous infection is anecdotal and limited. Current evidence suggests there has been an increase in total monkeypox cases reported by year in the DRC irrespective of advancements in the national Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) system. There has been a marked increase in number of individual monkeypox outbreak reports, from outside the DRC in between 2010 and 2018, particularly in the Central African Republic (CAR) although this does not necessarily indicate an increase in annual cases over time in these areas. The geographical pattern reported in the Nigeria outbreak suggests a possible new and widespread zoonotic reservoir requiring further investigation and research. With regards to outbreak response, increased attention is warranted for high-risk patient groups, and nosocomial transmission risks. The animal reservoir remains unknown and there is a dearth of literature informing case management and successful outbreak response strategies. Up-to-date complete, consistent and longer-term research is sorely needed to inform and guide evidence-based response and management of monkeypox outbreaks.

AB Background
   Aedes mosquitoes are vectors of arboviral diseases of great relevance for public health. The recent outbreaks of dengue, Zika, chikungunya and the rapid worldwide spreading of Aedes albopictus emphasize the need for improvement of vector surveillance and control. Host antibody response to mosquito salivary antigens is emerging as a relevant additional tool to directly assess vector-host contact, monitor efficacy of control interventions and evaluate risk of arboviral transmission.
   Methodology/principal findings
   Groups of four BALB/c mice were immunized by exposure to bites of either Aedes albopictus or Aedes aegypti. The 34k2 salivary proteins from Ae. albopictus (al34k2) and Ae. aegypti (ae34k2) were expressed in recombinant form and Ae. albopictus salivary peptides were designed through B-cell epitopes prediction software. IgG responses to salivary gland extracts, peptides, al34k2 and ae34k2 were measured in exposed mice. Both al34k2 and ae34k2, with some individual and antigen-specific variation, elicited a clearly detectable antibody response in immunized mice. Remarkably, the two orthologous proteins showed very low level of immune cross-reactivity, suggesting they may eventually be developed as species-specific markers of host exposure. The al34k2 immunogenicity and the limited immune cross-reactivity to ae34k2 were confirmed in a single human donor hyperimmune to Ae. albopictus saliva.
   Conclusions/significance
   Our study shows that exposure to bites of Ae. albopictus or Ae. aegypti evokes in mice species-specific IgG responses to al34k2 or ae34k2, respectively. Deeper understanding of duration of antibody response and validation in natural conditions of human exposure to Aedes mosquitoes are certainly needed. However, our findings point to the al34k2 salivary protein as a promising potential candidate for the development of immunoassays to evaluate human exposure to Ae. albopictus. This would be a step forward in the establishment of a serological toolbox for the simultaneous assessment of human exposure to Aedes vectors and the pathogens they transmit.

TI Pgp3 seroprevalence and associations with active trachoma and ocular
   Chlamydia trachomatis infection in Malawi: cross-sectional surveys in
   six evaluation units
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID PREVALENCE
AB Background
   Following one to five years of antibiotic mass drug administration (MDA) for the elimination of trachoma as a public health problem, programmes must conduct impact surveys to inform decisions on whether MDA is still needed. These decisions are currently based on the prevalence of trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF), which, after MDA, correlates poorly with prevalence of ocular Chlamydia trachomatis infection.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   Impact surveys in six evaluation units (EUs) of Malawi were used as a platform to explore associations between the prevalence of TF, ocular C. trachomatis infection and anti-Pgp3 antibodies one year after the third annual round of MDA. Participants were examined for trachoma using the World Health Organization simplified grading system. Ocular swabs and dried blood spots (DBS) were collected from children aged 1-9 years. Swabs were tested for C. trachomatis DNA using GeneXpert. DBS were assayed for anti-Pgp3 antibodies using ELISA. EU-level prevalence of TF in children aged 1-9 years ranged from 4.7% (95% CI 3.4-6.3) to 7.2% (95% CI 5.8-8.9). Prevalence of C. trachomatis infection in children ranged from 0.1% (95% CI 0.0-0.6) to 0.7% (95% CI 0.3-1.3) while Pgp3 seroprevalence ranged from 6.9% (95% CI 5.4-8.6) to 12.0% (95% CI 10.1-14.0) and increased with age.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Based on current global policy, the prevalence of TF indicates that a further year of antibiotic MDA is warranted in four of six EUs yet the very low levels of infection cast doubt on the universal applicability of TF-based cut-offs for antibiotic MDA. Pgp3 seroprevalence was similar to that reported following MDA in other settings that have reached the elimination target however the predictive value of any particular level of seropositivity with respect to risk of subsequent infection recrudescence is, as yet, unknown.

   Schistosomiasis is a widespread public health concern in the poorest regions of the world. The principal control strategy is regular praziquantel administration to school-aged children in endemic areas. With calls for the elimination of schistosomiasis as a public health problem, expanding praziquantel delivery to all community members has been advocated. This systematic review and meta-analysis compares the impact of community-wide and child-targeted praziquantel distribution on schistosomiasis prevalence and intensity in school-aged children.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   We searched MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science to identify papers that reported schistosome prevalence before and after praziquantel administration, either to children only or to all community members. Extracted data included Schistosoma species, drug administration strategy, number of treatment rounds, follow-up interval and prevalence and intensity before and after treatment. We used inverse variance weighted generalised linear models to examine the impact of mass versus targeted drug administration on prevalence reduction, and weighted boxplots to examine the impact on infection intensity reduction. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018095377.
   In total, 34 articles were eligible for systematic review and 28 for meta-analysis. Schistosoma mansoni was reported in 20 studies; Schistosoma haematobium in 19 studies, and Schistosoma japonicum in two studies. Results of generalised linear models showed no detectable difference between mass and targeted treatment strategies on prevalence reduction in school-aged children for S. mansoni (odds ratio 0.47, 95%CI 0.13-1.68, p = 0.227) and S. haematobium (0.41, 95%CI 0.06-3.03, p = 0.358). Box plots also showed no apparent differences in intensity reduction between the two treatment strategies.
   Conclusions/Significance
   The results of this meta-analysis do not support the hypothesis that community-wide treatment is more effective than targeted treatment at reducing schistosomiasis infections in children. This may be due to the relatively small number of included studies, insufficient treatment coverage, persistent infection hotspots and unmeasured confounders. Further field-based studies comparing mass and targeted treatment are required.

TI Village-scale persistence and elimination of gambiense human African
   trypanosomiasis
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID STOCHASTIC EPIDEMICS; DURATION; SIZE
AB Gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) is one of several neglected tropical diseases that is targeted for elimination by the World Health Organization. Recent years have seen a substantial decline in the number of globally reported cases, largely driven by an intensive process of screening and treatment. However, this infection is highly focal, continuing to persist at low prevalence even in small populations. Regional elimination, and ultimately global eradication, rests on understanding the dynamics and persistence of this infection at the local population scale. Here we develop a stochastic model of gHAT dynamics, which is underpinned by screening and reporting data from one of the highest gHAT incidence regions, Kwilu Province, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We use this model to explore the persistence of gHAT in villages of different population sizes and subject to different patterns of screening. Our models demonstrate that infection is expected to persist for long periods even in relatively small isolated populations. We further use the model to assess the risk of recrudescence following local elimination and consider how failing to detect cases during active screening events informs the probability of elimination. These quantitative results provide insights for public health policy in the region, particularly highlighting the difficulties in achieving and measuring the 2030 elimination goal.

TI Endemic Disease Control Agents' perception on the fight against Aedes
   aegypti and the prevention of arbovirus infections in Brazil
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH
AB Background
   Arboviruses pose a serious and constant threat to public health, and have demanded surveillance efforts worldwide. The prevention of arbovirus transmission depends on effective measures to control vectors and promote health. The objective of this study was to examine the factors that enhance and impair the endemic disease control agents' field work, based on their own perspective.
   Methodology and main findings
   In 2017, 65 ACE of seven municipalities participated in a series of seven focus groups in the Zona de Mata mesoregion (Minas Gerais, Brazil). The focus groups were organized aiming to broaden and deepen the discussion and analysis of ACE perception of their performance in relation to attributions, work processes, training, continuous education, and evaluation. All the workers, irrespective of municipality, recognize their role in disease prevention and health promotion, however they suffer from a reductionist stigma associated with their profession. Also, internal and external factors such as infrastructure, resources, administrative management, and the work process affect the quality of service delivered and job satisfaction. Practice challenges include incompatible demands such as refusal by residents and high sense of insecurity related to violence. The respondents reported that success of their activities depend on the population.
   Conclusions/Significance
   The recurrence of epidemics demands effective vector control policies. Therefore, the performance of these professionals as regards surveillance needs to be reassessed. Public awareness and acknowledgement of the role of ACE in the identification of risk and health protection factors are indispensable for the improvement of this workforce.

TI Management of insecticide resistance in the major Aedes vectors of
   arboviruses: Advances and challenges
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES

DT Review
ID MOSQUITO CULEX-PIPIENS; ANOPHELES-GAMBIAE; DIPTERA-CULICIDAE; GLOBAL
   PLAN; AEGYPTI; IMPACT; EVOLUTION; SUSCEPTIBILITY; SELECTION; EFFICACY
AB Background
   The landscape of mosquito-borne disease risk has changed dramatically in recent decades, due to the emergence and reemergence of urban transmission cycles driven by invasive Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus. Insecticide resistance is already widespread in the yellow fever mosquito, Ae. Aegypti; is emerging in the Asian tiger mosquito Ae. Albopictus; and is now threatening the global fight against human arboviral diseases such as dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika. Because the panel of insecticides available for public health is limited, it is of primary importance to preserve the efficacy of existing and upcoming active ingredients. Timely implementation of insecticide resistance management (IRM) is crucial to maintain the arsenal of effective public health insecticides and sustain arbovirus vector control.
   Methodology and principal findings
   This Review is one of a series being generated by the Worldwide Insecticide resistance Network (WIN) and aims at defining the principles and concepts underlying IRM, identifying the main factors affecting the evolution of resistance, and evaluating the value of existing tools for resistance monitoring. Based on the lessons taken from resistance strategies used for other vector species and agricultural pests, we propose a framework for the implementation of IRM strategies for Aedes mosquito vectors.
   Conclusions and significance
   Although IRM should be a fixture of all vector control programs, it is currently often absent from the strategic plans to control mosquito-borne diseases, especially arboviruses. Experiences from other public health disease vectors and agricultural pests underscore the need for urgent action in implementing IRM for invasive Aedes mosquitoes. Based on a plan developed for malaria vectors, here we propose some key activities to establish a global plan for IRM in Aedes spp.

TI Pre-operative trichiatic eyelash pattern predicts post-operative
   trachomatous trichiasis
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID SURGERY; RECURRENCE; TRIAL; CLAMP; RISK
AB Importance
   Trichiasis surgery programs globally have faced high rates of poor surgical outcomes. Identifying correctable risk factors for improving long-term outcomes is essential for countries targeting elimination of trachoma as a public health problem.
   Objective
   To determine whether the location of trichiatic eyelashes prior to surgery influences development of post-operative trichiasis (PTT) within two years after surgery.
   Design
   Secondary data analysis of four randomized clinical trials evaluating methods to improve trichiasis surgery outcomes. These include the Surgery for Trichiasis, Antibiotics for Recurrence (STAR) trial, Partnership for Rapid Elimination of Trachoma (PRET-Surgery), absorbable versus silk sutures trial, and epilation versus surgery for minor trichiasis trial.
   Setting
   Primary trials were conducted in rural areas of Ethiopia and Tanzania
   Interventions or exposures
   Trichiasis surgery performed with either the bilamellar tarsal rotation procedure or posterior lamellar rotation procedure
   Main outcomes
   Prevalence of PTT within two years after surgery, location of trichiatic eyelashes pre-operatively and post-operatively
   Results
   6,747 eyelids that underwent first-time trichiasis surgery were included. PTT rates varied by study, ranging from 10-40%. PTT was less severe (based on number of trichiatic eyelashes) than initial trichiasis for 72% of those developing PTT, and only 2% of eyelids were worse at follow up than pre-operatively. Eyelids with central only-trichiasis pre-operatively had lower rates of PTT than eyelids with peripheral only trichiasis in each of the three trials that included severe TT cases. 10% of eyelids with peripheral trichiasis pre-operatively that develop PTT have central TT post-operatively.
   Conclusions and relevance
   Pre-operative central trichiasis is less likely than peripheral trichiasis to be associated with subsequent PTT. Regardless of type of surgery, surgeon skill levels, or pre-operative trichiasis severity, the presence of peripheral trichiasis pre-operatively is associated with higher rates of PTT. Making an incision that extends the length of the eyelid and adequately rotating the nasal and temporal aspects of the eyelid when suturing may help to minimize the chance of developing peripheral PTT.

TI Positive association between Brucella spp. seroprevalences in livestock
   and humans from a cross-sectional study in Garissa and Tana River
   Counties, Kenya
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID RISK-FACTORS; CATTLE
AB c Background
   Brucella spp. is a zoonotic bacterial agent of high public health and socio-economic importance. It infects many species of animals including wildlife, and people may get exposed through direct contact with an infected animal or consumption of raw or undercooked animal products. A linked livestock-human cross-sectional study to determine seroprevalences and risk factors of brucellosis in livestock and humans was designed. Estimates were made for intra-cluster correlation coefficients (ICCs) for these observations at the household and village levels.
   Methodology
   The study was implemented in Garissa (specifically Ijara and Sangailu areas) and Tana River (Bura and Hola) counties. A household was the unit of analysis and the sample size was derived using the standard procedures. Serum samples were obtained from selected livestock and people from randomly selected households. Humans were sampled in both counties, while livestock could be sampled only in Tana River County. Samples obtained were screened for anti-Brucella IgG antibodies using ELISA kits. Data were analyzed using generalized linear mixed effects logistic regression models with the household (herd) and village being used as random effects.
   Results
   The overall Brucella spp. seroprevalences were 3.47% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.72-4.36%) and 35.81% (95% CI: 32.87-38.84) in livestock and humans, respectively. In livestock, older animals and those sampled in Hola had significantly higher seroprevalences than younger ones or those sampled in Bura. Herd and village random effects were significant and ICC estimates associated with these variables were 0.40 (95% CI: 0.22-0.60) and 0.24 (95% CI: 0.08-0.52), respectively. In humans, Brucella spp. seroprevalence was significantly higher in older people, males, and people who lived in pastoral areas than younger ones, females or those who lived in irrigated or riverine areas. People from households that had at least one seropositive animal were 3.35 (95% CI: 1.51-7.41) times more likely to be seropositive compared to those that did not. Human exposures significantly clustered at the household level; the ICC estimate obtained was 0.21 (95% CI: 0.06-0.52).
   Conclusion
   The presence of a Brucella spp.-seropositive animal in a household significantly increased the odds of Brucella spp. seropositivity in humans in that household. Exposure to Brucella spp. of both livestock and humans clustered significantly at the household level. This suggests that risk-based surveillance measures, guided by locations of primary cases reported, either in humans or livestock, can be used to detect Brucella spp. infections in livestock or humans, respectively.

AB Introduction
   Epidemic forecasting and prediction tools have the potential to provide actionable information in the midst of emerging epidemics. While numerous predictive studies were published during the 2016-2017 Zika Virus (ZIKV) pandemic, it remains unknown how timely, reproducible, and actionable the information produced by these studies was.
   Methods
   To improve the functional use of mathematical modeling in support of future infectious disease outbreaks, we conducted a systematic review of all ZIKV prediction studies published during the recent ZIKV pandemic using the PRISMA guidelines. Using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and grey literature review, we identified studies that forecasted, predicted, or simulated ecological or epidemiological phenomena related to the Zika pandemic that were published as of March 01, 2017. Eligible studies underwent evaluation of objectives, data sources, methods, timeliness, reproducibility, accessibility, and clarity by independent reviewers.
   Results
   2034 studies were identified, of which n = 73 met the eligibility criteria. Spatial spread, R-0 (basic reproductive number), and epidemic dynamics were most commonly predicted, with few studies predicting Guillain-Barre Syndrome burden (4%), sexual transmission risk (4%), and intervention impact (4%). Most studies specifically examined populations in the Americas (52%), with few African-specific studies (4%). Case count (67%), vector (41%), and demographic data (37%) were the most common data sources. Real-time internet data and pathogen genomic information were used in 7% and 0% of studies, respectively, and social science and behavioral data were typically absent in modeling efforts. Deterministic models were favored over stochastic approaches. Forty percent of studies made model data entirely available, 29% provided all relevant model code, 43% presented uncertainty in all predictions, and 54% provided sufficient methodological detail to allow complete reproducibility. Fifty-one percent of predictions were published after the epidemic peak in the Americas. While the use of preprints improved the accessibility of ZIKV predictions by a median of 119 days sooner than journal publication dates, they were used in only 30% of studies.
   Conclusions
   Many ZIKV predictions were published during the 2016-2017 pandemic. The accessibility, reproducibility, timeliness, and incorporation of uncertainty in these published predictions varied and indicates there is substantial room for improvement. To enhance the utility of analytical tools for outbreak response it is essential to improve the sharing of model data, code, and preprints for future outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics.

TI Association of Phlebotomus guggisbergi with Leishmania major and
   Leishmania tropica in a complex transmission setting for cutaneous
   leishmaniasis in Gilgil, Nakuru county, Kenya
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English

AB Background
   Phlebotomus (Larroussius) guggisbergi is among the confirmed vectors for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) transmission in Kenya. This scarring and stigmatizing form of leishmaniasis accounts for over one million annual cases worldwide. Most recent CL epidemics in Kenya have been reported in Gilgil, Nakuru County, where the disease has become a public health issue. However, little is known about the factors that drive its transmission. Here, we sought to determine the occurrence, distribution and host blood feeding preference of the vectors, and to identify Leishmania species and infection rates in sandflies using molecular techniques. This information could lead to a better understanding of the disease transmission and improvement of control strategies in the area.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   An entomological survey of sandflies using CDC light traps was conducted for one week per month in April 2016, and in June and July 2017 from five villages of Gilgil, Nakuru county; Jaica, Sogonoi, Utut, Gitare and Njeru. Sandflies were identified to species level using morphological keys and further verified by PCR analysis of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. Midguts of female sandflies found to harbour Leishmania were ruptured and the isolated parasites cultured in Novy-MacNeal-Nicolle (NNN) media overlaid with Schneider's insect media to identify the species. Leishmania parasite screening and identification in 198 randomly selected Phlebotomus females and parasite cultures was done by PCR-RFLP analysis of ITS1 gene, nested kDNA-PCR and real-time PCR-HRM followed by sequencing. Bloodmeal source identification was done by real-time PCR-HRM of the vertebrate cytochrome-b gene. A total of 729 sandflies (males: n = 310; females: n = 419) were collected from Utut (36.6%), Jaica (24.3%), Sogonoi (34.4%), Njeru (4.5%), and Gitare (0.1%). These were found to consist of nine species: three Phlebotomus spp. and six Sergentomyia spp. Ph. guggisbergi was the most abundant species (75.4%, n = 550) followed by Ph. saevus sensu lato (11.3%, n = 82). Sandfly species distribution across the villages was found to be significantly different (p<0.001) with Jaica recording the highest diversity. The overall Leishmania infection rate in sandflies was estimated at 7.07% (14/198). Infection rates in Ph. guggisbergi and Ph. saevus s.l. were 9.09% (12/132) and 3.57% (2/56) respectively. L. tropica was found to be the predominant parasite in Gilgil with an overall infection rate of 6.91% (13/188) in Ph. guggisbergi (n = 11) and Ph. saevus s.l. (n = 2) sandflies. However, PCR analysis also revealed L. major infection in one Ph. guggisbergi specimen. Bloodmeal analysis in the 74 blood-fed sandflies disclosed a diverse range of vertebrate hosts in Ph. guggisbergi bloodmeals, while Ph. saevus s.l. fed mainly on humans.
   Conclusions/Significance
   The high infection rates of L. tropica and abundance of Ph. guggisbergi in this study confirms this sandfly as a vector of L. tropica in Kenya. Furthermore, isolation of live L. tropica parasites from Ph. saevus s.l. suggest that there are at least three potential vectors of this parasite species in Gilgil; Ph. guggisbergi, Ph. aculeatus and Ph. saevus s.l. Molecular identification of L. major infections in Ph. guggisbergi suggested this sandfly species as a potential permissive vector of L. major, which needs to be investigated further. Sandfly host preference analysis revealed the possibility of zoonotic transmissions of L. tropica in Gilgil since the main vector (Ph. guggisbergi) does not feed exclusively on humans but also other vertebrate species. Further investigations are needed to determine the potential role of these vertebrate species in L. tropica and L. major transmission in the area.

AB Background
   Small island developing states (SIDS) in the Caribbean region are challenged with managing the health outcomes of a changing climate. Health and climate sectors have partnered to co-develop climate services to improve the management of emerging arboviral diseases (e.g., dengue fever), for example, through the development of climate-driven early warning systems. The objective of this study was to identify health and climate stakeholder perceptions and needs in the Caribbean, with respect to the development of climate services for arboviruses.
   Methods
   Stakeholders included public decision makers and practitioners from the climate and health sectors at the regional (Caribbean) level and from the countries of Dominica and Barbados. From April to June 2017, we conducted interviews (n = 41), surveys (n = 32), and national workshops with stakeholders. Survey responses were tabulated, and audio recordings were transcribed and analyzed using qualitative coding to identify responses by research topic, country/region, and sector.
   Results
   Health practitioners indicated that their jurisdiction is currently experiencing an increased risk of arboviral diseases associated with climate variability, and most anticipated that this risk will increase in the future. National health sectors reported financial limitations and a lack of technical expertise in geographic information systems (GIS), statistics, and modeling, which constrained their ability to implement climate services for arboviruses. National climate sectors were constrained by a lack of personnel. Stakeholders highlighted the need to strengthen partnerships with the private sector, academia, and civil society. They identified a gap in local research on climate-arbovirus linkages, which constrained the ability of the health sector to make informed decisions. Strategies to strengthen the climate-health partnership included a top-down approach by engaging senior leadership, multi-lateral collaboration agreements, national committees on climate and health, and shared spaces of dialogue. Mechanisms for mainstreaming climate services for health operations to control arboviruses included climatic-health bulletins and an online GIS platform that would allow for regional data sharing and the generation of spatiotemporal epidemic forecasts. Stakeholders identified a 3-month forecast of arboviral illness as the optimal time frame for an epidemic forecast.
   Conclusions
   These findings support the creation of interdisciplinary and intersectoral 'communities of practice' and the co-design of climate services for the Caribbean public health sector. By fostering the effective use of climate information within health policy, research and practice, nations will have greater capacity to adapt to a changing climate.

   DIVERSITY; EMERGENCE; EVOLUTION; SURABAYA; DISEASE
AB Background
   Dengue virus (DENV) infection is a major cause of acute febrile illness in Indonesia. Diagnostic inaccuracy may occur due to its varied and non-specific presentation. Characterization of DENV epidemiology, clinical presentation, and virology will facilitate appropriate clinical management and public health policy.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   A multicenter observational cohort study was conducted in Indonesia to assess causes of acute fever requiring hospitalization. Clinical information and specimens were collected at enrollment, 14-28 days, and 3 months from 1,486 children and adults. Total of 468 (31.9%) cases of DENV infection were confirmed by reference laboratory assays. Of these, 414 (88.5%) were accurately diagnosed and 54 had been misdiagnosed as another infection by sites. One hundred initially suspected dengue cases were finally classified as 'non-dengue'; other pathogens were identified in 58 of those cases. Mortality of DENV infection was low (0.6%). Prior DENV exposure was found in 92.3% of subjects >12 years. DENV circulated year-round in all cities, with higher incidence from January to March. DENV-3 and DENV-1 were the predominant serotypes. This study identified DENV-1 with TS1(19)(C -> T) substitution in the serotyping primer annealing site, leading to failure of serotype determination.
   Conclusions/Significance
   DENV is a common etiology of acute febrile illness requiring hospitalization in Indonesia. Diagnostic accuracy at clinical sites merits optimization since misdiagnosis of DENV infection and over-estimation of dengue can negatively impact management and outcomes. Mutation at the annealing site of the serotyping primer may confound diagnosis. Clinicians should consider following diagnostic algorithms that include DENV confirmatory testing. Policy-makers should prioritize development of laboratory capacity for diagnosis of DENV.

AB Background
   Myiasis due to Old World screw-worm fly, Chrysomya bezziana, is an important obligate zoonotic disease in the OIE-list of diseases and is found throughout much of Africa, the Indian subcontinent, southeast and east Asia. C. bezziana myiasis causes not only morbidity and death to animals and humans, but also economic losses in the livestock industries. Because of the aggressive and destructive nature of this disease in hosts, we initiated this study to provide a comprehensive understanding of human myiasis caused by C. bezziana.
   Methods
   We searched the databases in English (PubMed, Embase and African Index Medicus) and Chinese (CNKI, Wanfang, and Duxiu), and international government online reports to 6th February, 2019, to identify studies concerning C. bezziana. Another ten human cases in China and Papua New Guinea that our team had recorded were also included.
   Results
   We retrieved 1,048 reports from which 202 studies were ultimately eligible for inclusion in the present descriptive analyses. Since the first human case due to C. bezziana was reported in 1909, we have summarized 291 cases and found that these cases often occurred in patients with poor hygiene, low socio-economic conditions, old age, and underlying diseases including infections, age-related diseases, and noninfectious chronic diseases. But C. bezziana myiasis appears largely neglected as a serious medical or veterinary condition, with human and animal cases only reported in 16 and 24 countries respectively, despite this fly species being recorded in 44 countries worldwide.
   Conclusion
   Our findings indicate that cryptic myiasis cases due to the obligate parasite, C. bezziana, are under-recognized. Through this study on C. bezziana etiology, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, epidemiology, prevention and control, we call for more vigilance and awareness of the disease from governments, health authorities, clinicians, veterinary workers, nursing homes, and also the general public.

AB Background The healthcare system can be understood as the dynamic result of the interaction of hospitals, patients, providers, and government configuring a complex network of reciprocal influences. In order to better understand such a complex system, the analysis must include characteristics that are feasible to be studied in order to redesign its functioning. The analysis of the emergent patterns of pregnant women flows crossing municipal borders for birth-related hospitalizations in a region of Sao Paulo, Brazil, allowed to examine the functionality of the regional division in the state using a complex systems approach and to propose answers to the dilemma of concentration vs. distribution of maternal care regional services in the context of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). Methods Cross-sectional research of the areas of influence of hospitals using spatial interaction methods, recording the points of origin and destination of the patients and exploring the emergent patterns of displacement. Results The resulting functional region is broader than the limits established in the legal provisions, verifying that 85% of patients move to hospitals with high technology to perform normal deliveries and cesarean sections. The region has high independence rates and behaves as a "service exporter." Patients going to centrally located hospitals travel twice as long as patients who receive care in other municipalities even when the patients' conditions do not demand technologically sophisticated services. The effects of regulation and the agents' preferences reinforce the tendency to refer patients to centrally located hospitals. Conclusions Displacement of patients during delivery may affect indicators of maternal and perinatal health. The emergent pattern of movements allowed examining the contradiction between wider deployments of services versus concentration of highly specialized resources in a few places. The study shows the potential of this type of analysis applied to other type of patients' flows, such as cancer or specialized surgery, as tools to guide the regionalization of the Brazilian Health System.

   DISEASES; BURDEN; TRENDS; DEATH
AB Objective
   To examine the epidemiology and outcomes of in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) among patients with cirrhosis.
   Methods
   We used the Texas Inpatient Public Use Data File to identify hospitalizations aged. 18 years with and without cirrhosis during 2009-2014 and those in each group who have undergone in-hospital CPR. Short-term survival (defined as absence of hospital mortality or discharge to hospice) following in-hospital CPR was examined. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to assess the prognostic impact of cirrhosis following in-hospital CPR and predictors of short-term survival among cirrhosis hospitalizations.
   Results
   In-hospital CPR was reported in 2,511 and 51,969 hospitalizations with and without cirrhosis, respectively. The rate of in-hospital CPR (per 1,000 hospitalizations) was 7.6 and 4.0 among hospitalizations with and without cirrhosis, respectively. The corresponding rate of in-hospital CPR among decedents was 10.7% and 13.4%, respectively. Short-term survival following in-hospital CPR among hospitalizations with and without cirrhosis was 14.9% and 27.3%, respectively, and remained unchanged over time on adjusted analyses among the former (p = 0.1753), while increasing among the latter (p = 0.0404). Cirrhosis was associated with lower odds of short-term survival following in-hospital CPR (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.55 [95% CI: 0.49-0.62]). Lack of health insurance (vs. Medicare) (aOR] 0.47 [95% CI: 0.34-0.67]) and sepsis ([aOR] 0.67 [95% CI: 0.53-85]) were associated with lower odds of short-term survival following in-hospital CPR among cirrhosis hospitalizations.
   Conclusions
   The rate of in-hospital CPR was nearly 2-fold higher among hospitalizations with cirrhosis than among those without it, though it was used more selectively among the former. Short-term survival following in-hospital CPR remained markedly lower among cirrhosis hospitalizations, while progressively improving among those without cirrhosis. Strategies to increase access to health insurance and improve early identification and control of infection should be explored in future preventive and interventional efforts.

TI "If I have a cancer, it is not my fault I am a refugee": A qualitative
   study with expert stakeholders on cancer care management for Syrian
   refugees in Jordan
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH
AB ` Background
   Noncommunicable diseases including cancer are widespread amongst the 5.6 million Syrian refugees currently hosted in the Middle East. Given its prevalence as the third leading cause of death in Syria, cancer is likely to be an important health burden among Syrian refugees. Against this background, our aim was to describe the clinical, ethical and policy decision-making experiences of health actors working within the current refugee cancer care system; the impact of refugee cancer care health policies on health care providers and policy makers in this context; and provide suggestions for the way delivery of care should be optimised in a sustained emergency situation.
   Methods
   From April-July 2016, we conducted in-depth interviews with 12 purposively sampled health officials and health care workers from the Jordanian Ministry of Health, multilateral donors and international non-governmental organisations. Data were analysed using a framework analysis approach to identify systemic, practical and ethical challenges to optimising care for refugees, through author agreement on issues emerging from the data and those linked more directly to areas of questioning.
   Results
   As has been previously reported, central challenges for policy makers and health providers were the lack of quality cancer prevalence data to inform programming and care delivery for this refugee population, and insufficient health resource allocation to support services. In addition, limited access to international funding for the host country, the absence of long-term funding schemes, and barriers to coordination between institutions and frontline clinicians were seen as key barriers. In this context where economic priorities inevitably drive decision-making on public health policy and individual care provision, frontline healthcare workers and policy makers experienced significant moral distress where duties of care and humanitarian values were often impossible to uphold.
   Conclusions
   Our findings confirm and expand understanding of the challenges involved in resource allocation decisions for cancer care in refugee populations, and highlight these for the particular situation of long term Syrian refugees in Jordan. The insights offered by frontline clinicians and policy makers in this context reveal the unintended personal and moral impact of resource allocation decisions. With many countries facing similar challenges in the provision of cancer care for refugees, the lessons learned from Jordan suggest key areas for policy revision and international investment in developing cancer care policies for refugees internationally.

AB The reduction of synthetic fungicides in agriculture is necessary to guarantee a sustainable production that protects the environment and consumers' health. Downy mildew caused by the oomycete Plasmopara viticola is the major pathogen in viticulture worldwide and responsible for up to 60% of pesticide treatments. Alternatives to reduce fungicides are thus utterly needed to ensure sustainable vineyard-ecosystems, consumer health and public acceptance. Essential oils (EOs) are amongst the most promising natural plant protection alternatives and have shown their antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal properties on several agricultural crops. However, the efficiency of EOs highly depends on timing, application method and the molecular interactions between the host, the pathogen and EO. Despite proven EO efficiency, the underlying processes are still not understood and remain a black box. The objectives of the present study were: a) to evaluate whether a continuous fumigation of a particular EO can control downy mildew in order to circumvent the drawbacks of direct application, b) to decipher molecular mechanisms that could be triggered in the host and the pathogen by EO application and c) to try to differentiate whether essential oils directly repress the oomycete or act as plant resistance primers. To achieve this a custommade climatic chamber was constructed that enabled a continuous fumigation of potted vines with different EOs during long-term experiments. The grapevine (Vitis vinifera) cv Chasselas was chosen in reason of its high susceptibility to Plasmopara viticola. Grapevine cuttings were infected with P. viticola and subsequently exposed to continuous fumigation of different EOs at different concentrations, during 2 application time spans (24 hours and 10 days). Experiments were stopped when infection symptoms were clearly observed on the leaves of the control plants. Plant physiology (photosynthesis and growth rate parameters) were recorded and leaves were sampled at different time points for subsequent RNA extraction and transcriptomics analysis. Strikingly, the Oregano vulgare EO vapour treatment during 24h post-infection proved to be sufficient to reduce downy mildew development by 95%. Total RNA was extracted from leaves of 24h and 10d treatments and used for whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq). Sequenced reads were then mapped onto the V. vinifera and P. viticola genomes. Less than 1% of reads could be mapped onto the P. viticola genome from treated samples, whereas up to 30% reads from the controls mapped onto the P. viticola genome, thereby confirming the visual observation of P. viticola absence in the treated plants. On average, 80% of reads could be mapped onto the V. vinifera genome for differential expression analysis, which yielded 4800 modulated genes. Transcriptomic data clearly showed that the treatment triggered the plant's innate immune system with genes involved in salicylic, jasmonic acid and ethylene synthesis and signaling, activating Pathogenesis-Related-proteins as well as phytoalexin synthesis. These results elucidate EO-host-pathogen interactions for the first time and indicate that the antifungal efficiency of EO is mainly due to the triggering of resistance pathways inside the host plants. This is of major importance for the production and research on biopesticides, plant stimulation products and for resistance-breeding strategies.

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID HEALTH
AB Microcephaly and Zika Virus infection (ZIKV) were declared Public Health Emergencies of International Concern by the World Health Organization in 2016. Brazil was considered the epicenter of the outbreak. However, the occurrence of both ZIKV and microcephaly in Brazil was not evenly distributed across the country. To better understand this phenomenon, we investigate regional characteristics at the municipal level that can be associated with the incidence of microcephaly, our response variable, and its relationship with ZIKV and other predictors. All epidemiological data in this study was provided by the Ministry of Health official database (DATASUS). Microcephaly was only confirmed after birth and the diagnostic was made regardless of the mother's ZIKV status. Using exploratory spatial data analysis and spatial autoregressive Tobit models, our results show that microcephaly incidence is significantly, at 95% confidence level, related not only to ZIKV, but also to access to primary care, population size, gross national product, mobility and environmental attributes of the municipalities. There is also a significant spatial autocorrelation of the dependent variable. The results indicate that municipalities that show a high incidence of microcephaly tend to be clustered in space and that incidence of microcephaly varies considerably across regions when correlated only with ZIKV, i.e. that ZIKV alone cannot explain the differences in microcephaly across regions and their correlation is mediated by regional attributes.

TI Social resistance drives persistent transmission of Ebola virus disease
   in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo: A mixed-methods study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PUBLIC-HEALTH; ATTITUDES; KNOWLEDGE; EPIDEMIC; TRUST
AB Background
   The second largest Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in history is currently raging in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Stubbornly persistent EVD transmission has been associated with social resistance, ranging from passive non-compliance to overt acts of aggression toward EVD reponse teams.
   Methods
   We explored community resistance using focus group discussions and assessed the prevalence of resistant views using standardized questionnaires.
   Results
   Despite being generally cooperative and appreciative of the EVD response (led by the government of DRC with support from the international community), focus group participants provided eyewitness accounts of aggressive resistance to control efforts, consistent with recent media reports. Mistrust of EVD response teams was fueled by perceived inadequacies of the response effort ("herd medicine"), suspicion of mercenary motives, and violation of cultural burial mores ("makeshift plastic morgue"). Survey questionnaires found that the majority of respondents had compliant attitudes with respect to EVD control. Nonetheless, 78/630 (12%) respondents believed that EVD was fabricated and did not exist in the area, 482/630 (72%) were dissatisfied with or mistrustful of the EVD response, and 60/630 (9%) sympathized with perpetrators of overt hostility. Furthermore, 102/630 (15%) expressed non-compliant intentions in the case of EVD illness or death in a family member, including hiding from the health authorities, touching the body, or refusing to welcome an official burial team. Denial of the biomedical discourse and dissatisfaction/mistrust of the EVD response were statistically significantly associated with indicators of social resistance.
   Conclusions
   We concluded that social resistance to EVD control efforts was prevalent among focus group and survey participants. Mistrust, with deep political and historical roots in this area besieged by chronic violence and neglected by the outside world, may fuel social resistance. Resistant attitudes may be refractory to short-lived community engagement efforts targeting the epidemic but not the broader humanitarian crisis in Eastern DRC.

TI Injury severity level and associated factors among road traffic accident
   victims attending emergency department of Tirunesh Beijing Hospital,
   Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: A cross sectional hospital-based study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   Road Traffic Accidents have become an enormous global public health problem killing approximately 1.25 million people and injuring 20 to 50 million others yearly. It is the 10th leading cause of death universally and the number one cause of mortality of the young population between the ages of 5 and 29. Only few studies have been conducted on the severity of road traffic injuries in Ethiopia hence the need for the study.
   Objective To assess injury severity level and associated factors among road traffic accident victims.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional study of patients involved in road traffic accident and attended Tirunesh Beijing hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Victims were consecutively recruited until sample size (164) attained during the study period. Data collectors administered a structured questionnaire. The collected data was then entered and cleaned using Epi info and exported to IBM SPSS for statistical analysis. Independent factors associated with injury severity were assessed using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression.
   Results
   A total of 164 road traffic injury victims were included to the study. Prevalence of severe injury accounted for 36.6% of cases. "can read and write" educational status OR 35.194 (95% CI; 3.325-372.539), sustaining multiple injury OR 18.400(95% CI; 5.402-62.671), sustaining multiple injury type OR 6.955(95% CI; 1.716-28.185) and being transported by ambulance from the scene of accident OR 13.800(95% CI; 1.481-128.635) were the explanatory variables found to have a statistically significant association with severe injury.
   Conclusion
   This study showed road traffic accident is predominantly affecting the economically active, male young population. Not a single victim received pre-hospital care, majority were extracted by bystanders and most used commercial vehicle to be transported to a health institution reflecting the need for improvements in pre-hospital emergency services and socio-economic related infrastructures.

TI Rollout of ShangRing circumcision with active surveillance for adverse
   events and monitoring for uptake in Kenya
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ADULT MALE CIRCUMCISION; RING; SAFETY; TRIAL
AB Introduction
   Since 2011, Kenya has been evaluating ShangRing device for use in its voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) program according to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Compared to conventional surgical circumcision, the ShangRing procedure is shorter, does not require suturing and gives better cosmetic outcomes. After a pilot evaluation of ShangRing in 2011, Kenya conducted an active surveillance for adverse events associated with its use from 2016-2018 to further assess its safety, uptake and to identify any operational bottlenecks to its widespread use based on data from a larger pool of procedures in routine health care settings.
   Methods
   From December 2017 to August 2018, HIV-negative VMMC clients aged 13 years or older seeking VMMC at six sites across five counties in Kenya were offered ShangRing under injectable local anesthetic as an alternative to conventional surgical circumcision. Providers described both procedures to clients before letting them make a choice. Outcome measures recorded for clients who chose ShangRing included the proportions who were clinically eligible, had successful device placement, experienced adverse events (AEs), or failed to return for device removal. Clients failing to return for follow up were sought through phone calls, text messages or home visits to ensure removal and complete information on adverse events.
   Results Out of 3,692 eligible clients 1,079 (29.2%) chose ShangRing; of these, 11 (1.0%) were excluded due to ongoing clinical conditions, 17 (1.6%) underwent conventional surgery due to lack of appropriate device size at the time of the procedure, 97.3% (1051/1079) had ShangRing placement. Uptake of ShangRing varied from 11% to 97% across different sites. There was one severe AE, a failed ShangRing placement (0.1%) managed by conventional wound suturing, plus two moderate AEs (0.2%), post removal wound dehiscence and bleeding, that resolved without sequelae. The overall AE rate was 0.3%. All clients returned for device removal from fifth to eleventh day after placement.
   Conclusion
   ShangRing circumcision is effective and safe in the Kenyan context but its uptake varies widely in different settings. It should be rolled out under programmatic implementation for eligible males to take advantage of its unique benefits and the freedom of choice beyond conventional surgical MMC. Public education on its availability and unique advantages is necessary to optimize its uptake and to actualize the benefit of its inclusion in VMMC programs.

   National Reference Laboratory, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
SO PLOS ONE
LA English

AB Background
   The emergence of multidrug-resistance (MDR), production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, and carbapenemase in members of fermentative gram-negative bacilli are a serious threat to public health.
   Objective
   The aim of this study was to determine the burden of multi-drug resistance, the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), and carbapenemase in fermentative Gramnegative bacilli in Ethiopian Public Health Institute.
   Materials and methods
   A cross-sectional study was carried out from December 2017 to June 2018. Different clinical samples were collected, inoculated, and incubated according to standard protocols related to each sample. Bacterial identification was performed by using the VITEKR 2 compact system using the GNR card. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out by the KirbyBauer disc diffusion method. Production of ESBL and carbapenemase were confirmed by combination disc and modified Hodge Test method respectively.
   Results
   A total of 238 fermentative Gram-negative bacilli were recovered during the study period, among which E.coli were the predominant isolates followed by K. pneumoniae. The highest percentage of antibiotic resistance was noted against ampicillin (100%) followed by trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (81.9%). The isolates showed better sensitivity towards carbapenem drugs. Out of 238 isolates, 94.5% were MDR and of which 8.8% and 0.8% were extensively and pan drug resistant, respectively. Nearly 67% and 2% of isolates were producers of ESBL and carbapenemase, respectively. The isolation rates of MDR, ESBL, and carbapenemase producing stains of the isolates were >= 70% in intensive care unit while the isolation rates in other wards were <= 25%.
   Conclusions
   The findings of this study revealed that the burden of MDR and ESBL was high and carbapenemase producing isolates were also identified which is concerning. This situation warrants a consistent surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of fermentative Gram-negative bacilli and implementation of an efficient infection control program.

TI Mass evacuation and increases in long-term care benefits: Lessons from
   the Fukushima nuclear disaster
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID EAST JAPAN EARTHQUAKE; FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY; EXCESS MORTALITY;
   OLDER-PEOPLE; HEALTH; IMPACT; PREVALENCE; TSUNAMI
AB Background
   Though mass evacuation may increase the need for long-term care (LTC) services, how the need for LTC services increases and how the public LTC system affects it is not well understood. We evaluated changes in public LTC benefits for the people living in the mandatory evacuation areas established after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster and examined the roles of the universal LTC insurance system in Japan.
   Methods
   In order to evaluate the effect of the mandatory evacuation on LTC benefits, we examined the trends of LTC benefits in the Fukushima evacuation group and the nationwide non-evacuation group. We first decomposed per-elderly-individual benefits at the municipality level into the LTC certification rate and per-certified-individual benefits, and then implemented difference-in-differences analysis using these variables as outcomes.
   Results
   Per-elderly-individual benefits significantly increased from 2012 onward in the evacuation group, and this was explained by an increase in the certification rate rather than in per-certified-individual benefits. Increases in per-elderly-individual benefits and the certification rate in the post-disaster period were observed in all but the highest care level, and the corresponding outcomes for the highest care level decreased immediately after the disaster. We also found that the increase in the certification rate had been mostly realized by an increase in the number of certified individuals.
   Conclusions
   The increase in LTC benefits can be associated with the impact of the increase in the number of people newly certified to receive LTC benefits after the mandatory evacuation. In order to cope with the increase in utilization of long-term care and associated costs after disasters in aging societies, both formal long-term care services and social support for informal care for evacuees should be considered important.

TI European public perceptions of homelessness: A knowledge, attitudes and
   practices survey
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; HEALTH; BELIEFS; OPINION; PEOPLE; ADAPTATION; PREVALENCE;
   IMPACT; POLICY; USERS
AB Background
   Addressing Citizen's perspectives on homelessness is crucial for the design of effective and durable policy responses, and available research in Europe is not yet substantive. We aim to explore citizens' opinions about homelessness and to explain the differences in attitudes within the general population of eight European countries: France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden.
   Methods
   A nationally representative telephone survey of European citizens was conducted in 2017. Three domains were investigated: Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices about homelessness. Based on a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), a generalized linear model for clustered and weighted samples was used to probe the associations between groups with opposing attitudes.
   Results
   Response rates ranged from 30.4% to 33.5% (N = 5,295). Most respondents (57%) had poor knowledge about homelessness. Respondents who thought the government spent too much on homelessness, people who are homeless should be responsible for housing, people remain homeless by choice, or homelessness keeps capabilities/empowerment intact (regarding meals, family contact, and access to work) clustered together (negative attitudes, 30%). Respondents who were willing to pay taxes, welcomed a shelter, or acknowledged people who are homeless may lack some capabilities (i.e. agreed on discrimination in hiring) made another cluster (positive attitudes, 58%). Respondents living in semi-urban or urban areas (ORs 1.33 and 1.34) and those engaged in practices to support people who are homeless (ORs > 1.4; p<0.005) were more likely to report positive attitudes, whereas those from France and Poland (p<0.001) were less likely to report positive attitudes.
   Conclusion
   The majority of European citizens hold positive attitudes towards people who are homeless, however there remain significant differences between and within countries. Although it is clear that there is strong support for increased government action and more effective solutions for Europe's growing homelessness crisis, there also remain public opinion barriers rooted in enduring negative perceptions.

TI Accuracy of Determine TB-LAM Ag to detect TB in HIV infected patients
   associated with diagnostic methods used in Brazilian public health units
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; ANTIGEN
AB Background
   Determine TB-LAM Ag (LAM) is a point of care test developed to diagnose tuberculosis (TB). The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of LAM in people living with HIV using Brazilian public health network algorithm for TB diagnosis.
   Methods and findings
   A cross-sectional study design was used to enroll 199 adult patients in two sites in Rio de Janeiro and two in Sao Paulo. The study enrolled HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts <= 200 cells/mm(3) (in the Alere PIMA CD4 assay at study screening), patients coughing for at least 2 weeks or presenting a chest radiography suggestive of TB. LAM, in conjunction with sputum smear microscopy or Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) as compared to Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture, which was used as a reference standard. TB prevalence was 24.6%. Overall accuracy of LAM was 79.9% (73.8%-84.9%), positive and negative predictive values were 62.2% (46.1%-75.9%) and 84% (77.5%-88.8%), respectively. The overall LAM sensitivity was 46.9% (33.7%-60.6%) and specificity was 90.7% (84.9%-94.4%). The best performance of LAM was observed among patients with CD4 counts <= 50 cells/mm(3) (sensitivity = 70.4% and specificity = 85.9%). When 2 respiratory smears were used in conjunction with LAM, sensitivity increased 22%, as compared to just 2 smears. Furthermore, LAM when used in conjunction with two respiratory smears, was as sensitive as compared to a single one. However, no improvement in TB diagnosis occurred when LAM was used with Xpert as compared to Xpert alone. Among 14 LAM false positive tests, Non-Tuberculosis Mycobacteria were isolated in three cases.
   Conclusion
   LAM is a point of care test that increased TB diagnosis in immunosuppressed HIV-infected patients when used in conjunction with smear microscopy, but not when used with Xpert in Brazilian public health network sites. Use of LAM test should be considered in settings where immunosuppressed HIV patients need rapid TB diagnosis.

AB Background Telemedicine services are promoting more access to healthcare. Portugal was an early adopter of telemedicine to overcome both its geological barriers and the shortage of healthcare professionals. The Pediatric Cardiology Service (PCS) at Coimbra University Hospital Centre (CHUC) has been using telemedicine to increase access and coverage since 1998. Their Pediatric Telecardiology Service has been daily connecting CHUC with 13 other Portuguese national hospitals, and regularly connecting with Portuguese-speaking African countries, through a teleconsultation platform. Methods This study aims at exploring the Pediatric Telecardiology Service's evolution, through a comprehensive assessment of the PCS's development, evolution and impact in public health, to better understand the critical factors for implementation and sustainability of telemedicine, in the context of healthcare services digitalization. A case study was performed, with cost-benefit, critical factors and organizational culture assessment. Finally, the Kingdon's framework helped to understand the implementation and scale-up process and the role of policy-making. Results With the total of 32,685 out-patient teleconsultations, growing steadily from 1998 to 2016, the Pediatric Telecardiology Service has reached national and international recognition, being a pioneer and an active promotor of telemedicine. This telemedicine service has saved significant resources, about 1.1 million euros for the health system (e.g. in administrative and logistic costs) and approximately 419 euros per patient (considering an average of 1777 patients per year). PCS presents a dominant "Clan" culture. The Momentum's critical factors for telemedicine service implementation enabled us to understand how barriers were overcome (e.g. political forces). Willingness, perseverance and teamwork, allied with partnership with key stakeholders, were the foundation for professionals' engagement and service networking development. Its positive results, new regulations and the increasing support from the hospital board, set up a window of opportunity to establish a sustainable telemedicine service. Conclusion The Pediatric Telecardiology Service enables real-time communication and the sharing of clinical information, overcoming many barriers (from geographical ones to shortage of healthcare professionals), improving access to specialized care both in Portugal and Africa. Motivation and teamwork, and perseverance, were key for the Pediatric Telecardiology Service to tackle the window of opportunity which created conditions for sustainability.

DT Article
DE Epidemiology; Causality; Big data
ID MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION; ASSOCIATION; RISK; DETERMINANTS; BIRTH
AB BMC Medicine was launched in November 2003 as an open access, open peer-reviewed general medical journal that has a broad remit to publish "outstanding and influential research in all areas of clinical practice, translational medicine, medical and health advances, public health, global health, policy, and general topics of interest to the biomedical and sociomedical professional communities". Here, I discuss the last 15 years of epidemiological research published by BMC Medicine, with a specific focus on how this reflects changes occurring in the field of epidemiology over this period; the impact of 'Big Data'; the reinvigoration of debates about causality; and, as we increasingly work across and with many diverse disciplines, the use of the name 'population health science'. Reviewing all publications from the first volume to the end of 2018, I show that most BMC Medicine papers are epidemiological in nature, and the majority of them are applied epidemiology, with few methodological papers. Good research must address important translational questions that should not be driven by the increasing availability of data, but should take appropriate advantage of it. Over the next 15 years it would be good to see more publications that integrate results from several different methods, each with different sources of bias, in a triangulation framework.

AB Land use influences the prevalence and distribution of ticks due to the intimate relationship of ticks with their environment. This relationship occurs because land use alters two essential tick requirements: vertebrate hosts for blood meals and a suitable microclimate when off-host. Given the risks to human and animal health associated with pathogens transmitted by ticks, there is an ongoing need to understand the impact of environmental drivers on tick distributions. Here, we assessed how landscape features, neighborhood effects, and edges influenced tick occupancy and abundance across an agricultural landscape in southern Africa. We found that Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and Rhipicephalus simus increased in abundance closer to protected savanna, while Haemaphysalis elliptica increased in abundance closer to human habitation. The composition of the landscape surrounding savanna patches also differentially influenced the occupancy of each tick species; H. elliptica was more likely to be found in savanna patches surrounded by subsistence agriculture while R. appendiculatus and R. simus were more likely to be found in savanna surrounded by sugarcane monocultures. At the local scale we found that R. appendiculatus and R. simus avoided savanna edges. The availability of hosts and variation in vegetation structure between commercial agriculture, subsistence agriculture, and savanna likely drove the distribution of ticks at the landscape scale. Understanding how anthropogenic land use influences where ticks occur is useful for land use planning and for assessing public and animal health risks associated with ticks and tick-borne diseases.

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CARE
AB Maternal, fetal, and neonatal health outcomes are interdependent. Designing public health strategies that link fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal outcomes is necessary in order to successfully reduce perinatal and neonatal mortality, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. However, to date, there has been no standardized method for documenting, reporting, and reviewing facility-based stillbirths and neonatal deaths that links to maternal health outcomes would enable a more comprehensive understanding of the burden and determinants of poor fetal and neonatal outcomes. We developed and pilot-tested an adapted RAPID tool, Perinatal-Neonatal Rapid Ascertainment Process for Institutional Deaths (PN RAPID), to systematically identify and quantify facility-based stillbirths and neonatal deaths and link them to maternal health factors in two countries: Liberia and Nepal. This study found an absence of stillbirth timing documented in records, a high proportion of neonatal deaths occurring within the first 24 hours, and an absence of documentation of pregnancy-related and maternal factors that might be associated with fetal and neonatal outcomes. The use of an adapted RAPID methodology and tools was limited by these data gaps, highlighting the need for concurrent strengthening of death documentation through training and standardized record templates.

TI Continuity of care for TB patients at a South African hospital: A
   qualitative participatory study of the experiences of hospital staff
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID TUBERCULOSIS-CONTROL; HEALTH SYSTEMS; CAPE-TOWN; INFECTION; CONTEXT
AB Background
   Ensuring effective clinical management and continuity of TB care across hospital and primary health-care services remains challenging in South Africa. The high burden of TB, coupled with numerous health system problems, influence the TB care delivered by hospital staff.
   Objective
   To understand factors from the perspectives of hospital staff that influence the clinical management and discharge of TB patients, and to elicit recommendations to improve continuity of care for TB patients.
   Design
   Participatory action research was used to engage hospital staff working with TB patients admitted to a central public hospital in the Western Cape province, South Africa. Data were collected through eight focus group discussions with nurses, junior doctors and ward administrators. Data analysis was done using Miles and Huberman's framework to identify emerging patterns and to develop categories with themes and sub-themes. The participants influenced all phases of the research process to inform better practices in TB clinical management and discharge planning at the hospital.
   Results
   The emerging themes and sub-themes were categorized into two overall sections: The clinical care management process and the discharge and referral process. Nurses expressed a fear of exposure to TB and MDR-TB due to challenges in clinical and infection-prevention control. Clinical hierarchies, poor interdisciplinary teamwork, limited task shifting and poor communication interfered with effective clinical and discharge processes. A high workload, staff shortages and inadequate skills resulted in insufficient information and health education for TB patients and their caregivers. Despite awareness of the patients' socio-economic challenges, some aspects of care were not patient-centered, and caregivers were not included in discharge planning. Communication between the hospital and referral points was inefficient and poorly supported by information systems. Hospital staff recommended improved infection prevention and control practices and interdisciplinary teamwork in the hospital, that TB education for patients be integrated with hospital staff functions, with more patient-centered discharge planning, and improved communication across hospitals and primary health care levels.
   Conclusions
   Interdisciplinary teamwork, more patient-centered care, and better communication within the hospital and with primary health-care services are needed for improved continuity of care for TB patients. Further studies on factors contributing to, and interventions to improve, continuity of TB care in similar hospital settings are needed.

AB Background: Individual behavior change is a critical ingredient in efforts to improve global health. Central to the focus on behavior has been a growing understanding of how the human brain makes decisions, from motivations and mindsets to unconscious biases and cognitive shortcuts. Recent work in the field of behavioral economics and related fields has contributed to a rich menu of insights and principles that can be engineered into global health programs to increase impact and reach. However, there is little research on the process of designing and testing interventions informed by behavioral insights.
   Methods: In a study focused on increasing household participation in a Chagas disease vector control campaign in Arequipa, Peru, we applied Datta and Mullainathan's "behavioral design" approach to formulate and test specific interventions. In this Technical Advance article we describe the behavioral design approach in detail, including the Define, Diagnosis, Design, and Test phases. We also show how the interventions designed through the behavioral design process were adapted for a pragmatic randomized controlled field trial.
   Results: The behavioral design framework provided a systematic methodology for defining the behavior of interest, diagnosing reasons for household reluctance or refusal to participate, designing interventions to address actionable bottlenecks, and then testing those interventions in a rigorous counterfactual context. Behavioral design offered us a broader range of strategies and approaches than are typically used in vector control campaigns.
   Conclusions: Careful attention to how behavioral design may affect internal and external validity of evaluations and the scalability of interventions is needed going forward. We recommend behavioral design as a useful complement to other intervention design and evaluation approaches in global health programs.

TI Transforming through leadership: a qualitative study of successful
   American Indian Alaska Native behavioral health leaders
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE American Indian Alaska Natives; Human services; Leadership
ID HISTORICAL TRAUMA; SUBSTANCE-ABUSE
AB Background: Effective leadership is vital in the struggle to decrease the behavioral health disparities between the US population and American Indian Alaska Native (AIAN) communities. AIAN communities have a pre-colonization history of highly effective leadership, yet some AIAN leadership traditions have been eradicated through decades of trauma and genocidal efforts. There is a paucity of research on AIAN public health leadership, and most existing research relies on samples of individuals holding leadership positions rather than individuals purposely selected because of their effectiveness. The aim of the study was to investigate the experiences of successful AIAN behavioral health leaders and present an emerging AIAN public health leadership model.
   Methods: Thirty-eight public health leaders in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA) funded Circles of Care project were observed over the course of their three-year leadership role. Stringent criteria for successful community participatory leadership resulted in the selection of 11 of the 38 leaders for inclusion in the study. Ultimately eight leaders (21% of the population of observed leaders) participated in the study. Semi-structured, one-on-one qualitative interviews were conducted. The methods were informed by phenomenology and the data were analyzed using a thematic content analysis approach.
   Results: The analysis resulted in ten themes: Hopeful Vision for the People, Cultural Humility, Awareness of Historical Context, Purpose Driven Work Behavior, Cultural and Bi-Cultural Knowledge, Trusting a Broader Process, Caring Orientation, Holistic Supervision, Community Centered, and Influence Through Education. Respondents were strongly motivated by a desire to help future generations. They described their success in terms of the application of traditional AIAN values such as cultural humility and community orientation, but also relied heavily on task orientation. An emerging AIAN leadership model is presented.
   Conclusions: It is important to encourage AIAN public health leaders to employ leadership research and models conducted or developed in the context of AIAN communities. The emerging model presented in this study could serve as an initial basis for AIAN leadership training. Given the challenging context of AIAN leadership, the lessons taught by these successful leaders could be adapted for use by leaders in non AIAN settings.

TI Sociodemographic and health care factors in determining immunization
   defaulters among preschool children in Petaling District, Selangor: a
   cross-sectional study in Malaysia
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Immunization; Defaulters; Prevalence; Malaysia
ID INFLUENCING CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATION; MOTHERS REPORTS; VACCINATION;
   ACCURACY; REASONS
AB Background: Immunization is an effective public health intervention to reduce morbidity and mortality among children and it will become more effective if the child can receive the full course of recommended immunization doses. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of childhood immunization defaulters and its associated factors among children below 5 years attending registered child care centers in Petaling District, Selangor.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey among mothers with children below 5 years from 60 registered child care centers in District of Petaling, Selangor. Data was collected by a self-administered questionnaire from a total of 1015 mothers. Simple Logistic Regression, Chi-square or Fisher's exact test were performed to determine the association between individual categorical variables and childhood immunization defaulters. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the predictors of childhood immunization defaulters.
   Results: The study showed that the prevalence rate for defaulting immunization was 20.7%. After adjusting all confounders, six statistically significant predictors of childhood immunization defaulters were determined. They were non-Muslims (aOR = 1.669, 95% CI = 1.173, 2.377, p = 0.004), mothers with diploma and below educational background (aOR = 2.296, 95% CI = 1.460, 3.610, p < 0.0001), multiple children of 5 and above in a family (aOR = 2.656, 95% CI = 1.004, 7.029, p = 0.040), mothers with younger children aged 2 years and below (aOR = 1.700, 95% CI = 1.163, 2.486, p = 0.006), long travelling time of more than 30 min to the immunization health facility (aOR = 2.303, 95% CI = 1.474, 3.599, p < 0.0001) and had delayed at least one of the immunization schedule (aOR = 2.747, 95% CI = 1.918, 3.933, p < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: This study highlights the need of implementation of intervention programs should be intensified to improve the childhood immunization status, focusing on the Non-Muslim community, mothers with low educational level, mothers with multiple children and mothers with children aged 2 years and below. In light of the growing problem of immunization defaulters in Malaysian children, identifying mothers at risk of not completing their children immunization schedule and educating them is an important strategy to recurrent outbreaks of infectious disease in the country.

AB Background: SIPsmartER is a 6-month evidenced-based, multi-component behavioral intervention that targets sugar-sweetened beverages among adults. It consists of three in-person group classes, one teach-back call, and 11 automated phone calls. Given SIPsmartER's previously demonstrated effectiveness, understanding its adoption, implementation, and potential for integration within a system that reaches health disparate communities is important to enhance its public health impact. During this pilot dissemination and implementation trial, SIPsmartER was delivered by trained staff from local health districts (delivery agents) in rural, Appalachian Virginia. SIPsmartER's execution was supported by consultee-centered implementation strategies.
   Methods: In this mixed-methods process evaluation, adoption and implementation indicators of the program and its implementation strategy (e.g., fidelity, feasibility, appropriateness, acceptability) were measured using tracking logs, delivery agent surveys and interviews, and fidelity checklists. Quantitative data were analyzed with descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were inductively coded.
   Results: Delivery agents implemented SIPsmartER to the expected number of cohorts (n = 12), recruited 89% of cohorts, and taught 86% of expected small group classes with > 90% fidelity. The planned implementation strategies were also executed with high fidelity. Delivery agents completing the two-day training, pre-lesson meetings, fidelity checklists, and post-lesson meetings at rates of 86, 75, 100, and 100%, respectively. Additionally, delivery agents completed 5% (n = 3 of 66) and 10% (n = 6 of 59) of teach-back and missed class calls, respectively. On survey items using 6-point scales, delivery agents reported, on average, higher feasibility, appropriateness, and acceptability related to delivering the group classes (range 4.3 to 5.6) than executing missed class and teach-back calls (range 2.6 to 4.6). They also, on average, found the implementation strategy activities to be helpful (range 4.9 to 6.0). Delivery agents identified strengths and weakness related to recruitment, lesson delivery, call completion, and the implementation strategy.
   Conclusions: In-person classes and the consultee-centered implementation strategies were viewed as acceptable, appropriate, and feasible and were executed with high fidelity. However, implementation outcomes for teach-back and missed class calls and recruitment were not as strong. Findings will inform the future full-scale dissemination and implementation of SIPsmartER, as well as other evidence-based interventions, into rural health districts as a means to improve population health.

AB Background: Dental caries is the most common chronic disease in the US and disproportionately affects racial/ethnic minorities. Caries is heritable, and though genetic heterogeneity exists between ancestries for a substantial portion of loci associated with complex disease, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of caries specifically in African Americans has not been performed previously.
   Methods: We performed exploratory GWAS of dental caries in 109 African American adults (age > 18) and 96 children (age 3-12) from the Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia (COHRA1 cohort). Caries phenotypes (DMFS, DMFT, dft, and dfs indices) assessed by dental exams were tested for association with 5 million genotyped or imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), separately in the two age groups. The GWAS was performed using linear regression with adjustment for age, sex, and two principal components of ancestry. A maximum of 1 million adaptive permutations were run to determine empirical significance.
   Results: No loci met the threshold for genome-wide significance, though some of the strongest signals were near genes previously implicated in caries such as antimicrobial peptide DEFB1 (rs2515501; p = 4.54 x 10(-6)) and TUFT1 (rs11805632; p = 5.15 x 10(-6)). Effect estimates of lead SNPs at suggestive loci were compared between African Americans and Caucasians (adults N = 918; children N = 983). Significant (p < 5 x 10(-8)) genetic heterogeneity for caries risk was found between racial groups for 50% of the suggestive loci in children, and 12-18% of the suggestive loci in adults.
   Conclusions: The genetic heterogeneity results suggest that there may be differences in the contributions of genetic variants to caries across racial groups, and highlight the critical need for the inclusion of minorities in subsequent and larger genetic studies of caries in order to meet the goals of precision medicine and to reduce oral health disparities.

SO BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Ante natal care; Timing; Pregnant women; Axum
AB Background: Timely initiation of antenatal care can avoid pregnancy related problems and save lives of mothers and babies. In developing nations, however, only half of the pregnant mothers receive the recommended number of antenatal care visits, and start late in their pregnancy. Thus, the study was conducted to assess the magnitude of timely initiation of antenatal care and factors associated with the timing of antenatal care attendance in Axum in which studies regarding this issue are lacking.
   Methods: An institution based cross-sectional study mixed with qualitative approach was conducted. A total of 386 pregnant women were selected using systematic sampling technique for the quantitative study. In addition, 18 participants were selected purposively for the qualitative part. The quantitative data were collected using structured interviewer administered questionnaire while the qualitative data were collected using an open-ended interview guide. Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS version 22 and the qualitative data were analyzed using Atlas software. Multi-variable logistic regression was used to control the effect of confounders.
   Results: The magnitude of timely attendance of antenatal care was 27.5% (95% CI: 23-32%). Unintended pregnancy (AOR = 2.87; CI 95%: 1.23-6.70), maternal knowledge (AOR = 2.75; CI 95%: 1.07-7.03), educational status of the women (AOR = 2.62; CI 95%: 1.21-5.64), perceived timing of antenatal care (AOR = 3.45; CI 95%: 1.61-7.36), problem in current pregnancy (AOR = 3.56; CI 95%: 1.52-8.48) and advice from significant others (AOR = 2.33; CI 95%: 1.10-4.94) were found significantly associated with timely booking of antenatal care.
   Conclusion: The magnitude of timely attendance of antenatal care is low. Educational status, maternal knowledge, unintended pregnancy, problem in current pregnancy, perceived timing of antenatal care, and advise from significant others were the significant factors for timing of antenatal care. Therefore more effort should be done to increase the knowledge of mothers about importance of antenatal care and timely ante natal care booking.

AB Background: There is broad agreement that antenatal care (ANC) interventions, skilled attendance at birth and management of complications arising after delivery are key strategies that can tackle the high burden of maternal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. In Kenya, utilisation rate of these services has remained low despite a government policy on free maternal care. The present study sought to understand what factors are leading to the low healthcare seeking during pregnancy, child birth and postnatal period in Siaya County in Kenya.
   Methods: Six Focus Group Discussions were conducted with 50 women attending ANC in 6 public primary healthcare facilities. Participants were drawn from a sample of 200 women who were eligible participants in a Conditional Cash Transfer project aimed at increasing utilization of healthcare services during pregnancy and postnatal period. Interviews were conducted at the health facilities, recorded, transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis.
   Results: Multiple factors beyond the commonly reported distance to health facility and lack of transportation and finances explained the low utilization of services. Emergent themes included a lack of understanding of the role of ANC beyond the treatment of regular ailments. Women with no complicated pregnancies therefore missed or went in late for the visits. A missed health visit contributed to future missed visits, not just for ANC but also for facility delivery and postnatal care. The underlying cause of this relationship was a fear of reprimand from the health staff and denial of care. The negative attitude of the health workers explained the pervasive fear expressed by the participants, as well as being on its own a reason for not making the visits. The effect was not just on the woman with the negative experience, but spiraled and affected the decision of other women and their social networks.
   Conclusions: The complexity of the barriers to healthcare visits implies that narrow focused solutions are unlikely to succeed. Instead, there should broad-based solutions that focus on the entire continuum of maternal care with a special focus on ANC. There is an urgent need to shift the negative attitude of healthcare workers towards their clients.

AB Background Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection that has become a major public health concern worldwide. Presently, there is no specific vaccine or treatment available for dengue viral infection. Methods Lignosus rhinocerotis, Pleurotus giganteus, Hericium erinaceus, Schizophyllum commune and Ganoderma lucidium were selected for evaluation of their in-vitro anti-dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) activities. Hot aqueous extracts (HAEs), ethanol extracts (EEs), hexane soluble extracts (HSEs), ethyl acetate soluble extracts (ESEs) and aqueous soluble extracts (ASEs) were prepared from the selected mushrooms. The cytotoxic effects of the extracts were evaluated by the MTT assay. The anti-DENV-2 activities of the extracts were evaluated in three different assays: simultaneous, attachment and penetration assays were perfomed using plaque reduction assays and RT-qPCR assays. The effect of the addition time on viral replication was assessed by the time of addition assay, and a virucidal assay was carried out to evaluate the direct effect of each mushroom extract on DENV-2. The chemical composition of glucans, and the protein and phenolic acid contents in the extracts were estimated. Results We found that the HAEs and ASEs of L. rhinocerotis, P. giganteus, H. erinaceus and S. commune were the least toxic to Vero cells and showed very prominent anti-DENV2 activity. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of the ASEs ranged between 399.2-637.9 mu g/ml, while for the HAEs the range was 312.9-680.6 mu g/ml during simultaneous treatment. Significant anti-dengue activity was also detected in the penetration assay of ASEs (IC50: 226.3-315.4 mu g/ml) and HAEs (IC50: 943.1-2080.2 mu g/ml). Similarly, we observed a marked reduction in the expression levels of the ENV and NS5 genes in the simultaneous and penetration assays of the ASEs and HAEs. Time-of-addition experiments showed that the highest percent of anti-DENV2 activity was observed when the mushroom extracts were added immediately after virus adsorption. None of the extracts exhibited virucidal effect. Chemical composition analysis showed that the major components in the mushroom HAEs and ASEs were glucan (beta D-glucan) and proteins, however, there was no significant correlation between the anti-dengue activity and the concentration of glucans and proteins. Conclusion These findings demonstrated the potential of mushroom extracts as anti-dengue therapeutic agents with less toxic effects.

DE Health facility readiness; Geriatric care; Uganda; health systems;
   Public health facilities; Africa
AB Background As ageing emerges as the next public health threat in Africa, there is a paucity of information on how prepared its health systems are to provide geriatric friendly care services. In this study, we explored the readiness of Uganda's public health system to offer geriatric friendly care services in Southern Central Uganda. Methods Four districts with the highest proportion of old persons in Southern Central Uganda were purposively selected, and a cross-section of 18 randomly selected health facilities (HFs) were visited and assessed for availability of critical items deemed important for provision of geriatric friendly services; as derived from World Health Organization's Age-friendly primary health care centres toolkit. Data was collected using an adapted health facility geriatric assessment tool, entered into Epi-data software and analysed using STATA version 14. Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's post hoc tests were conducted to determine any associations between readiness, health facility level, and district. Results The overall readiness index was 16.92 (SD +/- 4.19) (range 10.8-26.6). This differed across districts; Lwengo 17.91 (SD +/- 3.15), Rakai 17.63 (SD +/- 4.55), Bukomansimbi 16.51 (SD +/- 7.18), Kalungu 13.74 (SD +/- 2.56) and facility levels; Hospitals 26.62, Health centers four (HCIV) 20.05 and Health centers three (HCIII) 14.80. Low readiness was due to poor scores concerning; leadership (0%), financing (0%), human resources (1.7%) and health management information systems (HMIS) (11.8%) WHO building blocks. Higher-level HFs were statistically significantly friendlier than lower-level HFs (p = 0.015). The difference in readiness between HCIIIs and HCIVs was 2.39 (p = 0.025). Conclusion There is a low readiness for public health facilities to provide geriatric friendly care services in Uganda. This is due to gaps in all of the health system building blocks. There is a need for health system reforms in Uganda to adequately cater for service provision for older adults if the 2020 global healthy ageing goal is to be met.

AB Background Detecting avian influenza virus has become an important public health strategy for controlling the emerging infectious disease. Methods The HIS (hospital information system) modified influenza surveillance system (ISS) and a newly built pneumonia surveillance system (PSS) were used to monitor the influenza viruses in Changsha City, China. The ISS was used to monitor outpatients in two sentinel hospitals and to detect mild influenza and avian influenza cases, and PSS was used to monitor inpatients in 49 hospitals and to detect severe and death influenza cases. Results From 2005 to 2016, there were 3,551,917 outpatients monitored by the ISS system, among whom 126,076 were influenza-like illness (ILI) cases, with the ILI proportion (ILI%) of 3.55%. After the HIS was used, the reported incident cases of ILI and ILI% were increased significantly. From March, 2009 to September, 2016, there were 5,491,560 inpatient cases monitored by the PSS system, among which 362,743 were pneumonia cases, with a proportion of 6.61%. Among pneumonia cases, about 10.55% (38,260/362,743) of cases were severe or death cases. The pneumonia incidence increased each year in the city. Among 15 avian influenza cases reported from January, 2005 to September, 2016, there were 26.7% (4/15) mild cases detected by the HIS-modified ISS system, while 60.0% (9/15) were severe or death cases detected by the PSS system. Two H5N1 severe cases were missed by the ISS system in January, 2009 when the PSS system was not available. Conclusions The HIS was able to improve the efficiency of the ISS for monitoring ILI and emerging avian influenza virus. However, the efficiency of the system needs to be verified in a wider area for a longer time span in China.

AB Background Prevention of new HIV infections is a critical public health issue. The highest HIV testing gaps are in men, adolescents 15-19 years old, and adults 40 years and older. Community-based HIV testing services (HTS) can contribute to increased testing coverage and early HIV diagnosis, with HIV self-testing (HIVST) strategies showing promise. Community-based strategies, however, are resource intensive, costly and not widely implemented. A community-led approach to health interventions involves supporting communities to plan and implement solutions to improve their health. This trial aims to determine if community-led delivery of HIVST can improve HIV testing uptake, ART initiation, and broader social outcomes in rural Malawi. Methods The trial uses a parallel arm, cluster-randomised design with group village heads (GVH) and their defined catchment areas randomised (1:1) to community-led HIVST or continue with the standard of the care (SOC). As part of the intervention, informal community health cadres are supported to plan and implement a seven-day HIVST campaign linked to HIV treatment and prevention. Approximately 12 months after the initial campaign, intervention GVHs are randomised to lead a repeat HIVST campaign. The primary outcome includes the proportion of adolescents 15-19 years old who have tested for HIV in their lifetime. Secondary outcomes include recent testing in adults 40 years and older and men; ART initiation; knowledge of HIV prevention; and HIV testing stigma. Outcomes will be measured through cross-sectional surveys and clinic registers. Economic evaluation will determine the cost per person tested, cost per person diagnosed, and incremental cost effectiveness ratio. Discussion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first trial to assess the effectiveness of community-led HTS, which has only recently been enabled by the introduction of HIVST. Community-led delivery of HIVST is a promising new strategy for providing periodic HIV testing to support HIV prevention in rural communities. Further, introduction of HIVST through a community-led framework seems particularly apt, with control over healthcare concurrently devolved to individuals and communities.

AB Background The emergence of Drug-Resistance Tuberculosis (DR-TB) is an increasing global public health problem. Lost to Follow-up (LTFU) from DR-TB treatment remains a major barrier to tuberculosis epidemic control and better treatment outcome. In Ethiopia, evidences on the incidence and predictors of LTFU are scarce. Thus, this study aimed to determine the incidence and identify the predictors of LTFU among DR-TB patients. Methods A retrospective follow-up study was conducted among a total of 332 DR-TB patients at the University of Gondar comprehensive specialized hospital. Data were retrieved from patient records from September 2010 to December 2017 and entered in to Epi-data 4.2.0.0 and analysed using Stata14.1 software. The risk was estimated using the Nelson-Aalen cumulative hazard curve. A log-rank test was used for survival comparisons between categories of independent variables. The Gompertz regression model was fitted, and hazard ratio with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to measure the strength of associations. Variables with less than 0.05 p-values in the multivariable model were considered as significantly associated with LTFU. Results Among a total of 332 patient records reviewed, 206 (62.05%) were male. The median age was 30 years (Inter Quartile Range (IQR): 23-40). Forty-one (12.35%) of the participants had no history of TB treatment, while a quarter of were TB-HIV co-infected. Closely all (92.17%) of the patients had pulmonary tuberculosis. The median follow up time was 20.37 months (IQR: 11.02, 21.80). Thirty-six (10.84%) patients were lost from follow-up with an incidence rate of 6.47 (95% CI: 4.67, 8.97)/1000 Person Months (PM). Homelessness (Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR) =2.51, 95%CI: 1.15, 5.45) and treatment enrolment year from 2013 to 2014 (AHR = 3.25, 95% CI: 1.30, 8.13) were significant predictors of LTFU. Conclusion This study indicated that LTFU among DR-TB registered patients was high in the first six months compared to subsequent months. Homelessness and year of treatment enrolment were independent predictors of LTFU, requiring more economic support to patients in order to ensure treatment completion. This result can be generalized to patients who are using DR-TB treatment in similar settings.

AB Background Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major public health problem in China. Over a decade has passed since the last National Hepatitis Seroepidemiological Survey was conducted in 2006. The lack of updated data on hepatitis B in China makes assessing the current prevalence and burden of the disease inadequate. In response to the above situation, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to provide a better understanding of hepatitis B epidemiology in the general population of China. Methods A systematic search was conducted in international databases (Medline through PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, Web of Science) and national databases (CBM, CNKI, WanFang Data) to retrieve primary studies published between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2017. The pooled prevalence of HBV infection and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Quality assessment, heterogeneity testing and publication bias assessment were also performed. Results Of the 27 studies included in the meta-analysis, the pooled estimated prevalence of HBV infection in the general population of China from 2013 to 2017 was 6.89% (95% CI:5.84-7.95%), which could be extrapolated to an estimated population of 84 million living with HBsAg in 2018. The prevalence of HBV infection in males was higher than that in females (5.88% vs 5.05%), and rural areas had a higher prevalence than urban areas (5.86% vs 3.29%). The highest prevalence of HBV infection was reported in Western provinces (8.92, 95% CI: 7.19-10.64%). In adults older than 20 years, the prevalence of HBV infection was approximately 7%, which was higher than that in children. Conclusion The prevalence of HBV infection in the general population of China was classified as higher intermediate prevalence (5-7.99%), of which more than 90% of the HBV infection population included adults older than 20 years. The blocking of mother-to-infant hepatitis B transmission and plans involving timely birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine within 24 h should be implemented. Additionally, improving the quality of life and survival rate of the infected population through antiviral therapy and high-risk adult vaccination will be the priority of our future work. Moreover, various control measures should be implemented in different provinces across China.

AB Background The introduction of highly effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for hepatitis C has led to calls to eliminate it as a public health threat through treatment-as-prevention. Recent studies suggest it is possible to develop a vaccine to prevent hepatitis C. Using a mathematical model, we examined the potential impact of a hepatitis C vaccine on the feasibility and cost of achieving the global WHO elimination target of an 80% reduction in incidence by 2030 in the era of DAA treatment. Methods The model was calibrated to 167 countries and included two population groups (people who inject drugs (PWID) and the general community), features of the care cascade, and the coverage of health systems to deliver services. Projections were made for 2018-2030. Results The optimal incidence reduction strategy was to implement test and treat programmes among PWID, and in settings with high levels of community transmission undertake screening and treatment of the general population. With a vaccine available, the optimal strategy was to include vaccination within test and treat programmes, in addition to vaccinating adolescents in settings with high levels of community transmission. Of the 167 countries modelled, between 0 and 48 could achieve an 80% reduction in incidence without a vaccine. This increased to 15-113 countries if a 75% efficacious vaccine with a 10-year duration of protection were available. If a vaccination course cost US$200, vaccine use reduced the cost of elimination for 66 countries (40%) by an aggregate of US$7.4 (US$6.6-8.2) billion. For a US$50 per course vaccine, this increased to a US$9.8 (US$8.7-10.8) billion cost reduction across 78 countries (47%). Conclusions These findings strongly support the case for hepatitis C vaccine development as an urgent public health need, to ensure hepatitis C elimination is achievable and at substantially reduced costs for a majority of countries.

AB Background Major depressive disorder is one of the most prevalent and disabling forms of mental illness in the general population. One public health strategy that may reduce the disease burden is early identification and prevention - identifying people who are at high risk and intervening to prevent symptoms from progressing into a major depressive episode (MDE). Multivariable risk predictive algorithms (MVRP) have been developed to estimate personalized risk (probability) of an MDE. The purpose of this trial is to answer the questions: (1) Does disclosure of personalized depression risk information promote high-risk individuals to take preventive actions? (2) Will disclosure of personalized depression risk information negatively affect the mental health of those at high risk? Methods We are recruiting 350 high-risk men and 350 high-risk women across the country. Individuals are eligible, if they: (1) are 18 years or older, (2) have not had a depressive episode in the past two months, (3) are at high risk of MDE based on the MVRPs (predicted risk of 6.5% + for men and of 11.2% + for women), (4) can communicate in either English or French, and (5) agree to be contacted for follow-up interviews. The MVRPs were developed and validated using longitudinal data from over 10,000 Canadians across the country. Eligible participants are randomized into (1) the control group, and (2) the group receiving personalized depression risk information. The participants are assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months regarding accuracy of risk perception, use of self-help strategies and changes in psychological distress and functioning. Qualitative interviews are conducted in sub-samples of the intervention groups to explore how the personalized information affects risk perception, self-help behaviors and mental health. Discussion MVRPs can be used for risk stratification and planning preventive actions. The personalized risk information produced by MVRPs may also empower users to actively engage in self-management. This trial will contribute to the knowledge base about the potential health benefits and psychological harms associated with the provision of personalized depression risk information that will inform future implementation and patient-physician communication in the clinical settings.

ID STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS; HEALTH-CARE; TRUST
AB Background: Controversies arise over abortion, assisted dying and conscientious objection (CO) in healthcare. The purpose of the study was to examine the relationship between attitudes towards these bioethical dilemmas, and secularity and religiosity.
   Method: Data were drawn from a 2017 web-based survey of a representative sample of 1615 Norwegian adults. Latent moderated structural equations modelling was used to develop a model of the relationship between attitudes.
   Results: The resulting model indicates that support for abortion rights is associated with pro-secular attitudes and is a main "driver" for support for assisted dying and opposition to conscientious objection.
   Conclusions: This finding should be regarded as a hypothesis which ought to be tested in other populations. If the relationship is robust and reproduced elsewhere, there are important consequences for CO advocates who would then have an interest in disentangling the debate about CO from abortion; and for health systems who ought to consider carefully how a sound policy on CO can safeguard both patient trust in the services and the moral integrity of professionals. It is suggested that if religiosity wanes and pro-secular and pro-abortion attitudes become more widespread, support for CO might decline, putting into question whether present policies of toleration of conscientious refusals will remain acceptable to the majority.

AB Background: Asthma is an extensive public health problem and inadequate disease control is not uncommon. Individuals' self-perceived barriers to medical treatment for the entire treatment chain (from seeking care for symptoms to using a medicine) have seldom been studied for chronic diseases such as asthma. The aim of this study was to explore self-perceived barriers to medical treatment among individuals with asthma within the framework of AAAQ (availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality).
   Methods: Individuals with asthma visiting the asthma nurse at a primary health care centre, and who currently had a prescription for anti-asthmatic medicines, were informed about the study. The nurse asked the persons for their consent to be contacted by an interviewer. The interview guide was constructed from the elements of AAAQ exploring self-perceived barriers to asthma treatment. Interviews were conducted in Swedish, English, Arabic and Persian. They were transcribed verbatim and a manifest content analysis was conducted.
   Results: Fourteen interviews were conducted. There was a large variation in both age and reported number of years with asthma. Self-perceived barriers to asthma treatment were experienced throughout the whole treatment chain. Barriers that emerged were health care accessibility, perceived quality of care, beliefs about medicines, life circumstances, knowledge gap about asthma and medicines, practical obstacles to using medicines, and experiences with treatment. The self-perceived barriers cover all four elements of AAAQ, but there are also some barriers that go beyond those elements (life circumstances and practical obstacles to using medicines).
   Conclusions: Self-perceived barriers among individuals with asthma cover the whole treatment chain. We want to highlight the inadequate information/education of patients leading to knowledge gaps about both disease and the effect of medicines, and also the perceived unsatisfactory treatment at the PHCC, which could partly be counteracted if patients know what to expect from health care visits.

ID NEED; SEX
AB Introduction
   Mozambique continues to have a significant burden of HIV. Developing strategies to control the HIV epidemic remains a key priority for the Mozambican public health community. The primary aim of this study was to determine HIV prevalence and risk behavior among males and females screened for a HIV vaccine preparedness study in Maputo, Mozambique.
   Methods
   Male and female participants between 18-35 years old were recruited from the general community and from female sex worker (FSW) and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) associations in Maputo. All participants were screened for HIV and a questionnaire was administered to each participant to assess HIV risk behavior.
   Results
   A total of 1125 adults were screened for HIV infection, among whom 506 (45%) were male. Among men, 5.7% reported having had sex with men (MSM) and 12% of female participants reported having exchanged sex for money, goods or favors in the past 3 months. The overall HIV prevalence was 10.4%; 10.7% of women, and 10.1% of men were HIV infected; 41.4% of MSM were seropositive. HIV infection was associated with older age (25-35 years old) (OR: 6.13, 95% CI: 3.01, 12.5), MSM (OR: 9.07, 95% CI: 3.85, 21.4), self-perception of being at high-risk for HIV (OR: 3.99, 95% CI: 1.27, 12.5) and self-report of a history of a diagnosis of sexually transmitted infection (OR: 3.75, 95% CI: 1.57, 8.98).
   Conclusion
   In our cohort, HIV prevalence was much higher among MSM compared to the overall prevalence. Behavioral factors were found to be more associated with HIV prevalence than demographic factors. The study findings demonstrate the critical importance of directing services to minority communities, such as MSM, when prevention strategies are being devised for the general population.

Since no study has been conducted in Lebanon on this topic, our objective was to assess the knowledge, attitude and behaviors towards public stigma of mental health diseases, among a sample of the Lebanese population.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional study, conducted between November 2017 and May 2018, enrolled 2289 participants. The Mental Health Knowledge Schedule (MAKS), the Community Attitudes toward Mental Illness (CAMI) and the Reported and Intended Behavior Scale (RIBS) were used to assess knowledge, attitude and behaviors toward mental illness respectively. The 25th, 50th and 75th percentile of the MAKS, CAMI and RIBS scales scores were considered as cutoff points for low, medium and high scores respectively.
   Results
   A high knowledge score was found in 33.0% of the participants, whereas a high attitude score and a higher behavior score were found in 32.2% and 26.9% of the participants respectively. Living in North Lebanon (Beta = 1.331) and being familiar with a non -close person with mental illness (Beta = 0.811) were associated with higher knowledge of mental illness (higher MAKS score), whereas living in Bekaa (Beta = -8.693) and being 70 years old and above (Beta = -5.060) were associated with lower knowledge toward mental illness (lower MAKS score). Higher knowledge of mental illness (higher MAKS score) (Beta = 0.670), having a high level of education (university (Beta = 8.785), secondary (Beta = 6.084) and technical (Beta = 5.677)) were associated with less stigmatizing attitudes (higher CAMI scale). Being familiar with close people with mental illness (Beta = 0.577), less stigmatizing attitudes (higher CAMI scale) (Beta = 0.077) and higher knowledge of mental illness (higher MAKS score) (Beta = 0.115) were associated with higher favorable behaviors (higher RIBS score), whereas knowing a non -close person who have a mental illness (Beta = -0.720) was associated with lower favorable behaviors (lower RIBS score).
   Conclusion
   A mass media awareness campaigns that could transmit health messages to a wide public audience in the country to fight stigma toward mental illness, seems warranted.

TI Spatial distribution of breast cancer in Sudan 2010-2016
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among females worldwide including Sudan. The aim of this study was to determine the spatial distribution of breast cancer in Sudan.
   Materials and methods
   A facility based cross-sectional study was implemented in eighteen histopathology laboratories distributed in the three localities of Khartoum State on a sample of 4630 Breast Cancer cases diagnosed during the period 2010-2016. A master database was developed through Epi Info (TM) 7.1.5.2 for computerizing the data collected: the facility name, type (public or private), and its geo-location (latitude and longitude). Personal data on patients were extracted from their respective medical records (name, age, marital status, ethnic group, state, locality, administrative unit, permanent address and phone number, histopathology diagnosis). The data was summarized through SPSS to generate frequency tables for estimating prevalence and the geographical information system (ArcGIS 10.3) was used to generate the epidemiological distribution maps. ArcGIS 10.3 spatial analysis features were used to develop risk maps based on the kriging method.
   Results
   Breast cancer prevalence was 3.9 cases per 100,000 female populations. Of the 4423 cases of breast cancer, invasive breast carcinoma of no special type (NST) was the most frequent (79.5%, 3517/4423) histopathological diagnosis. The spatial analysis indicated as high risk areas for breast cancer in Sudan the States of Nile River, Northern, Red Sea, White Nile, Northern and Southern Kordofan..
   Conclusions
   The attempt to develop a predictive map of breast cancer in Sudan revealed three levels of risk areas (risk, intermediate and high risk areas); regardless the risk level, appropriate preventive and curative health interventions with full support from decision makers are urgently needed.

   SAFETY; HOME
AB Background
   Globally, neonatal deaths remain a major public health challenge and account for the majority of deaths occurring among children under five years of age. Despite Nepal's significant achievements in meeting the maternal and child health targets of the Millennium Development Goals, an estimated 23,000 Nepalese children under five years die every year, with three out of five babies dying within the first 28 days of life. This study therefore aimed to examine the level of knowledge and practices of newborn care among Nepalese mothers in the upper Himalayas and the factors associated with these.
   Materials and methods
   A community based cross-sectional study was conducted among 302 randomly selected mothers with children under two years of age in Tripurasundari Municipality of Dolpa district, an upper Himalayan region of Nepal. Mothers were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires. Mean score for knowledge and Bloom's criteria for practice were considered to categorize newborn care knowledge and practices. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the newborn care knowledge and practices.
   Results
   In this study, 147 (48.7%) of the mothers were found to have inadequate knowledge of newborn care, while 102 (33.8%) mothers had reported unsatisfactory newborn care practices. Mothers with at least secondary level of formal education were more likely to possess adequate newborn care knowledge compared to mothers who never attended school (AOR 4.93 at 95% CI 1.82-13.33). Mothers whose first pregnancy occurred between the ages of 20-24 years (AOR 3.89 at 95% CI 1.81-8.37) were also more likely to possess adequate newborn care knowledge, compared to mothers with a younger age at first pregnancy. Furthermore, mothers who had completed at least four ANC visits (AOR 2.89 at 95% CI 1.04-7.96), mothers who had completed three PNC visits (AOR 2.79 at 95% CI 1.16-6.72) and mothers who reported that their nearest health facility was less than one hour (30-59 minutes) walking distance (AOR 3.66 at 95% CI 1.43-9.33) had higher odds of having adequate newborn care knowledge. Similarly, mothers whose household monthly income was more than $100 (AOR 4.17 at 95% CI 1.75-9.69), mothers who had completed three PNC visits (AOR 3.27 at 95% CI 1.16-9.20) and mothers with adequate newborn care knowledge (AOR 15.35 at 95% CI 5.82-40.47) were found to be more likely to practice a satisfactory level of newborn care practices in adjusted analysis.
   Conclusion
   The study revealed high prevalence of inadequate newborn care and knowledge amongst mothers in upper Himalayan dwellings. Approximately one third of all interviewed mothers practiced suboptimal newborn care. The results indicate an urgent need to increase awareness of neonatal services available to mothers and to prioritize investments by local governments in neonatal health services, in order to improve accessibility and quality of care for mothers and newborns.

TI What will it take for the Global Plan priority countries in Sub-Saharan
   Africa to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV?
SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID PREVENTION; EXPERIENCE; WOMEN; CARE
AB Background The 2016 'Start Free, Stay Free, AIDS Free' global agenda, builds on the 2011-2015 'Global Plan'. It prioritises 22 countries where 90% of the world's HIV-positive pregnant women live and aims to eliminate vertical transmission of HIV (EMTCT) and to keep mothers alive. By 2019, no Global Plan priority country had achieved EMTCT; however, 11 non-priority countries had. This paper synthesises the characteristics of the first four countries validated for EMTCT, and of the 21 Global Plan priority countries located in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We consider what drives vertical transmission of HIV (MTCT) in the 21 SSA Global Plan priority countries. Methods A literature review, using PubMed, Science direct and the google search engine was conducted to obtain global and national-level information on current HIV-related context and health system characteristics of the first four EMTCT-validated countries and the 21 SSA Global Plan priority countries. Data representing only one clinic, hospital or region were excluded. Additionally, key global experts working on EMTCT were contacted to obtain clarification on published data. We applied three theories (the World Health Organisation's building blocks to strengthen health systems, van Olmen's Health System Dynamics framework and Baral's socio-ecological model for HIV risk) to understand and explain the differences between EMTCT-validated and non-validated countries. Additionally, structural equation modelling (SEM) and linear regression were used to explain associations between infant HIV exposure, access to antiretroviral therapy and two outcomes: (i) percent MTCT and (iii) number of new paediatric HIV infections per 100 000 live births (paediatric HIV case rate). Results EMTCT-validated countries have lower HIV prevalence, less breastfeeding, fewer challenges around leadership, governance within the health sector or country, infrastructure and service delivery compared with Global Plan priority countries. Although by 2016 EMTCT-validated countries and Global Plan priority countries had adopted a public health approach to HIV prevention, recommending lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all HIV-positive pregnant and lactating women, EMCT-validated countries had also included contact tracing such as assisted partner notification, and had integrated maternal and child health (MCH) and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services, with services for HIV infection, sexually transmitted infections, and viral hepatitis. Additionally, Global Plan priority countries have limited data on key SRH indicators such as unmet need for family planning, with variable coverage of antenatal care, HIV testing and triple antiretroviral therapy (ART) and very limited contact tracing. Structural equation modelling (SEM) and linear regression analysis demonstrated that ART access protects against percent MTCT (p<0.001); in simple linear regression it is 53% protective against percent MTCT. In contrast, SEM demonstrated that the case rate was driven by the number of HIV exposed infants (HEI) i.e. maternal HIV prevalence (p<0.001). In linear regression models, ART access alone explains only 17% of the case rate while HEI alone explains 81% of the case rate. In multiple regression, HEI and ART access accounts for 83% of the case rate, with HEI making the most contribution (coef. infant HIV exposure=82.8, 95% CI: 64.6, 101.1, p<0.001 vs coef. ART access=-3.0, 95% CI: -6.2, 0.3, p=0.074).
   Conclusion Reducing infant HIV exposure, is critical to reducing the paediatric HIV case rate; increasing ART access is critical to reduce percent MTCT. Additionally, our study of four validated countries underscores the importance of contact tracing, strengthening programme monitoring, leadership and governance, as these are potentially-modifiable factors.

AB Background Eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV is a global public health target. Robust, feasible methodologies to measure population level impact of programmes to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) are needed in high HIV prevalence settings. We present a summary of the protocol of the South African PMTCT Evaluation (SAPMTCTE) with its revision over three repeated rounds of the survey, 2010-2014. Methods Three cross sectional surveys (2010, 2011-2012 and 2012-2013) were conducted in 580 primary health care immunisation service points randomly selected after stratified multistage probability proportional to size sampling. All infants aged 4-8 weeks receiving their six-week immunisation at a sampled facility on the day of the visit were eligible to participate. Trained research nurses conducted interviews and took infant dried blood spot (iDBS) samples for HIV enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and total nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Interviews were conducted using mobile phones and iDBS were sent to the National Health Laboratory for testing. All findings were adjusted for study design, non-response, and weighted for number of South African live-birth in each study round. In 2012 a national closed cohort of these 4 to 8-week old infants testing EIA positive (HIV Exposed Infants) from the 2012-2013 cross-sectional survey was established to estimate longer-term PMTCT impact to 18 months. Follow-up analyses were to estimate weighted cumulative MTCT until 18 months, postnatal MTCT from 6 weeks until 18 months and a combined outcome of MTCT-or-death, using a competing risks model, with death as a competing risk. HIV-free survival was defined as a child surviving and HIV-negative up to 18 months or last visit seen. A weighted cumulative incidence analysis was conducted, adjusting for survey design effects. Discussion In the absence of robust high-quality routine medical recording systems, in the context of a generalised HIV epidemic, national surveys can be used to monitor PMTCT effectiveness; however, monitoring long-term outcomes nationally is difficult due to poor retention in care.

DE Early infant diagnosis of HIV; Turn-around times; Laboratory
   transportation system; Human resources; SAPMTCTE; PMTCT
AB Background In June 2015, South Africa introduced early infant HIV diagnosis (EID) at birth and ten weeks postpartum. Guidelines recommended return of birth results within a week and ten weeks postpartum results within four weeks. Task shifting was also suggested to increase service coverage. This study aimed to understand factors affecting return of EID results to caregivers. Methods Secondary analysis of data gathered from 571 public-sector primary health care facilities (PHCs) during a nationally representative situational assessment, was conducted. The assessment was performed one to three months prior to facility involvement in the 2010 evaluation of the South African programme to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission (SAPMTCTE). Self-reported infrastructural and human resource EID-related data were collected from managers and designated staff using a structured questionnaire. The main outcome variable was 'EID turn-around-time (TAT) to caregiver' (caregiver TAT), measured as reported number of weeks from infant blood draw to caregiver receipt of results. This was dichotomized as either short (<= 3 weeks) or delayed (> 3 weeks) caregiver TAT. Logit-based risk difference analysis was used to assess factors associated with short caregiver TAT. Analysis included TAT to facility (facility TAT), defined as reported number of weeks from infant blood draw to facility receipt of results. Results Overall, 26.3% of the 571 PHCs reported short caregiver TAT. In adjusted analyses, short caregiver TAT was less achieved when facility TAT was > 7 days (versus <= 7 days) (adjusted risk difference (aRD): - 0.2 (95% confidence interval - 0.3-(- 0.1)), p = 0.006 for 8-14 days and - 0.3 (- 0.5-(- 0.1)), p = 0.006 for > 14 days), and in facilities with staff nurses (compared to those without) (aRD: - 9.4 (- 16.6-(- 2.2), p = 0.011). Conclusion Although short caregiver TAT for EID was only reported in approximately 26% of facilities, these facilities demonstrate that achieving EID TAT of <= 3 weeks is possible, making timely ART initiation within 3 weeks of diagnosis feasible within the public health sector. Our adjusted analyses underpin the need for quick return of results to facilities. They also raise questions around staff mentoring: we hypothesise that facilities with staff nurses were likely to have fewer professional nurses, and thus inadequate senior support.

AB Background A high proportion of African women utilize family planning (FP) services. Accordingly, incorporating HIV testing into FP services may strategically target the first WHO 90-90-90 goal of 90% of people living with HIV knowing their status. Methods The objective of this analysis was to determine the proportion of new FP clients counseled and tested for HIV, as well as correlates of HIV testing, in a random sample of 58 FP clinics in Mombasa County, Kenya. Structured interviews of FP clinic managers collected data on characteristics of FP clinics and staff. Study staff performed a 3-month review of FP registers, summarizing new client HIV testing and counseling (HTC). Because overall rates of HTC were quite low, a binary variable was created comparing clinics performing any HIV counseling and/or testing to clinics performing none. Generalized linear models were used to calculate prevalence ratios (PR) and identify correlates of HTC. Factors associated with any HTC with a p-value < 0.10 in univariate analysis were included in a multivariate analysis. Results Of the 58 FP clinics, 26 (45%) performed any counseling for HIV testing, and 23 (40%) performed any HIV testing. Counseling for HIV testing was conducted for 815/4389 (19%) new clients, and HIV testing was performed for 420/4389 (10%). Clinics without trained HIV testing providers uniformly did not conduct HIV counseling and/or testing (0/12 [0%]), while 27/46 (59%) of clinics with >= 1 provider performed some HTC (p < 0.001). In the subset of 46 clinics with >= 1 trained HIV testing provider, correlates of performing HTC included being a public versus non-public clinic (PR 1.70 95%CI 1.01-2.88), and having an HIV comprehensive care center (CCC) onsite (PR 2.05, 95%CI 1.04-4.06). Conclusion Trained HIV testing providers are crucial for FP clinics to perform any HTC. Approaches are needed to increase routine HTC in FP clinics including staffing changes and/or linkages with other testing services (in standalone VCT services or lab facilities) in order to improve the implementation of existing national guidelines. A future cluster randomized trial is planned to test an implementation strategy, the Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach (SAIA) to increase HTC in FP clinics.

AB Background Combined lifestyle interventions (CLIs) are designed to help people who are overweight or obese maintain a healthy new lifestyle. The CooL intervention is a CLI in the Netherlands, in which lifestyle coaches counsel adults and children (and/or their parents) who are obese or at high risk of obesity to achieve a sustained healthier lifestyle. The intervention consists of coaching on lifestyle in group and individual sessions, addressing the topics of physical activity, dietary behaviours, sleep, stress management and behavioural change. The aim of this study was to evaluate the implementation process of the Coaching on Lifestyle (CooL) intervention and its facilitating and impeding factors. Methods Mixed methods were used in this action-oriented study. Both quantitative (number of referrals, attendance lists of participants and questionnaires) and qualitative (group and individual interviews, observations, minutes and open questions) data were collected among participants, lifestyle coaches, project group members and other stakeholders. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research was used to analyse the data. Results CooL was evaluated by stakeholders and participants as an accessible and useful programme, because of its design and content and the lifestyle coaches' approach. However, stakeholders indicated that the lifestyle coaches need to become more familiar in the health care network and public sectors in the Netherlands. Lifestyle coaching is a novel profession and the added value of the lifestyle coach is not always acknowledged by all health care providers. Lifestyle coaches play a crucial role in ensuring the impact of CooL by actively networking, using clear communication materials and creating stakeholders' support and understanding. Conclusion The implementation process needs to be strengthened in terms of creating support for and providing clear information about lifestyle coaching. The CooL intervention was implemented in multiple regions, thanks to the efforts of many stakeholders. Lifestyle coaches should engage in networking activities and entrepreneurship to boost the implementation process. It takes considerable time for a lifestyle coach to become fully incorporated in primary care.

AB Background Adherence to treatment, a public health issue, is of particular importance in chronic disease therapies. Primary care practices offer ideal venues for the effective care and management of these conditions. The aim of this study is to assess adherence to treatment and related-factors among patients with chronic conditions in primary care settings. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 299 adult patients with >= 1 chronic condition(s) and prescribed medication in primary healthcare centers of Spain. The Morisky-Green-Levine questionnaire was used to assess medication adherence via face-to-face interviews. Crude and adjusted multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyze factors associated with adherence using the Multidimensional Model proposed by the World Health Organization - social and economic, healthcare team and system-related, condition-related, therapy-related, and patient-related factors. Results The proportion of adherent patients to treatment was 55.5%. Older age (adjusted odds ratio 1.31 per 10-year increment, 95% CI 1.01-1.70), lower number of pharmacies used for medication refills (0.65, 95% CI 0.47-0.90), having received complete treatment information (3.89, 95% CI 2.09-7.21), having adequate knowledge about medication regimen (4.17, 95% CI 2.23-7.80), and self-perception of a good quality of life (2.17, 95% CI 1.18-4.02) were independent factors associated with adherence. Conclusions Adherence to treatment for chronic conditions remained low in primary care. Optimal achievement of appropriate levels of adherence through tailored multifaceted interventions will require attention to the multidimensional factors found in this study, particularly those related to patients' education and their information needs.

TI A rare case of Colistin-resistant Salmonella Enteritidis meningitis in

SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES

DT Article
DE Salmonella Enteritidis; Non-typhoidal Salmonella; Meningitis; HIV;
   Colistin resistance
ID DISEASE
AB Background Non-typhoidal salmonellae (NTS) have been associated with invasive disease, notably meningitis, in immunocompromised individuals. Infections of this nature carry high rates of morbidity and mortality. Colistin resistance in salmonellae is a rare finding, more so in an invasive isolate such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Colistin resistance has important infection control implications and failure to manage this phenomenon may lead to the loss of our last line of defence against multi-drug resistant Gram-negative organisms. To our knowledge, this is the first reported clinical case of colistin-resistant Salmonella Enteritidis meningitis in South Africa. Case presentation We report a case of a young male patient with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who presented to hospital with symptoms of meningitis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultured a Salmonella Enteritidis strain. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of the isolate, revealed the strain to be colistin resistant. Despite early and aggressive antimicrobial therapy, the patient succumbed to the illness after a short stay in hospital. Subsequent genomic analysis of the isolate showed no presence of the mcr genes or resistance-conferring mutations in phoPQ, pmrAB, pmrHFIJKLME/arnBCADTEF, mgrB, and acrAB genes, suggesting the presence of a novel colistin resistance mechanism. Conclusion Invasive non-typhoidal salmonellae infection should be suspected in patients with advanced immunosuppression who present with clinical features of meningitis. Despite early and appropriate empiric therapy, these infections are commonly associated with adverse outcomes to the patient. Combination therapy with two active anti-Salmonella agents may be a consideration in the future to overcome the high mortality associated with NTS meningitis. Colistin resistance in clinical Salmonella isolates, although a rare finding at present, has significant public health and infection control implications. The causative mechanism of resistance should be sought in all cases.

TI Assessing the impact of a research funder's recommendation to consider
   core outcome sets
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID TRIALS; DOMAINS
AB Background
   Core outcome sets (COS) have the potential to reduce waste in research by improving the consistency of outcomes measured in trials of the same health condition. However, this reduction in waste will only be realised through the uptake of COS by clinical trialists. Without uptake, the continued development of COS that are not implemented may add to waste in research. Funders of clinical trials have the potential to have an impact on COS uptake by recommending their use to those applying for funding. The aim of our study was to assess the extent to which applicants followed the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment (NIHR HTA) programme's recommendation to search for a COS to include in their clinical trial.
   Methods and findings
   We examined the outcomes section and detailed project descriptions of all 95 researcher-led primary research applications submitted to the NIHR HTA between January 2012, when the recommendation to search for a COS was included in the guidance for applicants, and December 2015 for evidence that a search for a COS had taken place and rationale for outcome choice in the absence of COS. A survey of applicants was conducted to further explore their use of COS and choice of outcomes with a response rate of 49%. Nine out of 95 applicants (10%) stated in their application that they had searched the COMET (Core Outcome Measures for Effectiveness Trials) Initiative database for a COS and another nine referred to searching for a COS using another method, e.g. a review of the literature. Of the 77 (81%) applicants that did not mention COMET or COS in their application, eight stated in the survey that they had searched the COMET database and ten carried out a search using another method. Some applicants who did not search for a COS gave reasons for their choice of outcomes including taking advice from patients and the public and choosing outcomes used in previous trials.
   Conclusion
   A funding body can have an impact on COS uptake by encouraging trialists to search for a COS. Funders could take further steps by putting processes in place to prompt applicants to be explicit about searching for COS in their application and notifying the funding board if a search has not taken place. The sources of information used by trialists to make decisions about outcomes in the absence of COS may suggest methods of dissemination for COS.

AB Chronic critical illness (CCI) is a relevant clinical, social and financial health issue. The aim of this study was to compare the mental outcomes (symptoms of anxiety and depression) and quality of life outcomes of the family members of patients with CCI from different socioeconomic backgrounds who were admitted to one of the intensive care units (ICUs) in two Brazilian hospitals, one private and one public. It is a prospective study involving a public hospital that serves a low-income population and a tertiary private hospital that serves a high-income population. Family members of patients with CCI answered the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and The World Health Organization Quality of Life-WHOQOL-bref questionnaires. They responded to the European Quality of life Five Dimension three Level (EuroQol-5D-3L) and the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) questionnaires on behalf of the patients at three time points: during the ICU stay, 30 and 90 days after the patient was discharged. We used logistic regression models to evaluate the main predictors of a binary outcome regarding symptoms of anxiety and depression. We enrolled 186 patients with CCI. Many patients from public hospitals who were independent became dependent for their ADLs at 90 days (41.7% versus 14.3%, p = 0.03). At 30 days, family members from public hospital had worse impact on all domains of WHOQOL-bref compared with families from private hospital. At 90-days, the difference persists in the physical domain, worse for families from public hospital (p = 0.006). The symptoms of depression at 30-days (p = 0.008) and at 90-days (p = 0.013) were worse in the public hospital. CCIs affected quality of life and the emotional condition of family members, especially in families with fewer resources when the patients became more dependent. Family members with higher education were more likely to experience depression, while depression was associated with cohabiting with the patient in low-income families.

AB Background Scabies, a parasitic disease of the skin, is a major public health problem, largely affecting children. Scabies is often complicated by impetigo which can result in serious complications including invasive infections and immune mediated diseases. Scabies and impetigo are reported to have high prevalence in tropical settings including the Solomon Islands. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional prevalence survey at Gizo Primary School in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands in August 2018. The diagnosis of scabies was based on criteria developed by the International Alliance for the Control of Scabies in 2018. Population attributable risk was calculated to determine the effect of scabies on the prevalence of impetigo, and both adjusted and unadjusted risk ratios were calculated to identify differences between sexes and age groups. Results A total of 324 students were assessed (47.5% of those enrolled at the school). The prevalence of scabies was 54.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 48.7-59.8) and most disease was mild (68.8%). The prevalence was higher in males (63.5%; adjusted risk ratio [ARR] 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.7), and in those aged 10-12 years (61.4%; ARR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.9 when compared to those aged 4-6 years). The prevalence of impetigo was 32.1%, with males more likely to be affected (41.7%, ARR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.4) but with no significant differences between age groups. 63.5% of those with impetigo had scabies, corresponding to a population attributable risk of 11.8%. Conclusions There is a very high burden of scabies and impetigo among primary school students in Gizo. There is a critical need for the development and implementation of control programs in areas where scabies is endemic.

AB Background Ethical dilemmas are part of medicine, but the type of challenges, the frequency of their occurrence and the nuances in the difficulties have not been systematically studied in low-income settings. The objective of this paper was to map out the ethical dilemmas from the perspective of Ethiopian physicians working in public hospitals. Method A national survey of physicians from 49 public hospitals using stratified, multi-stage sampling was conducted in six of the 11 regions in Ethiopia. Descriptive statistics were used and the responses to the open-ended question "If you have experienced any ethical dilemma, can you please describe a dilemma you have encountered in your own words?" were analyzed using a template analysis process. Results A total of 587 physicians responded (response rate 91,7%), and 565 met the inclusion criteria. Twelve of 24 specified ethically challenging situations were reported to be experienced often or sometimes by more than 50% of the physicians. The most frequently reported challenge concerned resource distribution: 93% agreed that they often or sometimes had to make difficult choices due to resource limitation, and 83% often or sometimes encountered difficulties because patients were unable to pay for the preferred course of treatment. Other frequently reported difficulties were doubts about doing good or harming the patient, relating to conflicting views, concern for family welfare, disclosure issues and caring for patients not able to consent. Few reported dilemmas related to end-of-life issues. The 200 responses to the open-ended question mirrored the quantitative results. Discussion Ethiopian physicians report ethical challenges related more to bedside rationing and fairness concerns than futility discussions and conflicts about autonomy as described in studies from high-income countries. In addition to the high report of experienced challenges, gravity of the dilemmas that are present in their narratives are striking. Recognition of the everyday experiences of physicians in low-income settings should prompt the development of ethics teaching and support mechanisms, discussion of ethical guidelines as well as increase our focus on how to improve the grave resource scarcity they describe.

AB Background Globally, Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is rising, but it is a neglected health threat to mothers and their children in low resource countries. Although, GDM is known in Ethiopia, information regarding it remains scarce by recent diagnostic criteria. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of GDM and associated factors among women attending antenatal care at Gondar town public health facilities, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1027 pregnant women selected by the systematic random sampling technique. The universal one-step screening and diagnostic strategy was done using a two-hour 75 g oral glucose tolerance test. GDM was diagnosed using updated diagnostic criteria (2017 American Diabetes Association (ADA) or 2013 World Health Organization (WHO) or modified International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups diagnostic criteria (IADPSG)). Binary logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with GDM. Results Of the total 1027 pregnant women, 12.8% (95% CI: 10.8-14.8) were diagnosed with GDM. Overweight and/or obesity (MUAC >= 28 cm) (AOR = 2.25, 95% CI: 1.18-4.26), previous history of GDM (AOR = 5.82, 95% CI: 2.57-13.18), family history of diabetes (AOR = 4.03, 95% CI: 1.57-10.35), low physical activity (AOR = 3.36, 95% CI: 1.60-7.04), inadequate dietary diversity (AOR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.02-3.53), and antenatal depression (AOR = 4.12, 95% CI: 1.85-9.20) were significantly associated with GDM. Conclusions The prevalence of GDM among women attending antenatal care at Gondar town public health facilities was high. Previous history of GDM, antenatal depression, family history of diabetes, low physical activity, overweight and/or obesity and inadequate dietary diversity were significantly associated with GDM. Routine screening of pregnant women and healthy lifestyle are strongly recommended.

AB Background The cholera outbreak in 2018 in Nigeria reaffirms its public health threat to the country. Evidence on the current epidemiology of cholera required for the design and implementation of appropriate interventions towards attaining the global roadmap strategic goals for cholera elimination however seems lacking. Thus, this study aimed at addressing this gap by describing the epidemiology of the 2018 cholera outbreak in Nigeria. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of surveillance data collected between January 1st and November 19th, 2018. A cholera case was defined as an individual aged 2 years or older presenting with acute watery diarrhoea and severe dehydration or dying from acute watery diarrhoea. Descriptive analyses were performed and presented with respect to person, time and place using appropriate statistics. Results There were 43,996 cholera cases and 836 cholera deaths across 20 states in Nigeria during the outbreak period, with an attack rate (AR) of 127.43/100,000 population and a case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.90%. Individuals aged 15 years or older (47.76%) were the most affected age group, but the proportion of affected males and females was about the same (49.00 and 51.00% respectively). The outbreak was characterised by four distinct epidemic waves, with higher number of deaths recorded in the third and fourth waves. States from the north-west and north-east regions of the country recorded the highest ARs while those from the north-central recorded the highest CFRs. Conclusion The severity and wide-geographical distribution of cholera cases and deaths during the 2018 outbreak are indicative of an elevated burden, which was more notable in the northern region of the country. Overall, the findings reaffirm the strategic role of a multi-sectoral approach in the design and implementation of public health interventions aimed at preventing and controlling cholera in Nigeria.

AB Background Insufficient physical activity (IPA) is one of the leading causes of premature mortality through the increased burden of non-communicable diseases. From 1990 to 2017, the percentage of low physical activity attributable disability-adjusted life years (DALY) increased globally by 1.5 times and 2-fold in Iran, causing more than 1.2 million deaths worldwide and 18,000 deaths in Iran in 2017. Reports suggest that Iran, a developing middle-income country, suffers from a high level of IPA. Socioeconomic and cultural alterations along with the country's developments expose the population to IPA risk. We aimed to describe IPA prevalence in Iran's adult population, categorized by demographics, geographical region, and activity domains to assess the present pattern of physical inactivity and its domains in the country. Methods In 2016, in order to represent Iran's adult population, adult participants (n: 30541) from 30 provinces were selected using systematic proportional to size cluster sampling. Physical activity (PA) was assessed via the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire, calculating the Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) value in minutes per week for work, recreation, and transport domains. Insufficient physical activity (IPA) was defined according to WHO's recommendation (less than 600 METs per week). Adjusted odds ratios of IPA associates for sociodemographic, lifestyle related variables, and metabolic risk factors were reported. Results A high prevalence of IPA was seen in the total population (54.7%, 95%CI: 54.0-55.3) with a considerable difference between the two genders (males: 45.3% (95%CI: 44.3-46.3); females: 61.9% (95%CI: 61.0-62.7)). Work-related activity was the domain with the greatest percentage of total PA, whereas, both genders lacked recreational activities. In our findings, being female, a housekeeper, younger and living in urban areas were significantly associated with higher levels of IPA. Moreover, insufficient fruit and vegetable consumption, lack of alcohol consumption, having a personal vehicle, and finally, having a medical history of diabetes were significantly associated with the presence of IPA in our population. Among the study population, 33.6% (95%CI: 33.0-34.2) had at least 4 h of sedentary behavior in a typical day. Conclusions Widespread IPA among the Iranian adult population is of major concern. In our findings, we observed a considerable gap in the prevalence and pattern of IPA between the two genders. Additionally, IPA was associated with living in urban areas, unhealthy lifestyle habits and a history of other metabolic risk factors. Thus, a prompt initiative for population-specific actions should be taken.

AB Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) remain a worldwide problem and a severe threat to public health. The purpose of this study was to compare Aptima (R) Assays (Hologic (R)) and the Allplex (TM) STI Essential Assay (Seegene (R)) for the simultaneous detection of Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis and Mycoplasma genitalium in clinical practice. The Aptima (R) assays (Hologic (R)) are based on a transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) method. The Allplex (TM) STI Essential assay (Seegene (R)) is based on a multiplex Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) method. A total of 622 clinical samples from different anatomical sites were tested using both methods. A total of 88 (14.1%) and 66 (10.6%) positive samples were found for any of the TMA assays used and for the RT-PCR assay, respectively. Aptima (R) assays showed a slightly higher rate of positive results for all pathogens except for T. vaginalis, the results of which were similar to those obtained with Allplex (TM). The most commonly detected pathogen was C. trachomatis (37 samples; 5.9% using TMA assays) and the anatomical site with the highest prevalence of microorganisms was a non-urogenital site, the pharynx (27 positive samples; 4.3%). Using the Aptima (R) assays as reference method, the comparison showed that the average specificity of multiplex RT-PCR was 100.0% for the four pathogens. However an average sensitivity of 74.5% was observed, showing 95.2% (CI95%; 93.6-96.9) of overall concordance (kappa = 0.80). In conclusion, the Aptima (R) assays show a higher sensitivity on a wide range of sample types compared to the Allplex (TM) assay.

TI Public expenditure on Non-Communicable Diseases & Injuries in India: A
   budget-based analysis
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   Resource allocation decisions for disease categories can be informed by proper estimates of the magnitude and distribution of total spending. In the backdrop of a high burden of NonCommunicable Diseases and Injuries (NCDI) in India, and a paucity of estimates on government spending on NCDI, this paper attempts to analyse public sector expenditure on NCDI spending in India.
   Methods
   Various recent budget documents of the Centre and States/Union Territories have been used to extract expenditure on NCDI. The aggregates thus arrived at have been analysed to estimate aggregate and state level per capita spending. State level spending have been compared against disease burden using DALYs. Patterns of spending on NCDI across states were also analysed together with state level poverty to observe possible patterns.
   Findings
   The total spending on NCDI by the government is low at less than 0.5% of GDP. NCDI spending is little more than one-fourth of total health spending of the country and most spending takes place at the state level (80%). The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare's share in Central spending on NCDI is around 65%, and currently it spends 20% of its total health spending on NCDI. The gap between spending and DALYs is the most for the economically vulnerable states. Also, the states with high poverty levels also have low per capita expenditure on NCDI
   Interpretation
   India does not depend on donor funding for health. It will have to step up domestic funding to address the increasing disease burden of NCDIs and to reduce the high out-of-pocket expenditure on NCDI. Policies on NCDI need to focus on UHC, service integration and personnel gaps.

TI Structural equation modeling for hypertension and type 2 diabetes based
   on multiple SNPs and multiple phenotypes
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; BLOOD-PRESSURE; MEDIATION
AB Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying genetic variants associated with complex diseases. However, association analyses between genotypes and phenotypes are not straightforward due to the complex relationships between genetic and environmental factors. Moreover, multiple correlated phenotypes further complicate such analyses. To resolve this complexity, we present an analysis using structural equation modeling (SEM). Unlike current methods that focus only on identifying direct associations between diseases and genetic variants such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), our method introduces the effects of intermediate phenotypes, which are related phenotypes distinct from the target, into the systematic genetic study of diseases. Moreover, we consider multiple diseases simultaneously in a single model. The procedure can be summarized in four steps: 1) selection of informative SNPs, 2) extraction of latent variables from the selected SNPs, 3) investigation of the relationships among intermediate phenotypes and diseases, and 4) construction of an SEM. As a result, a quantitative map can be drawn that simultaneously shows the relationship among multiple SNPs, phenotypes, and diseases. In this study, we considered two correlated diseases, hypertension and type 2 diabetes (T2D), which are known to have a substantial overlap in their disease mechanism and have significant public health implications. As intermediate phenotypes for these diseases, we considered three obesity-related phenotypes-subscapular skin fold thickness, body mass index, and waist circumference-as traits representing subcutaneous adiposity, overall adiposity, and abdominal adiposity, respectively. Using GWAS data collected from the Korea Association Resource (KARE) project, we applied the proposed SEM process. Among 327,872 SNPs, 24 informative SNPs were selected in the first step (p<1.0E-05). Ten latent variables were generated in step 2. After an exploratory analysis, we established a path diagram among phenotypes and diseases in step 3. Finally, in step 4, we produced a quantitative map with paths moving from specific SNPs to hypertension through intermediate phenotypes and T2D. The resulting model had high goodness-of-fit measures (chi(2) = 536.52, NFI = 0.997, CFI = 0.998, GFI = 0.995, AGFI = 0.993, RMSEA = 0.012).

AB Background: Harmful use of alcohol is a global public health problem. Differences in alcohol consumption patterns may add valuable information to the design of public health interventions to prevent excessive use of alcohol, which is yet missing in Nepal. Hence, the purpose of the study is to determine the prevalence, patterns of alcohol consumption and socio-economic correlates of lifetime alcohol consumption and binge drinking in the semi-urban area of Pokhara Municipality.
   Methods: The cross-sectional data used in this study were collected as part of the COBIN study to understand alcohol consumption patterns and frequency and to determine correlates of lifetime alcohol consumption and binge drinking in the semi-urban area of Pokhara Municipality, Nepal.
   Results: Out of 2815 study participants, 35.6% had ever used alcohol in their lifetime (Male 67.2% and Female 18.9%). Among 571 respondents who drank alcohol within the past 30 days, 77.1% male, and 46.9% female reported binge drinking behaviour. On average, males consumed 8.8 +/- 0.3 standard alcohol drinks on one occasion, while females consumed only 4.4 +/- 0.3 alcoholic drinks. Male (OR = 16; 95% CI: 12.1-21.1), older adults (OR = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.2-1.7) and people belonging to disadvantaged ethnic group (OR = 6.1; 95% CI: 4.9-6.3) had higher odds of lifetime alcohol consumption than their respective counterparts. Whereas, male (OR = 7.9; 95% CI: 4.3-14.6), having higher educational status and agriculture as the occupation had higher odds of binge drinking.
   Conclusion: Alcohol consumption frequency was significantly higher among males than females in Western Nepal. Although national program and policies should recommend reducing alcohol consumption in general, targeted interventions are needed for males aged 45-65 years of age and certain ethnic groups (Dalit and Janajati).

DE Solid waste management; Asella; Ethiopia
AB BackgroundImproper solid waste management (SWM) is a major public health and environmental concern in the urban areas of many developing countries such as Asella Town. The aim of this study was to assess the status of SWM in Asella town.MethodsA community-based cross-sectional study design was used to assess the status of improper SWM and associated factors in Asella town. From the total of eight kebeles (smallest administrative unit in Ethiopia) four kebeles were randomly selected using lottery method. The sample size was 413 households. The households were proportionally allocated to each randomly selected kebeles. The data was collected by pretested questionnaire in the local language. Data was entered using statistical software Epi Info version seven and transferred to SPSS version 21. Descriptive data analysis was done to summarize the socioeconomic status of the respondents. Chi-square was used to show the association between the status of solid waste management and different variables. Binary logistic regression was used to determine the potential factors for improper SWM.Result332 (82.8%), had improper solid waste management practice. Lack of adequate knowledge about solid waste management and not having access to door to door solid waste collection could have contributed to the reported improper solid waste practice. Participants who didn't have access to door to door solid waste collection service were about three times more likely to practice improper solid waste management when compared to those who had access (AOR=2.873, 95 CI (1.565,5.273) P=0.001).ConclusionThe study finding showed that, the majority of the residents practiced improper solid waste management. Lack of adequate knowledge about solid waste management and not having access to door to door solid waste collection could have contributed to the reported improper solid waste practice. Therefore, there is a need to enhance the awareness of the community about proper SWM and to improve the door to door solid waste collection service by the town municipality.

AB BackgroundLower health literacy (HL) has been known to be involved in a range of common mental and physical disorders among adolescent students. Ample studies indicated low HL is associated with a series of chronic diseases even psychological diseases, nevertheless, little is known about this relationship among adolescents. In this context, the study aimed to examine associations between psychosomatic symptoms (physical and psychological symptoms) and HL in junior and senior high school students in China, and to provide guidance for improving the physical and mental health in Chinese adolescents.MethodsA total of 22,628 junior and high school students in China were enrolled in this study. HL and psychosomatic symptoms were measured by self-report validated questionnaires. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to examine the associations between six sub-scales of HL and physical / psychological symptoms.ResultsMultiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that the sub-scales of HL showed a significantly negative association with physical symptoms and psychological symptoms (P<0.05 for each). Physical symptoms was most strongly associated with IR (beta=-0.134), followed by SM (beta=-0.093), DB (beta=-0.059), SA (beta=-0.058) and PA (beta=-0.054). No statistically significant difference was found between HA and physical symptoms (P>0.05). Meanwhile, psychological symptoms were most strongly associated with IR (beta=-0.160), followed by SA (beta=-0.129), SM (beta=-0.069), DB (beta=-0.031), HA (beta=-0.026) and PA (beta=-0.021).ConclusionThese results indicated the importance of identifying the association of HL with physical and psychological symptoms, and provided the evidence that lower HL may serve as a critical and independent risk factor for poor health outcomes. Meanwhile, to maintain students' desirable healthy status public health efforts for enhancing their HL level are urgently needed in adolescents.

AB Background
   Frailty is a major health issue which impacts the life of older people, posing a significant challenge to the health system. One of the key emerging areas is the development of frailty interventions to halt or reverse the progression of the condition. In many countries, economic evidence is required to inform public funding decisions for such interventions, and cost-effectiveness models are needed to estimate long-term costs and effects. Such models should capture current clinical understanding of frailty, its progression and its health consequences. The objective of this paper is to present a conceptual model of frailty that can be used to inform the development of a cost-effectiveness model to evaluate frailty interventions.
   Methods
   After critical analysis of the clinical and economic literature, a Delphi study consisting of experts from the disciplines of clinical medicine and epidemiology was undertaken to inform the key components of the conceptual model. We also identified relevant databases that can be used to populate and validate the model.
   Results
   A list of significant health states/events for which frailty is a strong independent risk factor was identified (e.g., hip fracture, hospital admission, delirium, death). We also identified a list of important patient attributes that may influence disease progression (e.g., age, gender, previous hospital admissions, depression). A number of large-scale relevant databases were also identified to populate and validate the cost-effectiveness model. Face validity of model structure was confirmed by experts.
   Discussion and conclusions
   The proposed conceptual model is being used as a basis for developing a new cost-effectiveness model to estimate lifetime costs and outcomes associated with a range of frailty interventions. Using an appropriate model structure, which more accurately reflects the natural history of frailty, will improve model transparency and accuracy. This will ultimately lead to better informed public funding decisions around interventions to manage frailty.

TI Target women: Equity in access to mHealth technology in a
   non-communicable disease care intervention in Kenya
SO PLOS ONE

   MANAGEMENT; BURDEN
AB Background
   Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) constitute 40 million deaths annually. Eighty-percent of these deaths occur in Low- and Middle-Income Countries. MHealth provides a potentially highly effective modality for global public health, however access is poorly understood. The objective of our study was to assess equity in access to mHealth in an NCD intervention in Kenya.
   Methods
   This is a secondary analysis of a complex NCD intervention targeting slum residents in Kenya. The primary outcomes were: willingness to receive SMS, whether SMS was received, and access to SMS compared to alternative health information modalities. Age, sex, level of education, level of income, type of work, number of hours worked, and home environment were explanatory variables considered. Multivariable regression analyses were used to test for association using likelihood ratio testing.
   Results
   7,618 individual participants were included in the analysis. The median age was 44 years old. Majority (75%, n = 3,691/4,927) had only attended up to primary (elementary) school. Majority reported earning "KShs 7,500 or greater" (27%, n = 1,276/4,736). Age and level of income had evidence of association with willingness to receive SMS, and age, sex and number of hours work with whether SMS was received. SMS was the health information modality with highest odds of being accessed in older age groups (OR 4.70, 8.72 and 28.89, for age brackets 60-69, 70-79 and 80 years or older, respectively), among women (OR = 1.86, 95% CI 1.19-2.89), and second only to Baraazas (community gatherings) among those with lowest income.
   Conclusion
   Women had the greatest likelihood of receiving SMS. SMS performed equitably well amongst marginalized populations (elderly, women, and low-income) as compared to alternative health information modalities, though sensitization prior to implementation of mHealth interventions may be needed. These findings provide guidance for developing mHealth interventions targeting marginalized populations in these settings.

TI Projecting burden of hypertension and its management in Turkey,
   2015-2030
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID BLOOD-PRESSURE; SODIUM-INTAKE; SALT INTAKE; PREVENTION; REDUCTION;
   AWARENESS; COSTS
AB Background
   In Turkey, hypertension was responsible for 13% of total deaths in 2015. We apply existing research finding regarding the impact of a population-wide reduction in sodium consumption on the decrease of the hypertension prevalence rate among 15+ years population and the gender-age specific reduction in total death rates among 30+ years population, and compare hypertension burden, averted deaths, costs and benefits between two scenarios.
   Methods
   The first scenario (i.e. status quo) assumes constant hypertension prevalence rate and the death rates between 2015 and 2030. Based on the Framingham Heart Study and INTER-SALT Study findings on the impact of salt-reduction strategies on hypertension prevalence rate, the second scenario (Scenario II) assumes a 17% reduction in the prevalence of hypertension in Turkey in 2030, from its 2015 prevalence level. We project hypertension attributable disability adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2030, monetize DALYs using GDP (and income) per capita, and compare the projected economic benefits of DALYs averted and the additional costs associated with the increases in hypertension treatment through antihypertensive medications and physician consultations.
   Results
   The estimated benefits of reducing the economic burden of hypertension deaths outweigh the cost of providing hypertension treatment. A decrease in hypertension prevalence by 17%, attributable to population-wide reduction in salt consumption, is projected to avert 24.3 thousand deaths in 2030. We projected that, compared to status quo, 392 thousand DALYs will be averted in Scenario II in 2030. The economic benefits of reduction in potential hypertension deaths are estimated to be 6.7 to 8.6 folds higher than the additional cost of hypertension treatment.
   Conclusion
   Population-wide hypertension prevention and management is a win-win situation for public health and the Turkish health care system as the economic benefits of reducing deaths and disabilities associated with hypertension outweigh the costs significantly.

ID NURSE ABSENTEEISM
AB Background Healthcare worker absenteeism is common in resource limited settings and contributes to poor quality of care in maternal and child health service delivery. There is a dearth of qualitative information on the scope, contributing factors, and impact of absenteeism in Kenyan healthcare facilities. Methods In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted between July 2015 and June 2016 with 20 healthcare providers in public and private healthcare facilities in Central and Western Kenya. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded, and analyzed using an iterative thematic approach. Results Half of providers reported that absenteeism occurs in both private and public health facilities. Absenteeism was most commonly characterized by providers arriving late or leaving early during scheduled work hours. The practice was attributed to institutional issues including: infrequent supervision, lack of professional consequences, limited accountability, and low wages. In some cases, healthcare workers were frequently absent because they held multiple positions at different health facilities. Provider absences result in increased patient wait times and may deter patients from seeking healthcare in the future. Conclusion There is a significant need for policies and programs to reduce provider absenteeism in Kenya. Intervention approaches must be cognizant of the contributors to absenteeism which occur at the institutional level.

AB Background The number of new rickettsial species are rapidly increasing, and increasing numbers of Rickettsia raoultii (R. raoultii) infection cases have been detected in humans. However, neurological abnormalities caused by R. raoultii are rarely reported, especially in northwestern China. Case presentation A 36-year-old Kazakh shepherd with an attached tick on part temporalis, presented with right eyelid droop, lethargy, fever, headache, fever (38.0-41.0 degrees C) and erythematous rash. The examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed cerebrospinal pressure of 200 mm H2O, leukocyte count of 300.0 x 10(6)/L, adenosine deaminase of 2.15 U/L, and total protein concentration of 0.93 g/L. The diagnosis of R. raoultii infection was confirmed by six genetic markers, and semi-quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rickettsial antigen. The patient gradually recovered after treatment with doxycycline and ceftriaxone. R. raoultii DNA was found both in a tick detached from this patient and in 0.18% (2/1107) of blood samples collected from local shepherds. Conclusions This is the first reported case with neurological abnormalities caused by R. raoultii in northwestern China. It is vital to detect rickettsial agents both in blood and CSF for tick bite patients with neurological abnormalities. Public health workers and physicians should pay attention to neurological abnormalities caused by Rickettsia.

AB Background In Nepal, cases of Cholera occur annually either as sporadic or as outbreaks claiming the lives of many in rural areas. The present study is a laboratory based surveillance which aims to analyze the changing epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibility trend of V. cholerae strains isolated or referred to National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL) over a period of 11 years (2006-2016). Methods Specimens of fresh stool /rectal swab either received at sentinel sites or NPHL were processed following standard microbiological techniques. Suspected colonies on selective medium were identified using routine biochemical tests and confirmed by serotyping. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed following Kirby Baeur disc diffusion method. Results Of the 836 confirmed isolates, 87% (728/836) were V.cholerae O1 Ogawa,12% (103/836) were V.cholerae O1 Inaba and only 6 isolates were V.cholerae O1 Hikojima. In 2006 all the Vibrio isolates were of Inaba serotype, followed by all 3 serotypes during 2007.During 2008-2014 only Ogawa serotype was isolated while few cases of Inaba again surfaced in 2015. Resistance to ampicillin decreased from 93% in 2006 to 18% by 2010 and again raised to 100% by 2016.Cotrimoxazole resistance remained at constant range (77-100%).Nalidixic acid resistance was 100% since 2006.Ciprofloxacin and tetracycline resistance emerged in 2007, reached a peak during 2010-2012 and declined to 0 by 2016.Susceptibility to Furazolidone has re-emerged.63.6% of the isolates were Multi drug resistant. Conclusion With changing epidemiology and antibiogram of V.cholerae in Nepal, the present study reflects the importance of continuous monitoring, which could be used by policy makers and health professionals for better management of outbreaks. Decline in tetracycline and ciprofloxacin resistance along with emerging sensitivity to furazolidone shows that these drugs could make an effective comeback in future.

DE Assisted suicide; Attitudes; Epidemiology; Euthanasia; Medical decision

AB Background Although euthanasia and assisted suicide (EAS) in people with psychiatric disorders is relatively rare, the increasing incidence of EAS requests has given rise to public and political debate. This study aimed to explore support of the public and physicians for euthanasia and assisted suicide in people with psychiatric disorders and examine factors associated with acceptance and conceivability of performing EAS in these patients. Methods A survey was distributed amongst a random sample of Dutch 2641 citizens (response 75%) and 3000 physicians (response 52%). Acceptance and conceivability of performing EAS, demographics, health status and professional characteristics were measured. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. Results Of the general public 53% were of the opinion that people with psychiatric disorders should be eligible for EAS, 15% was opposed to this, and 32% remained neutral. Higher educational level, Dutch ethnicity, and higher urbanization level were associated with higher acceptability of EAS whilst a religious life stance and good health were associated with lower acceptability. The percentage of physicians who considered performing EAS in people with psychiatric disorders conceivable ranged between 20% amongst medical specialists and 47% amongst general practitioners. Having received EAS requests from psychiatric patients before was associated with considering performing EAS conceivable. Being female, religious, medical specialist, or psychiatrist were associated with lower conceivability. The majority (> 65%) of the psychiatrists were of the opinion that it is possible to establish whether a psychiatric patient's suffering is unbearable and without prospect and whether the request is well-considered. Conclusion The general public shows more support than opposition as to whether patients suffering from a psychiatric disorder should be eligible for EAS, even though one third of the respondents remained neutral. Physicians' support depends on their specialization; 39% of psychiatrists considered performing EAS in psychiatric patients conceivable. The relatively low conceivability is possibly explained by psychiatric patients often not meeting the eligibility criteria.

AB Background Automated Vehicles (AVs) are central to the new mobility paradigm that promises to transform transportation systems and cities across the globe. To date, much of the research on AVs has focused on technological advancements with little emphasis on how this emerging technology will impact population-level health. This scoping study examines the potential health impacts of AVs based on the existing literature. Methods Using Arksey and O'Malley's scoping protocol, we searched academic and 'grey' literature to anticipate the effects of AVs on human health. Results Our search captured 43 information sources that discussed a least one of the five thematic areas related to health. The bulk of the evidence is related to road safety (n = 37), followed by a relatively equal distribution between social equity (n = 24), environment (n = 22), lifestyle (n = 20), and built environment (n = 18) themes. There is general agreement that AVs will improve road safety overall, thus reducing injuries and fatalities from human errors in operating motorized vehicles. However, the relationships with air quality, physical activity, and stress, among other health factors may be more complex. The broader health implications of AVs will be dependent on how the technology is adopted in various transportation systems. Regulatory action will be a significant determinant of how AVs could affect health, as well as how AVs influence social and environmental determinants of health. Conclusion To support researchers and practitioners considering the health implications of AVs, we provide a conceptual map of the direct and indirect linkages between AV use and health outcomes. It is important that stakeholders, including public health agencies work to ensure that population health outcomes and equitable distribution of health impacts are priority considerations as regulators develop their response to AVs. We recommend that public health and transportation officials actively monitor trends in AV introduction and adoption, regulators focus on protecting human health and safety in AV implementation, and researchers work to expand the body of evidence surrounding AVs and population health.

AB Background One of the greatest effects of the financial crisis in Spain has been the enormous increase in the number of evictions. Several studies have shown the association of evictions with different aspects of the physical and mental health. Furthermore, evictions have been associated with an increased risk of suicide. Our objective was to evaluate the risk of suicide among victims of eviction and investigate whether it is associated with specific characteristics of households and interviewees, the eviction process and social support, and health needs. Methods A total of 205 participants from households threatened with eviction in Granada, Spain, and 673 being the total number of members of these households, were interviewed in one-on-one sessions between April 2013 and May 2014. Through a questionnaire, information was obtained on physical and mental health, characteristics of their eviction process and support networks, and the use of health services. Results Almost half of the sample (46.7%) were at low (11.8%), moderate (16.9%), or high suicide risk (17.9%). Household and interviewee features had a limited association with suicide risk. On the contrary, the risk of suicide is greater with a longer exposure to the eviction process. In addition, threatening phone calls from banks increased significantly the risk of suicide, especially among men. Suicide risk was also associated with low social support, especially among women. Interviewees at risk of suicide received more help from nongovernmental organizations than those who were not at risk. In interviewees at risk, the main unmet needs were emotional and psychological help, especially in men. A high percentage of those at risk of suicide declare having large unmeet health needs. Finally, there was a tendency among the evicted at risk of suicide to visit emergency room and primary care more often than those not at risk, especially among women. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that when banks adopt a threatening attitude, suicide risk increases among the evicted. As hypothesized, when the evicted felt socially supported, suicide risk decreased. Emotional help was the main mediator of suicide risk and the main unmet need, especially among men.

AB Background Antiangiogenic therapy has proved to be an important therapeutic tool for many retinal vascular diseases; however, its availability is limited in developing countries. This study sought to describe the bevacizumab vial sharing process and to evaluate the impact of this repackaging system on the costs incurred in a Brazilian public hospital. Method This retrospective study compared the number and costs of intravitreal antiangiogenic injections approved via court order in the first year of the study (2015) to the number and costs of the bevacizumab injections provided through the use of vial sharing in the second year of the study (2016). Vial sharing consists of the traditional process used to repackage bevacizumab; in this case, however, the drug samples used were the residual volume from the preparation of bevacizumab for oncology patients. The hospital adhered to the guidelines established by the Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA). Results In the first year of the study and using medication obtained through court orders, 550 intravitreal injections were performed in the ophthalmology ambulatory care center. Based on local pricing tables, the total cost of the medication was BRL$1,036,056.25 (USD$267,546.58), and the average cost of each application was BRL$1883.74 (USD$486.45). In the second year of the study, 1081 intravitreal applications were performed at the same hospital using doses obtained through bevacizumab vial sharing. The total cost was BRL$21,942.49 (USD$5663.30) and the per-unit cost was BRL$20.30, or USD$5.23 (a savings of 97.88%). Conclusion This study found that bevacizumab vial sharing led to a significant reduction in public health care costs associated with antiangiogenic treatment and increased the availability of the drug to public health care patients. These results can be extrapolated to other types of drugs and health care systems.

DE Rollover protection; Media advocacy; Implementation; Discourse analysis
ID RISK PERCEPTIONS; PUBLIC-HEALTH
AB Background Media advocacy plays an important role in public health initiatives, as it can provide vital information to target populations, policy makers, or other relevant stakeholders. Unfortunately, little is currently known about the use of media advocacy to promote occupational safety and health programs. This study explores media coverage related to the Rollover Protection Structure (ROPS) Rebate Programs, which were designed to encourage the use of rollover protection on agricultural tractors, thus reducing the risk of tractor overturn fatalities. The Program's portrayal in the media, as well as the role that the media has played in implementing and sustaining these Programs. Methods Media articles pertaining to any of the state-based or National ROPS Rebate Programs and published between November 1, 2006 and October 31, 2018 were included for review. Discourse analysis was used to understand the messages portrayed by the media and how those messages shaped the outcomes of the ROPS Rebate Programs. Results During the study period, 212 unique articles were published about the ROPS Rebate Programs. While these articles all portrayed the ROPS Rebate Programs in a largely positive light, they were used at different stages, from pre-implementation through sustainment of the ROPS Rebate Programs, and to different extents. Conclusions Media articles have played an important role in implementing and sustaining the ROPS Rebate Programs. Based on the results of this study, more robust and continuous media coverage are important for the longevity and success of public health programs.

TI Graphical comparisons of relative disease burden across multiple risk
   factors
SO BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID POPULATION ATTRIBUTABLE FRACTION; DEFINITION; STROKE
AB Background Population attributable fractions (PAF) measure the proportion of disease prevalence that would be avoided in a hypothetical population, similar to the population of interest, but where a particular risk factor is eliminated. They are extensively used in epidemiology to quantify and compare disease burden due to various risk factors, and directly influence public policy regarding possible health interventions. In contrast to individual specific metrics such as relative risks and odds ratios, attributable fractions depend jointly on both risk factor prevalence and relative risk. The relative contributions of these two components is important, and usually needs to be presented in summary tables that are presented together with the attributable fraction calculation. However, representing PAF in an accessible graphical format, that captures both prevalence and relative risk, may assist interpretation. Methods Taylor-series approximations to PAF in terms of risk factor prevalence and log-odds ratio are derived that facilitate simultaneous representation of PAF, risk factor prevalence and risk-factor/disease log-odds ratios on a single co-ordinate axis. Methods are developed for binary, multi-category and continuous exposure variables. Results The methods are demonstrated using INTERSTROKE, a large international case control dataset focused on risk factors for stroke. Conclusions The described methods could be used as a complement to tables summarizing prevalence, odds ratios and PAF, and may convey the same information in a more intuitive and visually appealing manner. The suggested nomogram can also be used to visually estimate the effects of health interventions which only partially reduce risk factor prevalence. Finally, in the binary risk factor case, the approximations can also be used to quickly convert logistic regression coefficients for a risk factor into approximate PAFs.

AB Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disease with a group of metabolic derangements and inflammatory reactants in the serum. Despite the substantial public health implications, markers of diabetes progression with abdominal obesity are still needed to facilitate early detection and treatment. In this study, we performed a proteomic approach to identify differential target proteins underlying diabetes progression in patients with abdominal obesity. Proteomic differences were investigated in the serum of controls and patients with prediabetes or diabetes with or without abdominal obesity by 2-DE combined with MALDI-TOF-MS. Proteomics data were validated by western blot analyses and major protein-protein interactions were assessed using a network analysis with String database. Among 245 matched protein spots, 36 exhibited marked differences in normal patients with abdominal obesity, prediabetes, and diabetes compared to levels in normal patients without abdominal obesity. Seven (Alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, Alpha-1-antitrypsin, Apolipoprotein A-I, haptoglobin, retinol-binding protein 4, transthyretin, and zinc-alpha2-glycoprotein) of these spots exhibited significant differences between normal and prediabetes/diabetes patients. After a network analysis, functional annotation using Gene Ontology indicated that most of the identified proteins were involved in lipid transport, lipid localization, and the regulation of serum lipo-protein particle levels. Our results indicated that variation in the levels of these identified protein biomarkers has been reported in normal, prediabetes and diabetic Assessment of the levels of these biomarkers may contribute to the development of biomarkers for not only early diagnosis but also in prognosis of diabetes mellitus type 2.

TI The health and cost burden of antibiotic resistant and susceptible
   Escherichia coli bacteraemia in the English hospital setting: A national
   retrospective cohort study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID INFECTIONS; MORTALITY
AB Introduction
   Antibiotic resistance poses a threat to public health and healthcare systems. Escherichia coli causes more bacteraemia episodes in England than any other bacterial species. This study aimed to estimate the burden of E. coli bacteraemia and associated antibiotic resistance in the secondary care setting.
   Materials and methods
   This was a retrospective cohort study, with E. coli bacteraemia as the main exposure of interest. Adult hospital in-patients, admitted to acute NHS hospitals between July 2011 and June 2012 were included. English national surveillance and administrative datasets were utilised. Cox proportional hazard, subdistribution hazard and multistate models were constructed to estimate rate of discharge, rate of in-hospital death and excess length of stay, with a unit bed day cost applied to the latter to estimate cost burden from the healthcare system perspective.
   Results
   14,042 E. coli bacteraemia and 8,919,284 non-infected inpatient observations were included. E. coli bacteraemia was associated with an increased rate of in-hospital death across all models, with an adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio of 5.88 (95% CI: 5.62-6.15). Resistance was not found to be associated with in-hospital mortality once adjusting for patient and hospital covariates. However, resistance was found to be associated with an increased excess length of stay. This was especially true for third generation cephalosporin (1.58 days excess length of stay, 95% CI: 0.84-2.31) and piperacillin/tazobactam resistance (1.23 days (95% CI: 0.50-1.95)). The annual cost of E. coli bacteraemia was estimated to be 14,346,400 pound (2012 ) pound, with third-generation cephalosporin resistance associated with excess costs per infection of 420 pound (95% CI: 220-630).
   Conclusions
   E. coli bacteraemia places a statistically significant burden on patient health and the hospital sector in England. Resistance to front-line antibiotics increases length of stay; increasing the cost burden of such infections in the secondary care setting.

AB Background Personality Disorder (PD) is an enduring, multi-faceted mental disorder, associated with adverse health effects, difficulties with interpersonal relationships and in some cases increased risk to others. A limited number of dedicated forensic mental health services are available for serious offenders with severe personality disorder. The recent Offender Personality Disorder (OPD) strategy aims to ensure that most such offenders are treated in prison rather than secure psychiatric services, except in highly complex cases where this is not possible. While the strategy sets out very broad criteria relating to this, greater clarity is needed to support decisions about appropriate transfer and hence enhance public protection. This study explored which characteristics professional experts associate with appropriate transfer from prison to forensic mental health services for high-risk offenders with PD. Method A modified Delphi survey distributed through an online survey system was conducted in two-rounds with a group of professional experts recruited from forensic mental healthcare; criminal justice and specialist commissioning. Results Fifty-one (56%) respondents completed stage one of the Delphi and 34 (61%) of these completed stage two. Consensus was reached for a total of 22 items indicating complexity, including co-morbid mental illness, high level of risk, lack of progress in prison and high motivation for treatment. A preliminary checklist for these factors was developed. Panel members consistently emphasised the importance of the individual's presenting need, the overall clinical picture and formulation in their free text responses. Conclusions Professionals face a complex picture when making decisions regarding suitability for hospital admission for high-risk male offenders with PD, with varied opinions amongst professional experts as to priorities for intervention and a focus on individual needs through formulation. It was, nevertheless, possible to condense these views into a set of consistent variables that can be used to highlight the need for transfer into hospital-based treatment services.

AB Background: Maternal mental health is an international public health concern. Many women experience mental ill-health during and after pregnancy, but assessment is not part of routine maternity care in many low- and middle-income countries. Healthcare providers are in a position to identify and support women who experience mental health disorders during and after pregnancy. We sought to investigate the knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of routine screening for maternal mental health during and after pregnancy among healthcare providers providing routine maternity care in Accra, Ghana. Enabling factors, barriers and potential management options to routinely screen maternal mental health during and after pregnancy were explored.
   Methods: Semi-structured key informant interviews (n = 20) and one focus group discussion (n = 4) were conducted with healthcare providers working in one public hospital in Accra, Ghana. Transcribed interviews were coded by topic and then grouped into categories. Thematic framework analysis was undertaken to identify emerging themes.
   Results: Most healthcare providers are aware of the importance of maternal mental health and would be keen to help women who experience mental ill-health during and after pregnancy, if resources were available to do so. An enabling factor was the suggestion of introducing a culturally appropriate mental health screening tool. However, compromised mental health was often considered a 'spiritual issue' and not routinely screened for by healthcare providers, nor requested by women. Barriers to the provision of quality maternal mental health care included lack of trained staff and lack of time.
   Conclusions: Healthcare providers are aware of the problem of the lack of maternal mental health provision during and after pregnancy and are open to developing protocols to improve care. Currently, screening for maternal mental ill-health is not part of routine maternity care. The establishment of such a service requires the reprioritisation of workloads, further training, and a change in the attitudes and practices of healthcare providers. Education to change the attitudes of healthcare providers, women and the wider community towards mental health is needed. The development and implementation of culturally appropriate guidelines would be beneficial and result in better quality of maternity care.

AB In July 2011, renovations to Yale-New Haven Hospital inadvertently exposed the cemetery of Christ Church, New Haven, Connecticut's first Catholic cemetery. While this cemetery was active between 1833 and 1851, both the church and its cemetery disappeared from public records, making the discovery serendipitous. Four relatively well-preserved adult skeletons were recovered with few artifacts. All four individuals show indicators of manual labor, health and disease stressors, and dental health issues. Two show indicators of trauma, with the possibility of judicial hanging in one individual. Musculoskeletal markings are consistent with physical stress, and two individuals have arthritic indicators of repetitive movement/specialized activities. Radiographic analyses show osteopenia, healed trauma, and other pathologies in several individuals. Dental calculus analysis did not identify any tuberculosis indicators, despite osteological markers. Isotopic analyses of teeth indicate that all four were likely recent immigrants to the Northeastern United States. Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA were recovered from three individuals, and these analyses identified ancestry, hair/eye color, and relatedness. Genetic and isotopic results upended our initial ancestry assessment based on burial context alone. These individuals provide biocultural evidence of New Haven's Industrial Revolution and the plasticity of ethnic and religious identity in the immigrant experience. Their recovery and the multifaceted analyses described here illuminate a previously undescribed part of the city's rich history. The collective expertise of biological, geochemical, archaeological, and historical researchers interprets socioeconomic and cultural identity better than any one could alone. Our combined efforts changed our initial assumptions of a poor urban Catholic cemetery's membership, and provide a template for future discoveries and analyses.

TI Reasons behind stymied public hospital governance reform in China
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   The public hospital governance reform in China is pledged to improve the governance of public hospitals and deliver affordable and high-quality care. However, progress in public hospital reform has been slow. The reason is poorly understood.
   Methods
   A research center affiliated with China National Health Commission has conducted 32 workshops to interview 124 public hospital administrators from 30 provincial-level administrative divisions and 105 various-level government officials from three provinces. About 80% of administrators and 78% officials actively participated the discussions. We used a descriptive theoretical approach to understand the relationships between the governance reform and characteristics of its stakeholders. We also analyzed stakeholder interests and their power to influence the reform.
   Findings
   About 66% of hospital administrators, 72% of health officials, and less than 10% of other officials support a new hospital governing structure. Local leadership, hospital administrators, and health commission said that administrators should have more power over the management of public hospitals. Other government departments and healthcare professionals had reservations on the governance reform. The reform of public hospital governance faces significant obstacles. The interests of most government stakeholders are not aligned with public interests. All stakeholders perceived that their workload would increase in the short term because of the governance reform of public hospitals. Most people involved in the reform are not incentivized to collaborate. The health commission has limited financial resources and insufficient political power to implement a massive reform. Most importantly, the public hospital reform is not, and likely will not be, a top policy priority to the central government or local leaderships.
   Interpretation
   The health commission needs more political support and resources to speed up the public hospital reform. To fulfill the pledge of affordable, equitable access to quality care, Chinese government needs to overcome significant obstacles in the public hospital reform.

AB Background Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus multilocularis (E. multilocularis), and considered as public health issue. Parasite-host immune interaction is pivotal during infection. As a subset of innate lymphoid cells, NK cells are known to play an important role during virus, bacteria, intra/extracellular parasitic infections and tumor progression. However, the possible role of NK cells in E. multilocularis infection in both human and murine is little known. Herein, the functional alteration of hepatic NK cells and their related molecules in E. multilocularis infected mice were studied. Methods 2000 protoscoleces (PSCs) were injected to C57BL/6 mice via the portal vein to establish secondary E. multilocularis infection. NK cells population and their related molecules (CD69, Ly49D, Ly49G2, Ly49H, Ly49I, NKG2A, NKG2D, granzyme B, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) were assessed by using fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) techniques and qRT-PCR. NK cell depletion was performed for further understanding the possible function of NK cells during infection. Results The total frequencies of NK cells and NK-derived IFN-gamma production were significantly reduced at designated time points (2, 4, 12 weeks). The liver resident (CD49a(+)DX5(-)) NK cells are decreased at 4 weeks after inoculation and which is significantly lower than in control mice. Moreover, in vivo antibody-mediated NK cell depletion increased parasitic load and decreased peri-parasitic fibrosis. Expression of the inhibitory receptor NKG2A was negatively related to NK- derived IFN-gamma secretion. Conclusions Our study showed down regulates of NK cells and upper regulates of NKG2A expression on NK cells during E. multilocularis infection. Reduction of NK cell frequencies and increased NKG2A might result in low cytotoxic activity through decreased IFN-gamma secretion in E. multilocularis infection. This result might be helpful to restore NK cell related immunity against E. multilocularis infection to treat alveolar echinococcosis.

AB Background Physical activity (PA) can be a mechanism that develops emotions. Emotional intelligence (EI) is related to significant public health and psychological benefits. However, there is little information about the relationships between PA and EI dimensions: emotional attention, clarity, and repair. This study examined the possible relationships between these variables in undergraduate students from Madrid. As a secondary aim, sex differences in PA domains and EI dimensions were examined. Methods A total of 2960 (21.34 +/- 4.34 years) undergraduate students from Madrid (Spain) fulfilled the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS-24) and Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ). We used a MANOVA to compare EI and PA levels according to sex. Different linear regressions were conducted to calculate the PA and age prediction power based on EI. Results We found a significant association between EI dimensions and PA levels, although these relationships were small. Fully adjusted linear regression showed that sex and leisure-time PA (LTPA) were associated of emotional attention (r(c)(2) = .025). Sex, age, and LTPA were associated of emotional repair (r(c)(2) = .024). There were statistically significant differences in EI by sex (p <= .001; eta(2)(p =) .039), with higher scores in emotional attention for women (p <= .001) and emotional clarity (p <= .001) and repair (p <= .001) for men. PA levels differed according to sex (p <= .001; eta(2)(p =) .038). Men show higher scores in LTPA levels (p = .002) and occupational PA (p <= .001). Conclusions Undergraduate students with higher levels of LTPA showed a better score on EI, specifically in emotional attention and emotional repair. However, these associations and the predictive power of LTPA regarding emotional attention and emotional repair were weak. Men engaged in more LTPA and occupational PA and had higher emotional clarity and emotional repair than women. However, women had higher emotional attention.

TI A systematic review of the effectiveness of digital interventions for
   illicit substance misuse harm reduction in third-level students

AB Background Illicit substance misuse is a growing public health problem, with misuse peaking among 18-25 year-olds, and attendance at third-level education identified as a risk factor. Illicit substance misuse has the potential to harm mental and physical health, social relationships, and impact on academic achievements and future career prospects. Digital interventions have been identified as a vehicle for reaching large student populations and circumventing the limited capacity of student health services for delivering face-to-face interventions. Digital interventions have been developed in the area of alcohol and tobacco harm reduction, reporting some effectiveness, but the evidence for the effectiveness of digital interventions targeting illicit substance misuse is lacking. This review aims to systematically identify and critically appraise studies examining the effectiveness of digital interventions for illicit substance misuse harm reduction in third-level students. Methods We systematically searched ten databases in April 2018 using keywords and database specific terms under the pillars of "mHealth," "substance misuse," and "student." To be eligible for inclusion, papers had to present a measure of illicit substance misuse harm reduction. Included articles were critically appraised and included in the qualitative synthesis regardless of quality. Results A total of eight studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. Studies reported harm reduction in terms of substance misuse or initiation, as consequences or problems associated with substance misuse, or as correction of perceived social norms. Overall, five out of the eight studies reported at least one positive outcome for harm reduction. The critical appraisal indicated that the study quality was generally weak, predominantly due to a lack of blinding of study participants, and the use of self-reported substance misuse measures. However, results suggest that digital interventions may produce a modest reduction in harm from illicit substance misuse. Conclusions The results of this review are positive, and support the need for further high-quality research in this area, particularly given the success of digital interventions for alcohol and tobacco harm reduction. However, very few studies focused solely on illicit substances, and those that did targeted only marijuana. This suggests the need for further research on the effectiveness of this type of intervention for other illicit substances.

AB Background Making health-related decisions about loved ones with cognitive impairment may contribute to caregiver burden of care. We sought to explore factors associated with burden of care among informal caregivers who had made housing decisions on behalf of a cognitively impaired older person. Methods We conducted a secondary analysis within a cluster randomized trial (cRT) conducted in 16 publicly-funded home care service points across the Province of Quebec. The cRT assessed the impact of training home care teams in interprofessional shared decision making (IP-SDM). We assessed burden of care with the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) scale. We adapted Pallett's framework to inform our data analysis. This framework posits that factors influencing burden of care among caregivers fall within four domains: (a) characteristics of the caregiver, (b) characteristics of the cognitively impaired older person, (c) characteristics of the relationship between the caregiver and the cognitively impaired older person, and (d) the caregiver's perception of their social support resources. We computed the ZBI score and performed multilevel linear regression modelling. Results Among 296 caregivers included in the dataset, the mean ZBI score was 29.8 (SD = 17.5) out of 88. The typical participant was 62.6 years old (SD = 11.7), female (74.7%), and caring for a mother or father (61.2%). Using multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with caregiver burden mapped onto: caregiver characteristics (caregivers with higher burden were female, experienced higher decision regret and decisional conflict, preferred that their loved one move into the caregiver's home, into a private nursing home or a mixed private-public nursing home, and had made the decision more recently); relationship characteristics (spouses and children experienced higher burden); and caregiver's perception of social support resources (caregivers who perceived that a joint decision making process had occurred had higher burden). Conclusion In line with the proposed framework used, we found that caregiver characteristics, relationship characteristics and caregiver's perception of social support resources were associated with burden of care. Our results will help design interventions to prevent and/or reduce caregivers' burden of care.

AB Nymphaea tetragona Georgi (Nymphaceae) is traditionally used in Asia for the treatment of diarrhea, dysentery and fever. The plant contains various active compounds, including methyl gallate (MG) which are reported to inhibit bacterial virulence mechanisms. This study aimed to evaluate the alterations on viability, membrane potential and integrity of Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium exposed to MG in combination with Tylosin (Ty), which is relatively inactive against Gram-negative bacteria, but it is commonly used as a feed additive in livestock. Besides, the effects of sub-inhibitory concentrations of the combination (MT) on the interaction between S. Typhimurium and the host cell, as well as on the indirect host responses, were characterized. Flow cytometry, confocal and electron microscopic examinations were undertaken to determine the effects of MT on S. Typhimurium. The impacts of sub-inhibitory concentrations of MT on biofilm formation, as well as on the adhesion, invasion and intracellular survival of S. Typhimurium were assessed. The result demonstrated significant damage to the bacterial membrane, leakage of cell contents and a reduction in the membrane potential when treated with MT. Sub-inhibitory concentrations of MT significantly reduced (P < 0.05) the biofilm-forming, adhesive and invasive abilities of S. Typhimurium. Exposure to MT drastically reduced the bacterial count in macrophages. Up-regulation of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and IL-10 cytokine genes were detected in intestinal epithelial cells pre-treated with MT. This report is the first to describe the effects of MT against S. Typhimurium. The result indicates a synergistic interaction between MG and Ty against S. Typhimurium. Therefore, the combination may be a promising option to combat S. Typhimurium in swine and, indirectly, safeguard the health of the public.

TI Prevalence of afebrile malaria and development of risk-scores for
   gradation of villages: A study from a hot-spot in Odisha
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MATERNAL EDUCATION; POPULATION; INDIA
AB Introduction
   Malaria is a public health emergency in India and Odisha. The national malaria elimination programme aims to expedite early identification, treatment and follow-up of malaria cases in hot-spots through a robust health system, besides focusing on efficient vector control. This study, a result of mass screening conducted in a hot-spot in Odisha, aimed to assess prevalence, identify and estimate the risks and develop a management tool for malaria elimination.
   Methods
   Through a cross-sectional study and using WHO recommended Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT), 13221 individuals were screened. Information about age, gender, education and health practices were collected along with blood sample (5 mu l) for malaria testing. Altitude, forestation, availability of a village health worker and distance from secondary health center were captured using panel technique. A multi-level poisson regression model was used to analyze association between risk factors and prevalence of malaria, and to estimate risk scores.
   Results
   The prevalence of malaria was 5.8% and afebrile malaria accounted for 79 percent of all confirmed cases. Higher proportion of Pv infections were afebrile (81%). We found the prevalence to be 1.38 (1.1664-1.6457) times higher in villages where the Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) didn't stay; the risk increased by 1.38 (1.0428-1.8272) and 1.92 (1.4428-2.5764) times in mid- and high-altitude tertiles. With regard to forest coverage, villages falling under mid- and highest-tertiles were 2.01 times (1.6194-2.5129) and 2.03 times (1.5477-2.6809), respectively, more likely affected by malaria. Similarly, villages of mid tertile and lowest tertile of education had 1.73 times (1.3392-2.2586) and 2.50 times (2.009-3.1244) higher prevalence of malaria.
   Conclusion
   Presence of ASHA worker in villages, altitude, forestation, and education emerged as principal predictors of malaria infection in the study area. An easy-to-use risk-scoring system for ranking villages based on these risk factors could facilitate resource prioritization for malaria elimination.

ID AGE; PROGNOSIS; SURVIVAL
AB Purpose
   Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women worldwide. Despite the fact that breast cancer is more frequent after fifty years of age, breast cancer among young women has recently drawn particular attention due to an increase in incidence in several western countries. With the exception of individuals with a high genetic risk, breast cancer occurring in younger women remains poorly understood. This project aims at investigating the patient, tumour and treatment characteristics as well as the long-term health outcomes of these women by evaluating numerous variables that were collected from their pathology and medical files, including the social environment, family history, fertility and pregnancy.
   Participants
   We constituted a population-based cohort from the Geneva Cancer Registry of 1586 patients with breast cancer who were aged less than 46 years at the time of diagnosis.
   Findings to date
   Breast cancer was diagnosed before the age of 35 years in 225 women (14.2%), between 35 and 39 years of age in 368 women (23.2%) and between 40 and 45 years of age in 993 women (62.6%). Most of the patients were diagnosed with luminal A or luminal B molecular subtypes (32.8 and 37.5%, respectively), stage I or II tumours (75.2%), and estrogen (74.8%) and progesterone (67.5%) positive receptors. During the study period, 16.7% of these women developed loco-regional recurrences and 25.4% developed distant metastases; the majority (66.3%) did not have a recurrence. Regarding mortality, 474 (29.9%) women died during the study period, 347 (73.2%) from breast cancer.
   Future plans
   The results of this study will help filling the knowledge gap about treatment of young breast cancer patients and having a child after breast cancer, and will provide clinicians and public health professionals' with additional information to improve quality of care and decrease the impact of breast cancer in young women.

AB Background To investigate the prevalence and factors associated with the prevalence of multidrug/rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis among suspected drug resistant tuberculosis patients in Botswana. Methods A retrospective review of medical records of suspected drug resistant tuberculosis patients receiving care at public health facilities in Botswana was conducted from January, 2013 and December, 2014. Patient characteristics and drug susceptibility data were abstracted from 2568 medical records on to a pre-tested checklist form. The prevalence of multidrug/rifampicin resistance was computed. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression was carried out to determine the factors associated with the prevalence of multidrug/rifampicin in the study population. Results Overall, multidrug/ rifampicin - resistance among suspected drug resistant tuberculosis patients in Botswana were found in 139 (5.4%) cases with 1.3% among new cases and 7.7% among previously treated tuberculosis patients. Being a previously treated tuberculosis patient and having a positive smear were found to be factors associated with the prevalence of multidrug/rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (p < 0.05). However, age, sex, living in urban area and HIV status were not associated with this disease (p > 0.05). Conclusion This study highlights a low burden of multidrug/rifampicin resistant tuberculosis among suspected drug resistant tuberculosis patients receiving care at public health facilities in Botswana. Strategies in controlling MDR/RR-TB should emphasize on effective implementation of Directly Observation Treatment - short course strategy, continuous surveillance of drug resistance cases, prevention of the development of new cases of MDR/RR-TB and to treat existing patients. Further interventions should focus on strengthening TB infection control activities.

AB Background Increasing rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) in England is a pressing public health concern. Interventions targeting MSM, including information provision that effectively promotes sexual health, are needed. To support such intervention development, it is necessary to understand acceptable ways of delivering sexual health information. We explored the acceptability and potential uses and impacts of delivering sexual health information to MSM through social media and geosocial networking apps or dating apps. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted in person or by telephone with 25 MSM resident in England recruited via dating apps and social media advertisements. Interviews explored sexual health information sources, perceptions and uses. Attitudes towards sexual health promotion through social media and dating apps were then discussed. The data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results Sexual health information delivery through social media and dating apps was considered acceptable. Receiving information when browsing social media was viewed positively by most, as people have time to absorb information. In contrast, concerns were expressed that sharing or commenting on social media sexual health information may lead to judgements and discrimination. While social media reaches a high proportion of the population, dating apps can easily target MSM. However, tensions exist between the ability to provide information at an opportune time through dating apps, when users are connecting with new sexual partners, with the potential to adversely affect the app user's experience. Hypothetical and actual uses and impacts of sexual health information ranged from no impact to reading information, sharing with peers, and increased awareness, to influencing healthcare-seeking, decision-making and risk-taking behaviours. Ensuring that information is engaging, positive in tone, not too clinical, focused on building social norms and delivered by trusted organisations were viewed as important for supporting its use. Conclusions Overall, these findings support the development of new interventions that use dating apps and social media for sexual health promotion.

TI Cost-effectiveness of a statewide public health intervention to reduce
   cardiovascular disease risk
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID PRIMARY PREVENTION; HEART-FAILURE; OUTCOMES; AMERICAN; EVENTS; STROKE;
   LIFE
AB Background The cost-effectiveness of community health worker (CHW)-based cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk-reduction interventions is not well established. Colorado Heart Healthy Solutions is a CHW-based intervention designed to reduce modifiable CVD risk factors. This program has previously demonstrated success, but the cost-effectiveness is unknown. CHW-based interventions are potentially attractive complements to healthcare delivery because laypersons implement the intervention at a lower cost relative to medical care and may be attractive in rural settings with limited clinical resources. Methods CHWs performed screenings and provided ongoing participant support within predominantly rural communities. A point-of-service software tool was used to generate 10-year Framingham CVD risk scores and assist CHWs to make medical referrals and provide ongoing individualized support for lifestyle changes. A sample of program participants returned for reassessment of risk factors. We calculated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and program costs using a Markov model. Transition probabilities were calculated using Framingham risk equations or derived from the literature using the observed mean reduction in 10-year CVD risk score over of 37- months follow-up. Program cost-effectiveness was calculated for both at-risk (abnormal baseline CVD risk factors) and overall program populations. Results The base-case scenario evaluating a 52-year-old male participant revealed an incremental cost savings of $3576 and a gain of 0.16 QALYs associated with the intervention. Cost savings were greater in at-risk populations. The economic dominance of the model was robust in multiple sensitivity analyses. Conclusions A community-based CVD intervention demonstrated to reduce CVD risk is cost-effective. This suggests that population-based public health programs may have the potential to complement primary care preventative services to improve health and reduce the burden of traditional medical care.

AB Background Emergency department (ED) presentations made by patients having cancer treatment are associated with worth outcomes. This study aimed to explore the socio-demographic and disease related characteristics associated with ED presentation, frequent ED presentations, and place of discharge for cancer patients receiving systemic cancer therapies in the ambulatory setting. Methods This was a single site, retrospective observational cohort design. Hospital data for patients treated in the Day Oncology Unit of a large public tertiary hospital in Melbourne, Australia between December 2014 and November 2017 were extracted from clinical databases and retrospectively matched to ED attendance records. Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Service Utilisation provided the conceptual framework for exploring associations between socio-demographic and disease characteristics and ED use. Results A total of 2638 individuals were treated in the Day Oncology Unit over the study dates. Of these, 1182 (45%) made an unplanned ED presentation within 28 days of receiving systemic cancer therapy. One hundred and twenty-two (12%) patients attended the ED on two or more occasions within 28 days; while 112 (10%) patients attended the ED four or more times (within 28 days of receiving systemic cancer therapy) within any given 12 month period. Being born outside of Australia was independently related to making an unplanned ED presentation within 28 days of receiving anti-cancer therapy (p < .01) as was being diagnosed with head and neck (p = .03), upper gastrointestinal (p < .001), colorectal (p < .001), lung (p < .001), skin (p < .001) or breast cancer (p = .01). Conclusions This study identified a subgroup of cancer patients for whom an ED presentation is more likely. Better understanding of socio-demographic and disease related characteristics associated with the risk of an ED presentation may help inform targeted follow up of patients, to mitigate potentially avoidable ED presentation and optimize outcomes of care.

AB Background Health care systems are continually being reformed, however care improvement and intervention effectiveness are often assumed, not measured. This paper aimed to review findings from published studies about the appropriateness of eye care delivery, using existing published evidence and/or experts' practice and to describe the methods used to measure appropriateness of eye care. Methods A systematic search was conducted using Medline, Embase and CINAHL (2006 to September 2016). Studies reporting the processes of eye care delivery against existing published evidence and/or experts' practice were selected. Data was extracted from published reports and the methodological quality using a modified critical appraisal tool. The primary outcomes were percentage of appropriateness of eye care delivery. This study was registered with PROSPERO, reference CRD42016049974. Results Fifty-seven studies were included. Most studies assessed glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy and the overall methodological quality for most studies was moderate. The ranges of appropriateness of care delivery were 2-100% for glaucoma, 0-100% for diabetic retinopathy and 0-100% for other miscellaneous conditions. Published studies assessed a single ocular condition, a sample from a single centre or a single domain of care, but no study has attempted to measure the overall appropriateness of eye care delivery. Conclusions These findings indicated a wide range of appropriateness of eye care delivery, for glaucoma and diabetic eye care. Future research would benefit from a comprehensive approach where appropriateness of eye care is measured across multiple conditions with a single methodology, to guide priorities within eye care delivery and monitor quality improvement initiatives.

AB Background Maternal and perinatal mortality is a major public health concern across the globe and more so in low and middle-income countries. In Kenya, more than 6000 maternal deaths, and 35,000 stillbirths occur each year. The Government of Kenya abolished user fee for maternity care under the Free Maternity Service policy, in June of 2013 in all public health facilities, a move to make maternity services accessible and affordable, and to reduce maternal and perinatal mortality. Method An observational retrospective study was carried out in 3 counties in Kenya. Six maternal health output indicators were observed monthly, 2 years pre and 2 years post- policy implementation. Data was collected from daily maternity registers in 90 public health facilities across the 3 counties all serving an estimated population of 3 million people. Interrupted Time Series Analysis (ITSA) with a single group was used to assess the effects of the policy. Standard linear regression using generalized least squares (gls) model, was used to run the results for each of the six variables of interest. Absolute and relative changes were calculated using the gls model coefficients. Results Significant sustained increase of 89, 97, and 98% was observed in the antenatal care visits, health facility deliveries, and live births respectively, after the policy implementation. An immediate and significant increase of 27% was also noted for those women who received Emergency Obstetric Care (EmONC) services in either the level 5, 4 and 3 health facilities. No significant changes were observed in the stillbirth rate and caesarean section rate following policy implementation. Conclusion After 2 years of implementing the Free Maternity Service policy in Kenya, immediate and sustained increase in the use of skilled care during pregnancy and childbirth was observed. The study suggest that hospital cost is a major expense incurred by most women and their families whilst seeking maternity care services and a barrier to maternity care utilization. Overall, Free Maternity Service policy, as a health financing strategy, has exhibited the potential of realizing the full beneficial effects of maternal morbidity and mortality reduction by increasing access to skilled care.

AB Background Suicide has profound effects on families and communities, but is a statistically rare event. Psychological autopsies using a case-control design allow researchers to examine risk factors for suicide, using a variety of sources to detail the psychological and social characteristics of decedents and to compare them to controls. The Suicide Support and Information System Case Control study (SSIS-ACE) aimed to compare psychosocial, psychiatric and work-related risk factors across three groups of subjects: suicide decedents, patients presenting to hospital with a high-risk self-harm episode, and general practice controls. Methods The study design includes two inter-related studies; one main case-control study: comparing suicide cases to general practice (GP) controls, and one comparative study: comparing suicide cases to patients presenting with high-risk self-harm. Consecutive cases of suicide and probable suicide are identified through coroners' registration of deaths in the defined region (Cork City and County, Ireland) and are frequency-matched for age group and gender with GP patient controls recruited from the same GP practice as the deceased. Data sources for suicide cases include coroners' records, interviews with health care professionals and proxy informants; data sources for GP controls and for high-risk self-harm controls include interviews with control, with proxy informants and with health care professionals. Interviews are semi-structured and consist of quantitative and qualitative parts. The quantitative parts include a range of validated questionnaires addressing psychiatric, psychosocial and occupational factors. The study adopts several methodological innovations, including accessing multiple data sources for suicide cases and controls simultaneously, recruiting proxy informants to examine consistency across sources. Conclusions The study allows for the investigation of consistency across different data sources and contributes to the methodological advancement of psychological autopsy research. The study will also inform clinical and public health practice. The comparison between suicide cases and controls will allow investigation of risk and protective factors for suicide more generally, while the comparison with high-risk self-harm patients will help to identify the factors associated specifically with a fatal outcome to a self-harm episode. A further enhancement is the particular focus on specific work-related risk factors for suicide.

AB Objectives
   Stigma toward people with mental health problems (MHP) in primary health care (PHC) settings is an important public health challenge. Research on stigma toward MHP is relatively scarce in Chile and Latin America, as are instruments to measure stigma that are validated for use there. The present study aims to validate the Opening Minds Scale for Health Care Professionals (OMS-HC) among staff and providers in public Chilean PHC clinics, and examine differences in stigma by sociodemographic characteristics.
   Methods
   803 participants from 34 PHC clinics answered a self-administered questionnaire. Confirmatory factor analysis was completed. Average 15-item OMS-HC scores were calculated, and means were compared via t-test or ANOVA to identify group differences. Correlations of OMS-HC scores with other commonly used stigma scores were calculated to evaluate construct validity.
   Results
   The 3-factor OMS-HC structure was confirmed in this population. The average OMS-HC (alpha= 0.69) score was 34.55 (theoretical range 15-75). Significantly lower (less stigmatizing) mean OMS-HC scores were found in those with additional training and/or personal experience with MHP.
   Conclusion
   The validated, Spanish version of OMS-HC can be of use to further research stigma toward MHP in Chile and Latin America, advancing awareness and inspiring interventions to reduce stigma in the future.

AB Background Masters-level education is a key pathway of professional development for healthcare practitioners. Whilst there is evidence that Masters-level education leads to career enhancement, it is unclear how the programme pedagogy contributes to this. The objective was to: (1) examine the programme pedagogies and context that supports learning, and (2) synthesise the outputs, outcomes and impact of Masters-level healthcare programmes. Methods A systematic review was conducted according to the Cochrane Collaboration handbook and is reported in line with PRISMA. Using pre-defined key terms and eligibility criteria, two reviewers independently searched Medline, ERIC, Web of Science, ProQuest, and CINAHL Plus databases from inception to 14th November 2016, reference lists of retrieved articles and selected websites. Data were extracted independently. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to assess methodological quality. A Weight of Evidence Framework enabled evaluation of the overall quality of evidence. Data were synthesised using thematic qualitative analysis. Results Thirty-five studies were included. All studies were retrospective, evaluated programmes in nursing (n = 19), physiotherapy (n = 6), general and family medicine (n = 4), public health (n = 3), dentistry (n = 1), interdisciplinary (n = 1), and occupational therapy (n = 1). Most studies were rated low in methodological quality, with an overall low to moderate weight of evidence for programmes' outcomes and impact. Pedagogies that promote social participation and knowledge co-construction, reflection, learner-centred approach, relevance and authenticity influenced outcomes and impact. Conclusion(s) Notwithstanding the low to moderate weight of evidence, the review identified multiple positive outcomes of Master-level education for healthcare practitioners. Whilst the pedagogies that contributed to such positive outcomes were examined in some studies, there is a need to further explore links between programme pedagogy, outputs, outcomes and impact. A cultural approach to evaluation may capture how M-level education drives changes.

AB Background Health research apps often do not focus on usability as a design priority. This is problematic when the population of interest is disproportionately underrepresented as users of mobile apps, especially observed with aging older adults (> = 75). Challenges with the adoption of health information technology (HIT) among this group are exacerbated by poor design and user interface/experience (UI/UX) choices. This protocol describes the testing and evaluation process of one HIT app for the family-based collaboration platform InfoSAGE. Methods We aim to recruit twenty subjects from both informal family-caregivers and aging older adults to examine the usability of the InfoSAGE mobile medication manager. Participants will be audio and visually recorded, in addition to the use of screen capture recordings, while 'thinking aloud' as they complete eight common use-case scenarios. Multiple independent reviewers will code video and audio recordings for thematic analysis and use problems will be evaluated. Success and failure of each scenario will be determined by completion of sub-events. Time-to-complete analysis will be used to ascertain the learning curve associated with the app. Discussion Frequently observed problem areas will be used as the basis of further evolution of the app, and will further inform generalized recommendations for the design of HIT apps for research and public use. This study aims to improve the model of development for dual user populations with dissimilar technological literacy to improve retention and use. Results of this study will form the foundation of a design framework for mobile health apps.

AB Introduction Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a global public health issue that affect more than 2 billion individuals worldwide. However evidence for optimal management of IDA is lacking. Methods To assess the diagnostic criteria and therapeutic modalities for pediatric IDA employed by physicians in a major public healthcare facility in Riyadh, a validated questionnaire including demographic data and patient case-scenarios related to diagnosis and treatment of IDA was employed. Robust regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with overall score of participants. Results Of the 166 physicians surveyed 147(88.6%) were included in the study. Wide variability was observed in IDA diagnosis and therapy practises. For nutritional IDA, only 15.6% recommended no other laboratory tests in addition to CBC. The majority preferred treatment with ferrous sulfate (77.6%) divided into two doses (57.1%), but the total daily elemental iron doses varied widely from 2 to 6 mg/kg. For intravenous iron, 42.9% recommended iron dextran, 32.7% iron sucrose, and 13.4% would continue oral iron. Of all assessed factors, median score was significantly highest in pediatric hematologists compared with pediatricians, family medicine specialists and GPs; p = 0.007, and those work in tertiary care compared with those in primary care; p = 0.043. However, in multivariate robust regression analysis, overall score was only significantly associated with professional qualification [pediatric hematologist beta = 13.71,95%CI 2.48-24.95, p = 0.017; pediatrician beta = 1.77,95%C (- 6.05-9.59, p = 0.66; family medicine beta = 2.66,95%CI-4.30-9.58, p = 0.45 compared with general practitioner]. Conclusion Wide variations exist among physicians in diagnosis and treatment of pediatric IDA. Intervention programs and national guidelines are urgently needed.

AB Background School absenteeism data have been collected daily by the public health unit in Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph, Ontario since 2008. To date, a threshold-based approach has been implemented to raise alerts for community-wide and within-school illness outbreaks. We investigate several statistical modelling approaches to using school absenteeism for influenza surveillance at the regional level, and compare their performances using two metrics. Methods Daily absenteeism percentages from elementary and secondary schools, and report dates for influenza cases, were obtained from Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health. Several absenteeism data aggregations were explored, including using the average across all schools or only using schools of one type. A 10% absence threshold, exponentially weighted moving average model, logistic regression with and without seasonality terms, day of week indicators, and random intercepts for school year, and generalized estimating equations were used as epidemic detection methods for seasonal influenza. In the regression models, absenteeism data with various lags were used as predictor variables, and missing values in the datasets used for parameter estimation were handled either by deletion or linear interpolation. The epidemic detection methods were compared using a false alarm rate (FAR) as well as a metric for alarm timeliness. Results All model-based epidemic detection methods were found to decrease the FAR when compared to the 10% absence threshold. Regression models outperformed the exponentially weighted moving average model and including seasonality terms and a random intercept for school year generally resulted in fewer false alarms. The best-performing model, a seasonal logistic regression model with random intercept for school year and a day of week indicator where parameters were estimated using absenteeism data that had missing values linearly interpolated, produced a FAR of 0.299, compared to the pre-existing threshold method which at best gave a FAR of 0.827. Conclusions School absenteeism can be a useful tool for alerting public health to upcoming influenza epidemics in Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph. Logistic regression with seasonality terms and a random intercept for school year was effective at maximizing true alarms while minimizing false alarms on historical data from this region.

AB Background The Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care released a set of national standards which became a mandatory part of accreditation in 2013. Standard 9 focuses on the identification and treatment of deteriorating patients. The objective of the study was to identify changes in the characteristics and perceptions of rapid response systems (RRS) since the implementation of Standard 9. Methods Cross-sectional study of Australian hospitals. Baseline data was obtained from a pre-implementation survey in 2010 (220 hospitals). A follow-up survey was distributed in 2015 to staff involved in implementing Standard 9 in public and private hospitals (276 responses) across Australia. Results Since 2010, the proportion of hospitals with formal RRS had increased from 66 to 85. Only 7% of sites had dedicated funding to operate the RRS. 83% of respondents reported that Standard 9 had improved the recognition of, and response to, deteriorating patients in their health service, with 51% believing it had improved awareness at the executive level and 50% believing it had changed hospital culture. Conclusions Implementing a national safety and quality standard for deteriorating patients can change processes to deliver safer care, while raising the profile of safety issues. Despite limited dedicated funding and staffing, respondents reported that Standard 9 had a positive impact on the care for deteriorating patients in their hospitals.

AB Background Faced with growing budget pressure, policymakers worldwide recognize the necessity of strategic disinvestment from ineffective, inefficient or harmful medical practices. However, disinvestment programs face substantial social, political and cultural challenges: mistrust, struggles for clinical autonomy or stakeholders' reluctance to engage in what can be perceived as 'rationing'. Academic literature says little about effective strategies to address these challenges. This paper provides insights on this matter. We analyzed the epistemic work of a group of policymakers at the National Health Care Institute on what was initially a disinvestment initiative within the context of the Dutch basic benefits package: the 'Appropriate Care' program. The Institute developed a strategy using national administrative data to identify and tackle low-value care covered from public funds as well as potential underuse, and achieve savings through improved organization of efficiency and quality in health care delivery. How did the Institute deal with the socio-political sensitivities associated with disinvestment by means of their epistemic work? Method We conducted ethnographic research into the National Health Care Institute's epistemic practices. Research entailed document analysis, non-participant observation, in-depth conversations, and interviews with key-informants. Results The Institute dealt with the socio-political sensitivities associated with disinvestment by democratizing the epistemic practices to identify low-value care, by warranting data analysis by clinical experts, by creating an epistemic safe space for health care professionals who were the object of research into low-value care, and by de-emphasizing the economization measure. Ultimately, this epistemic work facilitated a collaborative construction of problems relating to low-value care practices and their solutions. Conclusions This case shows that - apart from the right data and adequate expertise - disinvestment requires clinical leadership and political will on the part of stakeholders. Our analysis of the Institute's Appropriate Care program shows how the epistemic effort to identify low-value care became a co-construction between policymakers, care providers, patients and insurers of problems of 'waste' in Dutch social health insurance. This collective epistemic work gave cognitive, moral and political standing to the idea of 'waste' in public health expenditure.

AB Background South Africa has the highest HIV prevalence and supports the largest antiretroviral therapy (ART) programme globally. With the introduction of a test and treat policy, ensuring long term optimal adherence to ART (>= 95%) is essential for successful patient and public health outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess long-term ART adherence to inform best practices for chronic HIV care. Method Long-term ART adherence was retrospectively analysed over a median duration of 5 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 5.3-6.5) in patients initially enrolled in a randomised controlled trial assessing tuberculosis and HIV treatment integration and subsequently followed post-trial in an observational cohort study in Durban, South Africa. The association between baseline patient characteristics and adherence over time was estimated using generalized estimating equations (GEE). Adherence was assessed using pharmacy pill counts conducted at each study visit and compared to 6 monthly viral load measurements. A Kaplan Meier survival analysis was used to estimate time to treatment failure. The McNemar test (with exact p-values) was used to determine the effect of pill burden and concurrent ART and tuberculosis treatment on adherence. Results Of the 270 patients included in the analysis; 54.8% were female, median age was 34 years (IQR:29-40) and median time on ART was 70 months (IQR = 64-78). Mean adherence was >= 95% for each year on ART. Stable patients provided with an extended 3-month ART supply maintained adherence > 99%. At study end, 96 and 94% of patients were optimally adherent and virologically suppressed, respectively. Time since ART initiation, female gender and primary breadwinner status were significantly associated with >= 95% adherence to ART. The cumulative probability of treatment failure was 10.7% at 5 years after ART initiation. Concurrent ART and tuberculosis treatment, or switching to a second line ART regimen with higher pill burden, did not impair ART adherence. Conclusion Optimal long-term adherence with successful treatment outcomes are possible within a structured ART programme with close adherence monitoring. This adherence support approach is relevant to a resource limited setting adopting a test and treat strategy.

AB Background Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are emerging foodborne pathogens that are public health concern. Cattle have been identified as the major STEC reservoir. In the present study, we investigated the prevalence and characteristics of STEC strains in beef cattle from a commercial farm in Sichuan province, China. Results Among 120 beef cattle fecal samples, stx genes were positive in 90% of samples, as assessed using TaqMan real-time PCR, and 87 (72.5%) samples were confirmed to yield at least one STEC isolate by culture using four selective agars, MacConkey, CHROMagar (TM) ECC, modified Rainbow (R) Agar O157, and CHROMagar (TM) STEC, from which 31, 32, 91, and 73 STEC strains were recovered, respectively. A total of 126 STEC isolates were selected and further characterized. Seventeen different O:H serotypes were identified, all of which belonged to the non-O157 serotypes. One stx(1) subtype (stx(1a)) and three stx(2) subtypes (stx(2a), stx(2c), and stx(2d)) were present among these isolates. The intimin encoding gene eae, and other adherence-associated genes (iha, saa, and paa) were present in 37, 125, 74, and 30 STEC isolates, respectively. Twenty-three isolates carried the virulence gene subA, and only one harbored both cnf1 and cnf2 genes. Three plasmid-origin virulence genes (ehxA, espP, and katP) were present in 111, 111, and 7 isolates, respectively. The 126 STEC isolates were divided into 49 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns. Conclusions Our study showed that the joint use of the selective MacConkey and modified Rainbow (R) Agar O157 agars increased the recovery frequency of non-O157 STEC strains in animal feces, which could be applied to other samples and in regular STEC surveillance. Moreover, the results revealed high genetic diversity of non-O157 STEC strains in beef cattle, some of which might have the potential to cause human diseases.

AB An association between HIV infection and cervical cancer, a major public health issue world-wide, has been reported. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and the distribution of HPV genotypes in HIV-infected women living in French Antilles and Guiana and to determine HIV-related characteristics associated with HPV infection. This cross-sectional study included 439 HIV-infected women who were followed between January 2011 and May 2014. Variables related to HIV infections were collected, and cervical samples were analysed to determine HPV genotypes. The median age of the population was 46 years. Estimated prevalence of HPV and high-risk (HR)-HPV infection were 50.1% IC95 [45.4-54.7] and 42% IC95 [37.3-46.6], respectively. HR-HPV 16, 52, 53 or intermediate risk-HPV-68 were found in 25% to 30% of the HPV-infected patients. Gynaecological screening revealed abnormal cervical smear in 24% and 42% of HR-HPV-negative and HPV-positive women, respectively (p = 0.003). Approximately 90% of women were on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Demographic characteristics associated with a higher prevalence of HPV infection included alcohol consumption. Regarding HIV-related characteristics, current therapy on ART, its duration, and undetectable plasma concentrations of RNA-HIV1 were associated with a lower risk of HPV infection. Infection rate with HR-HPV was higher than what is commonly reported in HIV-negative women worldwide and was more likely in women with incomplete HIV suppression. These results highlight the need for supporting adherence to ART, cervical cytology, HPV testing and HPV vaccination.

   immunodeficiency virus infection in Bangladesh: A qualitative study

AB Background
   In Bangladesh, community-based and peer-led prevention interventions for human immunodeficiency virus infection are provided to key populations (KPs) by drop-in centers (DICs), which are primarily supported by external donors. This intervention approach was adopted because public healthcare facilities were reportedly insensitive to the needs and culture of KPs, particularly with regard to the provision of sexually transmitted infection (STI) services. Nonetheless, in the absence of external funding, STI services need to be integrated into public healthcare systems.
   Methods
   A qualitative study was conducted in 2017 to understand the willingness of KPs to uptake the STI services of public healthcare facilities. Data were collected based on 34 in-depth interviews, 11 focus group discussions, and 9 key informant interviews. The social-ecological theoretical framework was used to analyze the data thematically and contextually.
   Results
   Most participants were either resistant or reluctant to uptake STI services from public healthcare facilities because of their previous firsthand experiences (e.g., disrespectful and judgmental attitudes and behaviors), perceived discrimination, anticipatory fear, and a lack of privacy. Very few participants who had visited these facilities to receive STI services were motivated to revisit them. Nevertheless, they emphasized their comfort in DICs over public healthcare facilities. Thus, it appears that KPs can be situated along a care-seeking continuum (i.e., resistance to complete willingness). Unless policymakers understand the context and reasons that underlie their movement along this continuum, it would be difficult to encourage KPs to access STI services from public healthcare facilities.
   Conclusion
   KPs' willingness to uptake the STI services of public healthcare facilities depends not only on individual and community experiences but also on the nexus between socio-structural factors and health inequalities. Community mobilization and training about the needs and culture of KPs for healthcare professionals are essential. Therefore, addressal of a wide range of structural factors is required to motivate KPs into seeking STI services from public healthcare facilities.

This article aims to assess the overall prevalence of ESBLs among animals in India, with year-wise, zone-wise and species-wise stratification. Systematic search from PubMed, Google Scholar and J-Gate Plus was carried out and 24 eligible articles from 2013-2019 in India were retrieved. The R Open source Scripting software was used to perform statistical analysis. The overall prevalence of ESBLs among animals in India was 9%. The pooled prevalence of ESBLs in animals were 26, 11, 6 and 8% for north, east, south and central zones, respectively. The reported prevalence of ESBLs in animals were 12, 5, 8, 8, 12, 13 and 33% were reported for the years 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 respectively. The species-wise stratified results showed a predominance of ESBL producing Klebsiella pneumoniae strains (11%) when compared to Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas spp. which were 7% and 5%, respectively. The prevalence data generated could be utilized in infection control and in antibiotic use management decisions for developing appropriate intervention strategies.

ID PATIENT RETENTION
AB Background Loss to follow-up (LTFU) from care among people living with HIV (PLHIV) is thought to be more common in the public setting compared to the private health care. It is anticipated that the problem may become worse with the current "test and treat" policy in Uganda due to the likely increases in patient loads and its attendant pressure on health care providers to support patient counseling. This study determined the incidence and factors associated with LTFU from HIV care among adult PLHIV in public health facilities in Wakiso district, Uganda. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study that involved the review of 646 records of patients initiated on antiretroviral therapy (ART) between January 1st, 2015 and December 31st, 2017 at 13 randomly selected public health facilities in Wakiso district. The cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine the factors associated with LTFU. The results were supported by sequential in-depth and key informant interviews to explore reasons for LTFU. Results Of the 646 patients enrolled, 391 were female (60.5%), 282 were below 30 years (43.6%) and 207 were married (50.1%). A total of 216 patients (33.4%) had no documented outcomes and were considered LTFU. The incidence of LTFU was 21 per 1000 person months (95% confidence interval (CI): 18-25 per 1000 person months). Factors associated with LTFU included having normal weight compared to underweight (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.64, 95% CI: 0.45-0.90, p = 0.011), receiving HIV care from hospitals compared to lower level facilities (aHR 0.22, 95% CI: 0.12-0.41, p < 0.001), and no telephone contact compared to those with a telephone contact (aHR 2.16, 95% CI: 1.33-3.51, p = 0.002). Stigmatization and long waiting times were the prominent reasons for LTFU reported from the in-depth and key informant interviews. Conclusions The incidence of LTFU in public health facilities in Uganda is quite high and is associated with being underweight, not having a telephone contact to receive reminders and receiving care at lower level facilities. Early diagnosis, routine use of patient address locator forms and improved quality of HIV care at lower level health facilities may reduce LTFU among PLHIV.

AB Background High blood pressure is the most significant risk factor for the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Lowering blood pressure is a goal to prevent CKD progression. This study of adults with CKD who have hypertension aimed to determine blood pressure control rates and the treatment patterns of hypertension and to explore factors associated with control of hypertension. Methods This cross-sectional study included all non-dialysis people with CKD stages 3A to 5 under nephrology care in three public renal clinics in Queensland, who joined the CKD.QLD registry from May 2011 to Dec 2015 and had a history of hypertension. Demographic information, other health conditions, laboratory markers and anti-hypertensive medications in use at consent were extracted from the registry. Results Among 1814 CKD people in these three sites in the registry who were age >= 18 years and had CKD stage 3A to 5, 1750 or 96% had a history of hypertension. Of these, the proportion with BP control to < 140/90 mmHg was 61.7% and to < 130/80 mmHg was 36.3%. With target BP < 140/90 mmHg or < 130/80 mmHg, participants aged >= 65 years were 1.23 (95% CI 1.06-1.42) or 1.12 (1.03-1.22) times more likely to have uncontrolled BP compared to those < 65 years old. Participants with severe albuminuria or proteinuria were 1.58 (1.32-1.87) or 1.28 (1.16-1.42, p < 0.001) more likely to have uncontrolled BP compared to those without significant albuminuria or proteinuria. Participants who had cardiovascular disease (CVD) were less likely to have uncontrolled BP compared to those without CVD (0.78, 0.69-0.89 or 0.86, 0.80-0.92). Factors associated with use of more classes of antihypertensive medicines among participants with uncontrolled BP (> 140/90 mmHg) were older age, diabetes, CVD, obesity and severe albuminuria/proteinuria (p < 0.05). Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System inhibitors were the most frequently used medicines, regardless of the number of medicine classes an individual was prescribed. Conclusions Blood pressure control rates in these hypertensive people with CKD was still far from optimal. People with CKD and hypertension aged 65 or older or with severe albuminuria or proteinuria, a group at risk of progression of kidney disease, have higher rates of uncontrolled BP.

AB Purpose
   It is important for patients of working age to resume work after total hip or knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA). A higher preoperative level of physical activity is presumed to lead to a better or faster recovery. Aim is to examine the association between preoperative physical activity (PA) level (total and leisure-time) and time to return-to-work (RTW).
   Methods
   A prospective multicenter survey study. Time to RTW was defined as the length of time (days) from surgery to RTW. PA level was assessed with the SQUASH questionnaire. Questionnaires were filled in before surgery and 6 weeks and 3, 6 and 12 months post-surgery. Multiple regression analyses were conducted separately for THA and TKA patients.
   Results
   243 patients were enrolled. Median age was 56 years; 58% had undergone a THA. Median time to RTW was 85 (THA) and 93 (TKA) days. In the multiple regression analysis, neither preoperative total PA level nor leisure-time PA level were significantly associated with time to RTW.
   Conclusions
   Preoperative physical activity level is not associated with a shorter time to RTW in either THA or TKA patients. Neither preoperative total PA level nor leisure-time PA level showed an association with time to RTW, even after adjusting for covariates.

TI Co-delivery of free vancomycin and transcription factor
   decoy-nanostructured lipid carriers can enhance inhibition of
   methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
SO PLOS ONE

   STABILITY; INFECTION
AB Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is widely regarded as a major public health concern with last resort MRSA treatments like vancomycin now encountering resistant strains. TFDs (Transcription Factor Decoys) are oligonucleotide copies of the DNA-binding sites for transcription factors. They bind to and sequester the targeted transcription factor, thus inhibiting transcription of many genes. By developing TFDs with sequences aimed at inhibiting transcription factors controlling the expression of highly conserved bacterial cell wall proteins, TFDs present as a potential method for inhibiting microbial growth without encountering typical resistance mechanisms. However, the efficient protection and delivery of the TFDs inside the bacterial cells is a critical step for the success of this technology. Therefore, in our study, specific TFDs against S. aureus were complexed with two different types of nanocarriers: cationic nanostructured lipid carriers (cNLCs) and chitosan-based nanoparticles (CSNCs). These TFD-carrier nanocomplexes were characterized for size, zeta potential and TFD complexation or loading efficiency in a variety of buffers. In vitro activity of the nanocomplexes was examined alone and in combination with vancomycin, first in methicillin susceptible strains of S. aureus with the lead candidate advancing to tests against MRSA cultures. Results found that both cNLCs and chitosan-based carriers were adept at complexing and protecting TFDs in a range of physiological and microbiological buffers up to 72 hours. From initial testing, chitosan-TFD particles demonstrated no visible improvements in effect when co-administered with vancomycin. However, co-delivery of cNLC-TFD with vancomycin reduced the MIC of vancomycin by over 50% in MSSA and resulted in significant decreases in viability compared with vancomycin alone in MRSA cultures. Furthermore, these TFD-loaded particles demonstrated very low levels of cytotoxicity and haemolysis in vitro. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at a combined antibiotic/oligonucleotide-TFD approach to combatting MRSA and, as such, highlights a new avenue of MRSA treatment combining traditional small molecules drugs and bacterial gene inhibition.

AB Background The percentage of older adults with hearing loss who stop using their hearing aids and the variables associated with this phenomenon have not been systematically investigated in South America. This problem is relevant to the region since countries such as Colombia, Brazil and Chile have public programmes that provide hearing aids to older adults. The aims of this study were to determine the percentage of older adults fitted with a hearing aid at a public hospital in Chile who subsequently stop using it and the auditory and socio-demographic variables associated with the hazard of discontinuing hearing aid use. Methods A group that included 355 older adults who had been fitted with a hearing aid was studied retrospectively. In a structured interview, participants were asked about socio-demographic variables and answered part of the Chilean National Survey on Health, evaluating self-perceived hearing loss and responding to questions about discontinuation of hearing aid use and their satisfaction with the device. Survival models were applied to determine the hazard of stopping hearing aid use in relation to the variables of interest. Results The rate of discontinuation of hearing aid use reached 21.7%. Older adults stopped using their hearing aids mainly during the first 5-6 months post-fitting, and then this number steadily increased. The income fifth quintile was 2.56 times less likely to stop using the hearing aid compared to the first. Those who self-reported that they could not hear correctly without the hearing aid were 2.62 times less likely to stop using it compared to those who reported normal hearing. The group that was very dissatisfied with the hearing aid was 20.86 times more likely to discontinue use than those who reported satisfaction with the device. Conclusions Socio-demographic variables such as economic income and auditory factors such as self-perceived hearing loss and satisfaction with the device were significantly associated with the hazard of stopping hearing aid use. Self-perceived hearing loss should be considered part of the candidacy criteria for hearing aids in older adults in Chile and other (developing) countries.

AB Background To investigate the association between national culture and national BMI in 53 low-middle- and high-income countries. Methods Data from World Health Survey conducted in 2002-2004 in low-middle- and high-income countries were used. Participants aged 18 years and over were selected using multistage, stratified cluster sampling. BMI was used as an outcome variable. Culture of the countries was measured using Hofstede's cultural dimensions: Uncertainty avoidance, individualism, Power Distance and masculinity. The potential determinants of individual-level BMI were participants' sex, age, marital status, education, occupation as well as household-wealth and location (rural/urban) at the individual-level. The country-level factors used were average national income (GNI-PPP), income inequality (Gini-index) and Hofstede's cultural dimensions. A two-level random-intercepts and fixed-slopes model structure with individuals nested within countries were fitted, treating BMI as a continuous outcome variable. Results A sample of 156,192 people from 53 countries was included in this analysis. The design-based (weighted) mean BMI (SE) in these 53 countries was 23.95(0.08). Uncertainty avoidance (UAI) and individualism (IDV) were significantly associated with BMI, showing that people in more individualistic or high uncertainty avoidance countries had higher BMI than collectivist or low uncertainty avoidance ones. This model explained that one unit increase in UAI or IDV was associated with 0.03 unit increase in BMI. Power distance and masculinity were not associated with BMI of the people. National level Income was also significantly associated with individual-level BMI. Conclusion National culture has a substantial association with BMI of the individuals in the country. This association is important for understanding the pattern of obesity or overweight across different cultures and countries. It is also important to recognise the importance of the association of culture and BMI in developing public health interventions to reduce obesity or overweight.

TI Can hospital accreditation enhance patient experience? Longitudinal

ID PATIENTS PERCEPTION; QUALITY; CARE; SATISFACTION; PERFORMANCE
AB Background Hospital accreditation is expected to improve health care quality and patient satisfaction. However, little and conflicting evidence is currently available to support its effect on patient outcomes, particularly patient experience. Hong Kong recently launched a pilot programme to test an infrastructure for accreditation of both private and public hospitals with the Australian Council on Healthcare Standards. This study aims to evaluate the longitudinal impact of hospital accreditation on patient experience in a publicly-funded university teaching hospital in Hong Kong. Methods Three cross-sectional surveys were conducted at three time points: 9 months pre- accreditation as baseline (T1), three (T2) and fifteen months (T3) post-accreditation. Acute care inpatients aged 18 to 80 were recruited on the second day of hospital admission to complete the Picker Patient Experience Questionnaire-15 (PPE-15). Baseline data was first compared to the 2005 Hong Kong average for public hospitals using t-tests. Data was then analyzed using ANOVA and multiple linear regression to evaluate differences across the three cross-sections and examine the effect of accreditation over time while controlling for covariates. Results 3083 patients (T1 = 896, T2 = 1093, T3 = 1094) completed the survey for a response rate of 83.5, 86.1, and 83.8%, respectively. The hospital baseline domain and summary patient experience scores differed from the Hong Kong public hospital average obtained from the 2005 Thematic Household Survey. All domain and summary patient experience scores declined (improved) over the study period (T1 to T3). The multiple regression results confirmed the time point score comparisons with declining (improving) parameter estimates for T2 and T3 for all domain and summary scores except the 'continuity and transition' domain, for which the declining coefficient was only significant at T3. Conclusions While hospital accreditation has not been shown to improve patient outcomes, this study suggests the accreditation exercise may enhance patient experience. Moreover, it suggests the quality improvement initiatives associated with accreditation may address areas of concern emphasized by Hong Kong patients, such as involvement in care and emotional support from providers.

AB Background Job stress is a strong indicator of presenteeism, but few studies have examined its diverse effects and mediators on presenteeism. This study explored the relationships between job stress, public service motivation (PSM) and presenteeism and how job stress and PSM influence presenteeism in a large national sample of Chinese healthcare workers. Methods A cross-sectional survey including 1392 healthcare workers from 11 Class A tertiary hospitals in eastern, central and western China was used in the analysis. Descriptive statistical analysis, correlation analysis and structural equation modeling were used to test the research hypothesis. Results Hindrance stress was inversely associated with PSM (beta = - 0.27; P < 0.001) but significantly positively associated with presenteeism (beta = 0.35; P < 0.001). PSM was directly inversely associated with presenteeism (beta = - 0.35; P < 0.001). PSM partially mediated the relation of hindrance stress with presenteeism. Conclusions The findings suggest that efforts to prevent presenteeism among healthcare workers in China should emphasize PSM improvement and reduction of hindrance stress.

DE Pneumonia of unknown etiology; Emerging respiratory infectious disease;
   Surveillance system evaluation; Novel influenza viruses; China
AB Background We sought to assess reporting in China's Pneumonia of Unknown Etiology (PUE) passive surveillance system for emerging respiratory infections and to identify ways to improve the PUE surveillance system's detection of respiratory infections of public health significance. Methods From February 29-May 29, 2016, we actively identified and enrolled patients in two hospitals with acute respiratory infections (ARI) that met all PUE case criteria. We reviewed medical records for documented exposure history associated with respiratory infectious diseases, collected throat samples that were tested for seasonal and avian influenza, and interviewed clinicians regarding reasons for reporting or not reporting PUE cases. We described and analyzed the proportion of PUE cases reported and clinician awareness of and practices related to the PUE system. Results Of 2619 ARI admissions in two hospitals, 335(13%) met the PUE case definition; none were reported. Of 311 specimens tested, 18(6%) were seasonal influenza virus-positive; none were avian influenza-positive. < 10% PUE case medical records documented whether or not there were exposures to animals or others with respiratory illness. Most commonly cited reasons for not reporting cases were no awareness of the PUE system (76%) and not understanding the case definition (53%). Conclusions Most clinicians have limited awareness of and are not reporting to the PUE system. Exposures related to respiratory infections are rarely documented in medical records. Increasing clinicians' awareness of the PUE system and including relevant exposure items in standard medical records may increase reporting.

   FORECAST; SYSTEM; IMPACT; SPREAD; ISLAND
AB Background In 2015, the Zika virus spread from Brazil throughout the Americas, posing an unprecedented challenge to the public health community. During the epidemic, international public health officials lacked reliable predictions of the outbreak's expected geographic scale and prevalence of cases, and were therefore unable to plan and allocate surveillance resources in a timely and effective manner. Methods In this work, we present a dynamic neural network model to predict the geographic spread of outbreaks in real time. The modeling framework is flexible in three main dimensions (i) selection of the chosen risk indicator, i.e., case counts or incidence rate; (ii) risk classification scheme, which defines the high-risk group based on a relative or absolute threshold; and (iii) prediction forecast window (1 up to 12 weeks). The proposed model can be applied dynamically throughout the course of an outbreak to identify the regions expected to be at greatest risk in the future. Results The model is applied to the recent Zika epidemic in the Americas at a weekly temporal resolution and country spatial resolution, using epidemiological data, passenger air travel volumes, and vector habitat suitability, socioeconomic, and population data for all affected countries and territories in the Americas. The model performance is quantitatively evaluated based on the predictive accuracy of the model. We show that the model can accurately predict the geographic expansion of Zika in the Americas with the overall average accuracy remaining above 85% even for prediction windows of up to 12 weeks. Conclusions Sensitivity analysis illustrated the model performance to be robust across a range of features. Critically, the model performed consistently well at various stages throughout the course of the outbreak, indicating its potential value at any time during an epidemic. The predictive capability was superior for shorter forecast windows and geographically isolated locations that are predominantly connected via air travel. The highly flexible nature of the proposed modeling framework enables policy makers to develop and plan vector control programs and case surveillance strategies which can be tailored to a range of objectives and resource constraints.

AB Background Internationally, women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lack knowledge about their disease, which limits their ability to take responsibility for self-care and creates negative psychosocial effects, including marital problems. Normally, screening is performed in primary care, and in case of abnormal results, the patient is referred to specialized care for follow-up and treatment. Given the lack of international literature regarding patients' experiences in primary and specialized healthcare, our study aims to: (a) investigate how women with CIN perceive the communication and management of information by healthcare providers at different moments of their healthcare and (b) identify these women's informational needs. Methods A qualitative exploratory study was carried out in a gynecology unit of a public hospital of the Galician Health Care Service (Spain). Participants were selected through purposive sampling. The sample consisted of 21 women aged 21 to 52 years old with a confirmed diagnosis of CIN. Semistructured interviews were recorded and transcribed. A thematic analysis was carried out, including triangulation of researchers for analysis verification. Results Two analytical themes were identified. The first was communication gaps in the diagnosis and management of information in primary and specialized healthcare. These gaps occurred in the following moments of the healthcare process: (a) cervical cancer screening in primary care, (b) waiting time until referral to specialized care, (c) first consultation in specialized care, and (d) after consultation in specialized care. The second theme was participants' unmatched informational needs. The doubts and informational needs of women during their healthcare process related to the following subthemes: (a) HPV transmission, (b) HPV infection symptoms and consequences, and (c) CIN treatment and follow-up. Conclusions This study shows that women who have a diagnosis of CIN experience important healthcare informational challenges when accessing primary and specialized care that have several implications for their wellbeing. The information given is limited, which makes it difficult for women to understand and participate in the decision making regarding the prevention and treatment of CIN. Service coordination among different levels of care and the availability of educational materials at any given time would improve the patients' healthcare experience.

AB Background General practitioners (GPs) are among the most important resources of healthcare system and public health is considerably influenced by the function of this group. Income inequality among GPs considerably affects the motivation and performance of this group. The present study aims to examine the income inequality among Iranian GPs in order to provide the necessary evidence for health human resource policy. Methods In this cross-sectional study, the distribution of income and wage inequality among GPs was investigated using income quintiles. We also used the Dagum's model to analyze the inequality between different groups of GPs through the decomposition of the Gini coefficient. Moreover, a regression model was used to determine the effective factors on GPs' income. Results The results of this study indicated that income and wages of GPs in the highest quintile were eight times more than those of doctors at the lowest quintile. Regression estimates showed that factors such as gender, practice setting, and activity as the family physician (P < 0.001) were effective on income of GPs; and also male and self-employed GPs had significantly more wage (P < 0.001). Total Gini coefficient of GPs' income and wage were estimated at 0.403 and 0.412, respectively. Highest monthly income was found in GPs with 16-20 years practice experience ($8358) based on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), male ($8339 PPP), and self-employed GPs ($8134 PPP) subgroup. However, the female ($5389 PPP) and single ($5438 PPP) GPs had the lowest income. Population share; income/wage share; income/wage mean; Gini coefficient; and within, between and overlap decomposed components of Gini coefficient are also reported for each GPs subgroups. Conclusions We found significant inequalities in income and wages among Iranian GPs. Adjustment of income based on working hours indicated that one of the most common causes of income inequality among GPs in Iran was different workloads among different groups. Since the motivation and function of physicians can be influenced by income inequality, policymakers in the health system should consider factors increasing such inequalities.

AB Background In Germany, antenatal influenza vaccination is recommended since 2010, but uptake remains low. Several countries recently introduced antenatal pertussis vaccination, which is currently under consideration in Germany. We conducted a survey among gynaecologists on attitudes, practices and barriers regarding influenza and pertussis vaccination during pregnancy. Methods Gynaecologists were invited to complete a pre-tested, 24-item questionnaire published in the German Professional Association of Gynaecologists' journal in September 2017 within 2 months. Associations between variables were examined using Chi-Squared, Fischer's Exact or t-tests. Variables associated with gynaecologists' self-reported implementation of vaccination in pregnant women were identified using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results Of 867 participants (response 11%), 91.4 and 59.4% reported currently vaccinating pregnant women against influenza and pertussis, respectively. Gynaecologists who reported obtaining annual influenza vaccination and actively informing their patients about these vaccinations were significantly more likely to vaccinate pregnant women against influenza (96.5% vs. 65.7 and 95.1% vs. 62.2%) and pertussis (63.1% vs. 44.3 and 82.4% vs. 12.9%). Performing influenza vaccination was least likely among gynaecologists who perceived logistical difficulties as a vaccination barrier (35.9%), while pertussis vaccination was least likely if the lacking official recommendation (32.0%), logistical difficulties (27.1%), safety concerns (17.5%) and limited vaccine effectiveness (11.1%) were perceived as barriers. Of participants not yet vaccinating pregnant women against pertussis, 86.5% reported they would follow an official recommendation. Including vaccination recommendations in the maternity record (95.2%) and informing the public (88.7%) and health care professionals (86.6%) were considered the most suitable measures to achieve high pertussis vaccination coverage. Conclusions The large proportion reporting performance of influenza vaccination during pregnancy and high acceptance of a potential recommendation for pertussis vaccination reflected positive attitudes towards vaccination among participants. However, factors associated with failure to vaccinate may be more prevalent among non-participants. Results suggest that gynaecologists' confidence in vaccination is crucial for implementing vaccination in pregnancy. Thus, doubts on vaccine effectiveness and safety should be allayed among gynaecologists and pregnant women via various communication channels, and solutions for logistical barriers sought. Including antenatal vaccination recommendations in the maternity record would serve as an important reminder for both groups.

AB Background Equity in medical resource utilization is a crucial concern in countries with national health insurance systems. From the perspective of an active aging framework, public health insurance is one of the pillars of economic security, as suggested by the World Bank, to achieve the goal of social security for older adults. This study thus sought to quantify income-related inequality in national health insurance systems, especially during the global economic crisis of 2007-2008. Methods By employing the Taiwan National Health Interview Surveys (2005 and 2009) datasets, we analyzed the socioeconomic inequality of outpatient service utilization for older Taiwanese adults during the financial crisis of 2007-2008. We used corrected concentration indices (CCIs) to examine inequalities over time. Furthermore, we decomposed socioeconomic inequalities to reveal the contributions of determinant factors. The dependent variables related to whether participants had used outpatient services in the previous month, and the independent factors included individual's needs, enabling, predisposing, and environmental factors proposed by Andersen model. Results The sample consisted of 2415 observations in 2005 and 2554 observations in 2009. The income-related health care inequality was minor from pro-rich to pro-poor across the study duration, although the difference was insignificant (women: from a concentration index [CI] of 0.0256 in 2005 to a CI of - 0.0098 in 2009; men: from a CI of 0.0379 in 2005 to a CI of 0.0310 in 2009). We used a probit model to analyze the effect of explanatory factors on outpatient resource utilization by men and women. After other factors were controlled for, we found that that the income variable had a positive and significant effect on outpatient service utilization in 2009 and the absolute contribution of income to inequality notably increased from 0.0480 in 2005 to 0.3247 in 2009 for older women. Conclusions In conclusion, Taiwan's National Health Insurance system guarantees the accessibility of health care services to older adults, but slight income-related inequality was maintained in the outpatient resource utilization of women during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Close attention should be paid to the vulnerability of women during times of economic insecurity.

AB Background Client satisfaction is the best indicator of quality service provision and has been found to correlate with continuity of care perceived by the client. The measurement of client satisfaction helps in understanding willingness and decisions to return for future services. Thus, this study aimed at assessing the level and factors associated with client satisfaction of FP services among family planning users. Methods An institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted on 492 family planning users in Public health facilities of Jigjiga town, Eastern Ethiopia from February 10 to March 10, 2017. Participants were chosen by systematic random sampling and interviewed immediately after having received family planning service using via a structured and pre-tested questionnaire. The data were entered into Epi Info 7 and then exported to SPSS 20 for analysis. All associations with client satisfaction were tested for statistical significance with alpha set at the 0.05 level. Result The findings of this study showed that the overall client satisfaction with FP services among FP users of public health facilities of Jigjiga town was 41.7% with 95% CI of (37 - 46.1%). Knowledge on FP [adjusted odds ratio, AOR (95% CI) = 0.037 (0.019-0.072)], demonstrate how to use the method [AOR (95% CI) = 16.1 (8.4-30.7)], describing side effect of the method [AOR (95% CI) = 2.4 (1.41-4.23)] and distance of FP user's home to health facility [AOR (95% CI) = 0.24 (0.14-0.42)] were found to be significantly associated with the client satisfaction of FP services. Conclusions The overall client satisfaction with FP services was relatively low. Knowledge of FP, demonstrating how to use the method, describing the side effect of the method and distance of FP user's home to health facilities were found to be factors that influence client satisfaction with family planning services. Thus, efforts should be made to improve on client interaction especially on the information given and knowledge of clients.

AB Background Despite clinical practice guideline recommendations that cardiovascular disease patients participate, cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs are highly unavailable and underutilized. This is particularly true in low-resource settings, where the epidemic is at its' worst. The reasons are complex, and include health system, program and patient-level barriers. This is the first study to assess barriers at all these levels concurrently, and to do so in a low-resource setting. Methods In this cross-sectional study, data from three cohorts (healthcare administrators, CR coordinators and patients) were triangulated. Healthcare administrators from all institutions offering cardiac services, and providers from all CR programs in public and private institutions of Minas Gerais state, Brazil were invited to complete a questionnaire. Patients from a random subsample of 12 outpatient cardiac clinics and 11 CR programs in these institutions completed the CR Barriers Scale. Results Thirty-two (35.2%) healthcare administrators, 16 (28.6%) CR providers and 805 cardiac patients (305 [37.9%] attending CR) consented to participate. Administrators recognized the importance of CR, but also the lack of resources to deliver it; CR providers noted referral is lacking. Patients who were not enrolled in CR reported significantly greater barriers related to comorbidities/functional status, perceived need, personal/family issues and access than enrollees, and enrollees reported travel/work conflicts as greater barriers than non-enrollees (all p < 0.01). Conclusions The inter-relationship among barriers at each level is evident; without resources to offer more programs, there are no programs to which physicians can refer (and hence inform and encourage patients to attend), and patients will continue to have barriers related to distance, cost and transport. Advocacy for services is needed.

AB Background Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is an emerging zoonotic infectious disease caused by hantaviruses which circulate worldwide. So far, it was still considered as one of serious public health problems in China. The present study aimed to reveal the stabilities and variations of hantavirus infection in Hebei province located in North China through a long-term retrospective observation. Methods The epidemiological data of HFRS cases from all 11 cities of Hebei province since 1981 through 2016 were collected and descriptively analyzed. The rodent densities, species compositions and virus-carrying rates of different regions were collected from six separated rodent surveillance points which set up since 2007. The molecular diversity and phylogenetic relationship of hantaviruses circulating among rodents were analyzed based on partial viral glycoprotein gene. Results HFRS cases have been reported every year in Hebei province, since the first local case was identified in 1981. The epidemic history can be artificially divided into three phases and a total of 55,507 HFRS cases with 374 deaths were reported during 1981-2016. The gender and occupational factors of susceptible population were invarible throughout, however age of that was gradually aging. The annual outbreak peak always present in spring, while the main epidemic region had gradully altered from south to northeast. Surveillance of rodents revealed that residential rodents significantly possessed higher density and virus-carring rate than field rodents. The house rat, Rattus norvegicus, was the dominant rodent species and Seoul virus S3 sub-genotype which is continued but slightly evolving perhaps to be the sole pathogen for local HFRS cases of Hebei province. Conclusions This long-term province-wide surveillance and epidemiological analysis has revealed the stabilities and variations of hantavirus infection in North China. In order to improve current prevention and control strategies of HFRS in China, all surveillance should be continuously enhanced and variations should be paid more attentions.

AB Background Intestinal infectious diseases (IIDs) have caused numerous deaths worldwide, particularly among children. In China, eight IIDs are listed as notifiable infectious diseases, including cholera, poliomyelitis, dysentery, typhoid and paratyphoid (TAP), viral Hepatitis A, viral Hepatitis E, hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) and other infectious diarrhoeal diseases (OIDDs). The aim of the study is to analyse the spatio-temporal distribution of IIDs from 2006 to 2016. Methods Data on the incidence of IIDs from 2006 to 2016 were collected from the public health science data centre issued by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. This study applied seasonal decomposition analysis, spatial autocorrelation analysis and space-time scan analysis. Plots and maps were constructed to visualize the spatio-temporal distribution of IIDs. Results Regarding temporal analysis, the incidence of HFMD and Hepatitis E showed a distinct increasing trend, while the incidence of TAP, dysentery, and Hepatitis A presented decreasing trends over the last decade. The incidence of OIID remained steady. Summer is the season with the greatest number of cases of different IIDs. Regarding the spatial distribution, approximately all p values for the global Moran's I from 2006 to 2016 were less than 0.05, indicating that the incidences of the epidemics were unevenly distributed throughout the country. The high-risk areas for HFMD and OIDD were located in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan (BTT) region and south China. The high-risk areas for TAP were located in some parts of southwest China. A higher incidence rates for dysentery and Hepatitis A were observed in the BTT region and some west provincial units. The high-risk areas for Hepatitis E were the BTT region and the Yangtze River Delta area. Conclusions Based on our temporal and spatial analysis of IIDs, we identified the high-risk periods and clusters of regions for the diseases. HFMD and OIDD exhibited high incidence rates, which reflected the negligence of Class C diseases by the government. At the same time, the incidence rate of Hepatitis E gradually surpassed Hepatitis A. The authorities should pay more attention to Class C diseases and Hepatitis E. Regardless of the various distribution patterns of IIDs, disease-specific, location-specific, and disease-combined interventions should be established.

AB Background Tuberculosis (TB) is among the world's top public health challenges and the leading killer of people with HIV, yet is a treatable disease. This study aimed to assess, in a real-world setting, the implementation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and Cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) policy, specific interventions proven to benefit patients in HIV-associated TB care. Methods This retrospective cohort study was conducted in Botswana in the Serowe/Palapye district, a largely urban district with a high burden of HIV-associated TB with a high case fatality, at Segkoma and Palapye hospitals and their feeder clinics. Between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2013, confirmed HIV-positive patients aged >= 15 years with a confirmed TB diagnosis and medical record available were included in the analysis. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare time to death for the group of patients on ART and the group of patients not on ART during TB treatment. Cox proportional hazard regression was undertaken to identify predictors of mortality. Results Of the 300 patients included in the study, 217 (72%) were ART experienced at TB diagnosis. Of these, 86 (40%) had TB within 3 months following ART initiation. Of the 83 (28%) patients who were ART-naive at TB diagnosis, 40 (48%) were commenced on ART during TB treatment, with 24 (60%) patients commencing within 4 weeks following TB treatment initiation. The overall ART uptake was 84%, while cotrimoxazole preventive therapy uptake was 100%. There were 45 deaths (15%), ART-experienced patients during TB treatment accounted for 30 deaths (30/257; 14%), while those who were not ART-experienced during TB treatment accounted for 15 deaths (15/43; 35%). There was a significant difference in survival time between patients with no ART use during TB treatment and those with ART use during TB treatment (log rank p < 0.001). Patients with no ART use during TB treatment were more likely to die within the first 2 months. Conclusion The implementation of CPT policy is a substantial success. Strengthening the implementation of ART policy could improve survival among HIV-associated TB patients.

AB Background Salmonella has been considered as one of the most important foodborne pathogens that threatened breeding industry and public health. To investigate the prevalence and characterization of Salmonella isolated from duck farms and a slaughterhouse in Shandong province, a total of 49 Salmonella strains were isolated from 2342 samples from four duck farms and one duck slaughterhouse in Jinan and Tai'an, Shandong province, China. Results Among the isolates, S. Enteritidis (20/49, 40.8%) and S. Anatum (10/49, 20.4%) were the most prevalent, and high resistance rates were detected for erythromycin (49/49, 100.0%) and nalidixic acid (47/49, 95.9%). Class I integrons were detected in 17 isolates (34.7%17/49), which contained gene cassettes aadA7 + aac3-Id(15/17) and aadA5 + dfrA17 (2/17). Eleven different kinds of resistance genes were detected while bla(TEM)(36/49, 73.5%) was the most prevalent, followed by sul2(14/49, 28.6%). Thirteen virulence genes were tested, and all of the strains carried invA, hilA and sipA. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) results showed that seven sequence types (STs) were identified; ST11 was the most prevalent ST (20/49, 40.8%), followed by ST2441 (10/49, 20.4%). There was a strong correlation between STs and serovars. The results of pulsed field gel electrophoresis(PFGE) showed that 39 PFGE patterns were generated from 49 Salmonella strains. PFGE patterns were mostly diverse and revealed high similarity between the isolates from the same sampling sites. Conclusions The presence of Salmonella infections among duck farms revealed that ducks could also be potential reservoirs for Salmonella. The high resistance rates against commonly used antimicrobials suggested a need for more reasonable use of antimicrobials, as well as for investigating substitutes for antimicrobials.

AB Background In China, both population aging and kidney damage has become emerging public health challenges. Despite the number of elders is huge, data on kidney damage in this population are scarce. The present study aimed to describe the prevalence of kidney damage among older adults in Wuhan, China. Methods To describe the prevalence of kidney damage among Chinese elderly, the health screening data of 350,881 adults older than 65 years in Wuhan, China were collected and analyzed. Kidney damage was defined as eGFR less than 60 mL/min per 1 center dot 73 m(2) or the presence of proteinuria. Decreased renal function was defined as an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Proteinuria was defined as urine protein >= 1+ and without urine WBC or nitrite positive. The associated risk factors of eGFR decline and kidney damage were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. Results The age-standardized prevalence of kidney damage, decreased renal function and proteinuria was 17.2, 13.5 and 5.3%. Among the patients, up to 74.4% was stage 3. The prevalence of kidney damage and eGFR decline were higher in suburbs than in urban (18.3% vs 16.0 and 14.6% vs 12.4%). Factors independently associated with kidney damage were age, female, BMI, abdominal circumference, hypertension, diabetes, stroke and coronary heart disease. Conclusions Kidney damage has become an important public health problem in Chinese elderly. More attention should be paid to elderly lived in suburbs or rural area in our further work.

AB Background The purpose of this study was to examine specific energy balance-related behaviors (sedentary behaviors, physical activity, and dietary) associating with adolescent weight loss intent using data from the 2017 US Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS). Methods This was a cross-sectional study that employed a multi-stage cluster sampling procedure to obtain a representative sample of US adolescents. The target population consisted of public and private high schoolers from grades 9 through 12. The number of sampled adolescents was 18,324 with 14,765 of the 18,324 sampled students (Mean age = 15.9 (1.3) years) submitting questionnaires with usable data (81% response rate). The outcome was intent to lose weight with specific energy-balance related behaviors examined as predictor variables. A weighted logistic regression model was employed to examine the associations between sedentary behaviors, physical activity, and dietary-related variables with weight loss intent controlling for age, sex, BMI percentile, and race/ethnicity. Results Variables associating with adolescent intent to lose weight included 3 or more hours of video game playing (OR = 1.15, 95%CI: 1.01-1.31, p = 0.028), achieving 60 min of physical activity daily (OR = 0.66, 95%CI: 0.59-0.73, p < 0.001), daily breakfast consumption (OR = 0.76, 95%CI: 0.67-0.87, p < 0.001) and weekly salad consumption (OR = 1.30, 95%CI: 1.12-1.52, p = 0.001). Conclusions Meeting physical activity guidelines and regular breakfast consumption associated with lower odds of weight loss intent and video game playing and salad consumption associated with higher odds of weight loss intent in a representative sample of US adolescents. Therefore, there is a discordance between adolescent weight loss intent and the engagement in specific energy balance-related health behaviors, particularly physical activity.

AB Background Poor diet is a significant contributor to the burden of global disease. There are numerous policies available to address poor diets; however, these policies often require public support to encourage policy action. The current study aimed to understand the level of public support for a range of food policies and the factors associated with policy support. Methods An online survey measuring support for 13 food policies was completed by 19,857 adults in Australia, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US). The proportion of respondents that supported each policy was compared between countries, and the association between demographic characteristics and policy support was analysed using multivariate logistic regression. Results The level of support varied between policies, with the highest support for policies that provided incentives (e.g., price subsidies) or information (e.g., calorie labelling on menus), and the lowest support for those that imposed restrictions (e.g., restrictions on sponsorship of sport events). This pattern of support was similar in all countries, but the level differed, with Mexico generally recording the highest support across policies, and the US the lowest. Several demographic characteristics were associated with policy support; however, these relationships varied between countries. Conclusion The results suggest that support for food policies is influenced by several factors related to the policy design, country, and individual demographic characteristics. Policymakers and advocates should consider these factors when developing and promoting policy options.

AB Background E-cigarettes have grown in popularity around the world since 2003. Although marketed as a smoking cessation tool, e-cigarettes can lead to tobacco cigarette smoking in youth. In Canada, among all age groups, youth and young adults have the highest prevalence of e-cigarette use. The objective of this study was to assess the factors associated with e-cigarette use among youth and young adults in Canada, and to specifically examine the association between alcohol, marijuana and illicit drug use. Methods Data from the 2017 Canadian Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey were used. The sample was restricted to those aged 15-24 years (n = 10,322), and main outcome defined as 'E-cigarette use in the past 30-days'. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess the association between the main outcome and substance use variables (illicit drug, marijuana and alcohol use), tobacco exposure variables, and demographic and health-related factors. Results 6.2% Canadians aged 15-24 reported using e-cigarettes in the past 30-days, while 23.9% reported having ever tried e-cigarettes. Twenty-three percent of the past 30-day users reported using e-cigarettes every day and 72.5% of the past 30-day users reported having nicotine in their last e-cigarette. Additionally, youth aged 15-17 were 4.95 times more likely to be e-cigarette users as compared to those aged 22-24 (OR: 4.95, 95% CI: 3.1-7.9). Moreover, e-cigarette use was significantly associated with marijuana use (OR:4.17, 95% CI: 2.6-6.7) and alcohol use (OR: 5.08, 95% CI: 2.9-9.0), and approached significance with illicit drug use (OR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.0-2.9). Furthermore, being a current smoker (OR: 2.93, 95% CI: 1.8-4.7) and male (OR: 2.28, 95% CI: 1.5-3.4) was significantly associated with the outcome. Conclusion This study is nationally representative and provides insight into e-cigarette use among youth and young adults aged 15-24 years. Given that e-cigarettes can be used as illicit drug delivery systems, more studies are needed to understand how Canadian youth and young adults are using e-cigarettes. Stricter restrictions on public e-cigarette smoking, and awareness campaigns informing youth of risks of e-cigarette smoking should be implemented.

TI Leprosy in elderly people and the profile of a retrospective cohort in
   an endemic region of the Brazilian Amazon
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
AB Author summary Leprosy, despite being an ancient disease, still represents a challenge to public health systems today. There are still just a few studies about it, particularly among the elderly. It is known that they constitute a very heterogeneous group in terms of immune response to infections, alterations to the peripheral nervous system and predisposition to situations of vulnerability and functional dependency. The Amazon region is a hyperendemic region for leprosy and has been trying to address, along with the rest of Brazil, a rapid increase in the population's life expectancy. This article surveys medical records from elderly people diagnosed with leprosy in a five-year period at the metropolitan region of Belem, state of Para (Brazil), identifying a predominance of the multibacillary forms of the disease, a high prevalence of leprosy reactions mainly during treatment with multidrug therapy, and the presence of some physical incapacity in most of the people evaluated. It is expected that this study will contribute to knowledge about the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of leprosy among the elderly and stimulate the making of new studies on the theme.
   Background Leprosy has a global presence; more than 180 thousand new cases were registered in 2013, 15% of which were found in the Americas. The elderly are a very susceptible demographic in terms of developing illnesses, mainly because of characteristics natural to the senescence of the human organism. This study's goals were to analyze leprosy in an elderly population from a hyperendemic region of the Brazilian Amazon in a historical series from 2004 to 2013 and to determine the clinical and epidemiological profile of a series of leprosy cases of elderly people in the period spanning from 2009 to 2013. Methods To achieve these goals, an observational, longitudinal, retrospective and descriptive study was put together to analyze leprosy in elderly people from data acquired from the Notification Aggravations Information System. Furthermore, a profile of the disease from a retrospective cohort based on data collected from medical records was developed. Results The number of new cases and the leprosy detection rate decreased across the observed period but remained stable among the elderly. The trend for the next ten years indicates decreases in the number of cases and in the detection rate in the general population and an increase in only the elderly. The overall profile was characterized by a predominance of males (64.32%), the multibacillary clinical form (87.57%), Type 1 reaction episodes (37.50%) and some physical incapacity at diagnosis (49.19%). The risk of reaction was greater in the first six months of multidrug therapy, and the positive result from the skin smear was associated with the greater chance of reactional condition development. Conclusions The resulting data demonstrate that leprosy amongst the elderly deserves attention because of the increased susceptibility to disability in this age group, with their higher risk of reaction and their greater level of co-morbidity.

AB Background Chagas disease (CD) affects over 300,000 people in the United States, but fewer than 1% have been diagnosed and less than 0.3% have received etiological treatment. This is a significant public health concern because untreated CD can produce fatal complications. What factors prevent people with CD from accessing diagnosis and treatment in a nation with one of the world's most advanced healthcare systems? Methodology/Principal findings This analysis of barriers to diagnosis and treatment of CD in the US reflects the opinions of the authors more than a comprehensive discussion of all the available evidence. To enrich our description of barriers, we have conducted an exploratory literature review and cited the experience of the main US clinic providing treatment for CD. We list 34 barriers, which we group into four overlapping dimensions: systemic, comprising gaps in the public health system; structural, originating from political and economic inequalities; clinical, including toxicity of medications and diagnostic challenges; and psychosocial, encompassing fears and stigma. Conclusions We propose this multidimensional framework both to explain the persistently low numbers of people with CD who are tested and treated and as a potential basis for organizing a public health response, but we encourage others to improve on our approach or develop alternative frameworks. We further argue that expanding access to diagnosis and treatment of CD in the US means asserting the rights of vulnerable populations to obtain timely, quality healthcare.

TI Predicting the impact of household contact and mass chemoprophylaxis on

AB Background The country of Kiribati is a small Pacific island nation which had a new case detection rate of 191 per 100,000 in 2016, and is one of the few countries yet to reach the WHO leprosy elimination goal. Chemoprophylaxis of household contacts of new cases, or to the whole population in a highly endemic areas have been found to be effective in reducing new case rates. This study investigated the potential impact of different chemoprophylaxis strategies on future cases in South Tarawa, the main population centre of Kiribati. Methodology The microsimulation model SIMCOLEP was calibrated to simulate the South Tarawa population and past leprosy control activities, and replicate annual new cases from 1989 to 2016. The impact of six different strategies for delivering one round of single dose rifampicin (SDR) chemoprophylaxis to household contacts of new cases and/or one or three rounds of SDR to the whole population was modelled from 2017 to 2030. Principal Findings Our model predicted that continuing the existing control program of high levels of public awareness, passive case detection, and treatment with multidrug treatment would lead to a substantial reduction in cases but this was less effective than all modelled intervention scenarios. Mass chemoprophylaxis led to a faster initial decline in cases than household contact chemoprophylaxis alone, however the decline under the latter was sustained for longer. The greatest cumulative impact was for household contact chemoprophylaxis with three rounds of mass chemoprophylaxis at one-year intervals. Conclusions The results suggest that control of leprosy would be achieved most rapidly with a combination of intensive population-based and household chemoprophylaxis. These findings may be generalisable to other countries where crowding places social contacts as well as household contacts of cases at risk of developing leprosy.
   Author summary Leprosy rates in Kiribati are some of the highest in the world and it is one of the few countries yet to reach the World Health Organization leprosy elimination goal of a prevalence of less than one case per 10,000 population. The greatest burden is in the capital South Tarawa and the connected islet of Betio. Interest has increased for the use of chemoprophylaxis, the administration of preventive antibiotics to apparently healthy individuals who may be incubating the disease, which has been demonstrated to be effective in both household contacts and the whole population in two recent studies. In this study we used the individual-based model SIMCOLEP to predict the impact of six difference scenarios using single dose rifampicin (SDR) chemoprophylaxis in household contacts and/or the entire population on future new cases in South Tarawa. We found that all chemoprophylaxis strategies were predicted to be more effective than the current control strategy, particularly a combination of household contact chemoprophylaxis alongside three rounds given to the entire population in consecutive years.

TI Field effectiveness of new visceral leishmaniasis regimens after 1 year
   following treatment within public health facilities in Bihar, India
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID KALA-AZAR; MILTEFOSINE; EFFICACY; FAILURE
AB Background An earlier open label, prospective, non-randomized, non-comparative, multi-centric study conducted within public health facilities in Bihar, India (CTRI/2012/08/002891) measured the field effectiveness of three new treatment regimens for visceral leishmaniasis (VL): single dose AmBisome (SDA), and combination therapies of AmBisome and miltefosine (AmB+Milt) and miltefosine and paromomycin (Milt+PM) up to 6 months follow-up. The National Vector Borne Disease Control Program (NVBDCP) recommended an extended follow up at 12 months post-treatment of the original study cohort to quantify late relapses. Methods The 1,761 patients enrolled in the original study with the three new regimens were contacted and traced between 10 and 36 months following completion of treatment to determine their health status and any occurrence of VL relapse. Results Of 1,761 patients enrolled in the original study, 1,368 were traced at the extended follow-up visit: 711 (80.5%), 295 (83.2%) and 362 (71.5%) patients treated with SDA, AmB+Milt and Milt+PM respectively. Of those traced, a total of 75 patients were reported to have relapsed by the extended follow-up; 45 (6.3%) in the SDA, 25 (8.5%) in the AmB+Milt and 5 (1.4%) in the Milt+PM arms. Of the 75 relapse cases, 55 had already been identified in the 6-months follow-up and 20 were identified as new cases of relapse at extended follow-up; 7 in the SDA, 10 in the AmB+Milt and 3 in the Milt+PM arms. Conclusion Extending follow-up beyond the standard 6 months identified additional relapses, suggesting that 12-month sentinel follow-up may be useful as a programmatic tool to better identify and quantify relapses. With limited drug options, there remains an urgent need to develop effective new chemical entities (NCEs) for VL.
   Author summary In 2010, the WHO Expert Committee recommended liposomal amphotericin B (in single or multiple doses) along with three short combination treatment regimens containing liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB), miltefosine (Milt) and/or paromomycin (PM) as preferred options to replace the existing miltefosine monotherapy for kala-azar treatment in South Asia. The Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) in partnership with Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Science (RMRI-Regional ICMR institute), State Health Society Bihar, and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) conducted a phase 4 field effectiveness study to determine the effectiveness and to assess the safety and feasibility of using single dose LAmB, and the combination therapies of LAmB+Milt and Milt+PM for the treatment of VL at public healthcare facility settings in India. Based on the provisional results of this effectiveness study at 6 months follow-up, the Indian government revised the national policy in August 2014, introducing SDA as first option and Milt+PM as second option to replace miltefosine monotherapy in the kala-azar elimination initiative. National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) expert committee recommended to follow up this large cohort of patients for one year to identify relapses yielding further evidence on new treatment regimens.

AB Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV) is a zoonotic flavivirus that represents the most significant etiology of childhood viral neurological infections throughout the Asia. During the last 20 years, JEV genotype dominance has shifted from genotype III (GIII) to genotype I (GI). To date, the exact mechanism of this displacement is still not known. Culex (Cx.) mosquitoes are the most common species in China and play an essential role in maintaining JEV enzootic transmission cycle. In this study, we used Cx. pipiens mosquitoes from China as an in vivo mosquito model to explore if mosquitoes played a potential role in JEV genotype shift. We exposed female Cx. pipiens mosquitoes orally to either GI or GIII JEV strains. Midgut, whole mosquitoes, secondary organs, and salivary glands of JEV-infected mosquitoes were collected at 7 and 14 days of post infection (dpi) and subjected to measure the infection rate, replication kinetics, dissemination rate and transmission potential of the infected JEV strains in Cx. pipiens mosquitoes by 50% tissue culture infective dose assay. We found that Cx. pipiens mosquito was competent vector for both GI and GIII JEV infection, with similar infection rates and growth kinetics. After the establishment of infection, Cx. pipiens mosquitoes disseminated both JEV genotypes to secondary organs at similar rates of dissemination. A few GI-infected mosquito salivary glands (16.2%) were positive for GI virus, whereas GIII virus was undetectable in GIII-infected mosquito salivary glands at 7 dpi. However, 29.4% (5/17) and 36.3% (8/22) were positive for GI- and GIII-infected mosquito salivary glands at 14 dpi, respectively, showing an increase in JEV positive rate. No statistical difference in the transmission rate between GI- and GIII-infected mosquitoes was detected. Our experiment data demonstrated that GI and GIII viruses have similar infectivity in Cx. pipiens mosquitoes, suggesting that Cx. pipiens mosquitoes from China may not play a critical role in JEV genotype shift. Although the current data were obtained solely from Cx. pipiens mosquitoes, it is likely that the conclusion drawn could be extrapolated to the role of mosquitoes in JEV genotype shift.
   Author summary Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) causes encephalitis and reproductive disorder in humans and pigs respectively, causing a serious impact on public health and pig industry. In nature JEV life cycle include both vertebrates (birds and pigs) as well as invertebrates (mosquitoes). Phylogenetic studies confirmed that JEV has five geographically and epidemiologically distinct genotypes (GI-V). Genotype III (GIII) was an endemic strain in Asia, but recently genotype I (GI) has displaced GIII as the most frequently isolated virus genotype. It is unclear if mosquitoes play a role in this genotype shift or not. Both genotypes are endemic in China and primarily transmitted by different species of Culex (Cx.) mosquitoes. Cx. Mosquitoes are the most common species in China and their role in this genotype shift was not studied previously. In the present study, we used Cx. pipiens mosquitoes from China as an in vivo mosquito model and challenged with GI and GIII JEV strains to explore if mosquitoes played a potential role in JEV genotype shift. Our investigation showed that GI and GIII viruses had similar infectivity in Cx. pipiens mosquitoes which highlighted that Cx. pipiens mosquitoes from China may not play a critical role in the genotype shift. Although the current data were obtained solely from Cx. pipiens mosquitoes, it is likely that the conclusion drawn could be extrapolated to the role of mosquitoes in JEV genotype shift.

   SPREAD; FEVER
AB Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) is the causative agent of typhoid fever, a systemic human infection with a burden exceeding 20 million cases each year that occurs disproportionately among children in low and middle income countries. Antimicrobial therapy is the mainstay for treatment, but resistance to multiple agents is common. Here we report genotypes and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants detected from routine whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 533 S. Typhi isolates referred to Public Health England between April 2014 and March 2017, 488 (92%) of which had accompanying patient travel information obtained via an enhanced surveillance questionnaire. The majority of cases involved S. Typhi 4.3.1 (H58) linked with travel to South Asia (59%). Travel to East and West Africa were associated with genotypes 4.3.1 and 3.3.1, respectively. Point mutations in the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR), associated with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, were very common (85% of all cases) but the frequency varied significantly by region of travel: 95% in South Asia, 43% in East Africa, 27% in West Africa. QRDR triple mutants, resistant to ciprofloxacin, were restricted to 4.3.1 lineage II and associated with travel to India, accounting for 23% of cases reporting travel to the country. Overall 24% of isolates were MDR, however the frequency varied significantly by region and country of travel: 27% in West Africa, 52% in East Africa, 55% in Pakistan, 24% in Bangladesh, 3% in India. MDR determinants were plasmid-borne (IncHI1 PST2 plasmids) in S. Typhi 3.1.1 linked to West Africa, but in all other regions MDR was chromosomally integrated in 4.3.1 lineage I. We propose that routine WGS data from travel-associated cases in industrialised countries could serve as informal sentinel AMR genomic surveillance data for countries where WGS is not available or routinely performed.
   Author summary Our data demonstrate how routine WGS data produced by Public Health England can be further mined for informal passive surveillance of Salmonella Typhi circulating in different geographical regions where typhoid is endemic. We have shown the public health utility of a simplified approach to WGS reporting based on the GenoTyphi genotyping framework and nomenclature, which doesn't require the generation of a phylogenetic tree or other phylogenetic analysis. These approaches yielded results consistent with previously reported antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns of S. Typhi, including prevalence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) and fluoroquinolone resistance in different regions in association with different pathogen variants. These data provide a rationale and framework for the extraction and reporting of geographically stratified genotype and AMR data from public health labs in non-endemic countries. Prospective analysis and reporting of such data could potentially detect shifts in regional S. Typhi populations, such as replacement or spread of different subclades and the emergence and dissemination of MDR, fluoroquinolone resistant and/or extensively drug resistant S. Typhi, providing valuable data to inform typhoid control measures in low and middle income countries that are still building their genomics capacity.

AB Author summary Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), also known as kala-azar, is a potentially fatal disease caused by intracellular parasites of the Leishmania donovani complex. VL is a serious public health problem in rural India, causing high morbidity and mortality, as well as major costs to local and national health budgets. People at risk of VL are also at risk of other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) including soil transmitted helminths (worms). Intestinal worms are potent regulators of host immune responses often mediated through cross-talk with gut bacteria. Here we have used a modern DNA sequencing approach to determine the composition of microbiota in stool samples from VL cases and endemic controls. This allows us to determine all bacteria, as well as all single-celled and multicellular organisms, that comprise the microorganisms in the gut in a single sequencing experiment from a single stool sample. In addition to providing valuable information concerning commensal and pathogenic gut micro-organisms prevalent in this region of India, we find some specific associations between single-celled gut pathogens and VL case status.
   Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by Leishmania donovani remains of public health concern in rural India. Those at risk of VL are also at risk of other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) including soil transmitted helminths. Intestinal helminths are potent regulators of host immune responses sometimes mediated through cross-talk with gut microbiota. We evaluate a meta-taxonomic approach to determine the composition of prokaryotic and eukaryotic gut microflora using amplicon-based sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) and 18S rRNA gene regions. The most abundant bacterial taxa identified in faecal samples from Bihar State India were Prevotella (37.1%), Faecalibacterium (11.3%), Escherichia-Shigella (9.1%), Alloprevotella (4.5%), Bacteroides (4.1%), Ruminococcaceae UCG-002 (1.6%), and Bifidobacterium (1.5%). Eukaryotic taxa identified (excluding plant genera) included Blastocystis (57.9%; Order: Stramenopiles), Dientamoeba (12.1%; Family: Tritrichomonadea), Pentatrichomonas (10.1%; Family: Trichomonodea), Entamoeba (3.5%; Family: Entamoebida), Ascaridida (0.8%; Family: Chromodorea; concordant with Ascaris by microscopy), Rhabditida (0.8%; Family: Chromodorea; concordant with Strongyloides), and Cyclophyllidea (0.2%; Order: Eucestoda; concordant with Hymenolepis). Overall alpha (Shannon's, Faith's and Pielou's indices) and beta (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity statistic; weighted UniFrac distances) diversity of taxa did not differ significantly by age, sex, geographic subdistrict, or VL case (N = 23) versus endemic control (EC; N = 23) status. However, taxon-specific associations occurred: (i) Ruminococcaceae UCG- 014 and Gastranaerophilales_uncultured bacterium were enriched in EC compared to VL cases; (ii) Pentatrichomonas was more abundant in VL cases than in EC, whereas the reverse occurred for Entamoeba. Across the cohort, high Escherichia-Shigella was associated with reduced bacterial diversity, while high Blastocystis was associated with high bacterial diversity and low Escherichia-Shigella. Individuals with high Blastocystis had low Bacteroidaceae and high Clostridiales vadin BB60 whereas the reverse held true for low Blastocystis. This scoping study provides useful baseline data upon which to develop a broader analysis of pathogenic enteric microflora and their influence on gut microbial health and NTDs generally.

AB Lipophosphoglycan (LPG) is the major surface glycoconjugate of Leishmania protozoan and has an important biological role in host-parasite interactions both in the midgut epithelium of the sand fly vector and in the vertebrate macrophages. Canine leishmaniasis (CanL) is a chronic infectious disease predominantly caused by Leishmania infantum. An early and accurate immunodiagnosis of the disease is crucial for veterinary clinical practice and for disease control. In this work, we evaluated L. infantum LPG as an antigen in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for CanL immunodiagnosis (LPG-ELISA) by testing serum samples from 97 naturally infected dogs with diverse clinical presentations ranging from subclinical infection to severe disease, as evaluated by veterinarian infectologists. Serum samples from healthy dogs from non-endemic areas (n = 68) and from dogs with other infectious diseases (n = 64) were used as controls for assay validation. The performance of the LPG-ELISA was compared with that of an ELISA using the soluble fraction of L. infantum total lysate antigen (TLA). LPG-ELISA presented a superior performance in comparison to TLA-ELISA, with 91.5% sensitivity, 98.5% specificity and 99.7% accuracy. A distinguishing feature of the LPG-ELISA compared to the TLA-ELISA was its higher ability to identify subclinical infection in clinically healthy dogs, in addition to the absence of cross-reactivity with other canine infectious diseases. Finally, LPG-ELISA was compared to TR DPP visceral canine leishmaniasis test, the immunochromatographic test recommended by the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture. LPG-ELISA exhibited higher values of specificity (98.5% versus 93.1%) and sensitivity (91.5% versus 90.6%) compared to TR DPP. In conclusion, L. infantum-derived LPG was recognized by antibodies elicited during CanL in different infection stages and was shown to be a suitable antigen for specific clinical settings of veterinary diagnosis and for public health usage.
   Author summary Canine leishmaniasis (CanL) caused by Leishmania infantum is a zoonotic disease with high importance for the public health of several countries. L. infantum-infected dogs can be a domestic reservoir of the protozoan parasite for sand flies, which transmit it from dogs to humans during their blood meals. It is important to diagnose and treat infected dogs as early as possible, so the dissemination of CanL and the transmission to humans can be controlled. The currently commercially available assays present problems, such as cross-reaction with other canine diseases and lack of sensitivity in the detection of dogs that do not present clinical signs of disease. In this work, we tested lipophosphoglycan (LPG), a molecule abundantly found in the protozoan ' s surface, as an antigen in an immunodiagnostic platform. We were able to see that the assay using LPG is highly sensitive and specific, showed no cross-reaction with other canine infectious diseases and successfully identified infected dogs with no signs of disease.

AB Author summary Fascioliasis is a neglected zoonosis with major public health implications in humans. Triclabendazole (TCBZ) is the drug of choice, but alternative approved drugs are necessary in cases of TCBZ failure. Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is an alternative used in such cases. However, the efficacy of NTZ in TCBZ-failure cases among patients in Egypt remains unclear. In this study, the efficacy of NTZ was evaluated in cases of TCBZ failure during an outbreak of human fascioliasis in Assiut governorate of Upper Egypt. This study enrolled 67 patients diagnosed with fascioliasis based on clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings. These patients were referred from the outpatient clinic in Manfalout locality of Assiut governorate in Egypt. All patients received TCBZ at recommended doses as initial treatment. Those failing to respond were treated with NTZ at standard doses; following therapy, lesions in the liver and high eosinophil counts were resolved in 30% and 6.7% patients, respectively, indicating an overall efficacy of 36.6%. Therefore, in this outbreak of human fascioliasis in Upper Egypt, NTZ was found to be partially effective in cases with TCBZ failure.
   Background Fascioliasis is a neglected zoonosis with major public health implications in humans. Although triclabendazole (TCBZ) is the drug of choice, there are records of TCBZ failure worldwide. TCBZ-resistant fascioliasis is treated with alternative approved drugs including nitazoxanide (NTZ), with varying levels of efficacy. Data on NTZ efficacy after TCBZ failure in Egypt is scarce. This study evaluated the efficacy of NTZ in cases of TCBZ failure during an outbreak of fascioliasis in Assiut governorate of Upper Egypt. Methodology/Principal findings This prospective study included 67 patients from the outpatient clinic in Manfalout locality of Assiut governorate with clinical manifestations of acute fascioliasis. These included high eosinophilia (> 6% eosinophils in peripheral blood), positive anti-Fasciola antibodies, and hepatic focal lesions (HFL) or ascites on abdominal ultrasound or computed tomography. All patients initially received TCBZ at recommended doses. Patients were followed up after 1 month to assess response. According to the responses, patients were categorized as non-responders and responders. The non-responders received a trial of NTZ and were re-assessed for response based on clinical manifestations, eosinophil count, and abdominal ultrasound. Patients not responding to NTZ received additional doses of TCBZ. One month after initial TCBZ treatment, 37 patients responded well to TCBZ, while 30 patients failed to respond with persistence of fever, abdominal pain, high eosinophilia, and HFL. Most non-responders were male (56.7%); females predominated among TCBZ responders (62.2%). The mean age of the non-responders was relatively lower, at 20.57 +/- 14.47 years (p = 0.004). Following NTZ therapy, HFL disappeared in 9/30 (30%) patients and eosinophil counts normalized in only 2 (6.7%) patients, indicating an overall efficacy of 36.6%. The remaining cases received additional doses of TCBZ with complete clinical, pathological, and radiological resolution.

TI The costs of monitoring trachoma elimination: Impact, surveillance, and
   trachomatous trichiasis (TT)-only surveys
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
AB Background Although trachoma causes more cases of preventable blindness than any other infectious disease, a combination of strategies is reducing its global prevalence. As a district moves toward eliminating trachoma as a public health problem, national programs conduct trachoma impact surveys (TIS) to assess whether to stop preventative interventions and trachoma surveillance surveys (TSS) to determine whether the prevalence of active trachoma has rebounded after interventions have halted. In some contexts, programs also conduct trachomatous trichiasis (TT)-only surveys. A few costing studies of trachoma prevalence surveys exist, but none examine TIS, TSS, or TT-only surveys. Methodology/Principal findings We assessed the incremental financial cost to the national program of TIS, TSS, and TT-only surveys, which are standardized cluster-sampled prevalence surveys. We conducted a retrospective review of expenditures and grant disbursements for TIS and TSS in 322 evaluation units in 11 countries between 2011 and 2018. We also assessed the costs of three pilot and five standard TT-only surveys in four countries between 2017 and 2018. The median cost of TIS and TSS was $8,298 per evaluation unit [interquartile range (IQR): $6,532-$10,111, 2017 USD]. Based on a linear regression with bootstrapped confidence intervals, after controlling for country, costs per survey did not change significantly over time but did decline by $83 per survey implemented in a single round (95% CI: -$108 --$63). Of total costs, 80% went to survey fieldwork; of that, 58% went towards per diems and 38% towards travel. TT-only surveys cost a median of $9,707 (IQR: $8,537-$11,635); within a given country, they cost slightly more (106% [IQR: 94%-136%]) than TIS and TSS.
   Author summary The global health community is working to eliminate trachoma, a bacterial disease that causes blindness. The elimination strategy includes offering antibiotics to everyone living in communities with a high prevalence of active trachoma, also known as mass drug administration, and providing surgeries for people with advanced trachoma. The World Health Organization requires that countries conduct surveys to see whether a district has reached the prevalence benchmarks for stopping population-level prevention interventions against trachoma. After stopping these interventions, programs conduct more surveys to make sure that trachoma has remained at bay. Trachoma programs must include the costs of these surveys in their budgets. Although some estimates of the costs of baseline trachoma prevalence surveys already exist, none examine the costs of additional surveys required later in the program. In this paper, we analyze the costs of over 300 of these surveys. We find that they cost about $8,000-$10,000 per survey, varying widely by country. Variations are mostly driven by how much it costs to pay surveyors and transport them to survey sites. Costs did not appear to change over time. With the data that we present in this paper, national programs will be more prepared to plan for monitoring the elimination of trachoma.

TI Healthcare demand in response to rabies elimination campaigns in Latin

ID CANINE RABIES; VACCINATION
AB Author summary Several global health organizations have prioritized investment for global elimination of human death from canine rabies. Cost-effective deployment requires understanding complex connections between rabies risk and healthcare seeking behavior. During 1995-2005, there was a rapid decline in dog and human rabies cases in several Latin American countries following concerted investment in mass dog vaccinations and human post-exposure vaccination. Using data from this period, we econometrically estimate relationships between dog vaccinations, dog rabies cases, human exposure reports, human post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) use, and human rabies deaths. We estimate quantitatively how dog vaccinations indirectly reduce human rabies deaths, mediated through dog rabies cases, dog bite reporting, and PEP use. We find that reported human exposures decline as dog rabies cases decline, but these declines are offset by increases in reported exposures per dog rabies case, which may be driven by increased rabies awareness through anti-rabies campaigns. Furthermore, while PEP demand declines as dog rabies cases decline, increases in income and public health expenditures concurrently increase demand for PEP. These findings provide better understanding of the underlying factors driving PEP demand and exposure (under)reporting to inform cost-effective policy design to reduce unnecessary PEP prescription and false negatives leading to human death.
   The World Health Organization, the World Organization for Animal Health, and the Food and Agriculture Organization have resolved to eliminate human rabies deaths due to dog bites by 2030, and the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) has added human rabies vaccines to their investments for 2021-2025. Implementing these goals cost-effectively and sustainably requires understanding the complex connections between dog rabies vaccination and human risk and response. The objective of this paper is to estimate how dog rabies vaccinations affect human rabies deaths, mediated through dog rabies cases, dog bite reporting, and post-exposure human rabies vaccination. To approach this objective, we apply multivariate regression analysis over five rabies-related outcomes: (a) dog vaccinations, (b) dog rabies cases, (c) reported human exposures, (d) human post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) use, and (e) human rabies cases. Analysis uses aggregate annual data over 1995-2005 for seven Latin American countries that experienced dramatic declines in canine and human rabies. Among other results, we estimate the following. (i) A 10% increase in dog vaccinations decreases dog rabies cases by 2.3%. (ii) Reported exposures decline as concurrent dog rabies cases decline, but these declines are more than offset by increases in reported exposures per dog rabies case, which may result from higher rabies awareness due to anti-rabies campaigns. (iii) A 10% increase in PEP use decreases human deaths by 7%, but a 10% increase in dog vaccination induces a 2.8% decrease in PEP use. The net effect is that a 10% increase in dog vaccination reduces human deaths by 12.4% overall, although marginal effectiveness declines as dog rabies incidence declines. (iv) Increases in income and public health expenditures increase PEP demand. The findings highlight the importance of mass dog vaccination, heightened awareness, treatment access, and clinical algorithms to reduce both false negatives leading to death and false positives leading to costly unnecessary PEP prescriptions.

TI Prevalence and environmental determinants of cutaneous leishmaniasis in
   rural communities in Tigray, northern Ethiopia
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES

DT Article
ID EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Author summary Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a skin infection, transmitted by sandflies. It is most common in Ethiopia, but so far only a few hundred people have received treatment. Five rural villages in Tigray Region, in the north of Ethiopia, were visited to assess the status and determinants of CL. In a door-to-door survey 9,622 residents of 1,721 households were examined and interviewed. A total of 222 had active lesions, an average prevalence of 2.3% CL. Children (up to 9 years old) and teenagers (age 10-19) were more affected than other groups. Most active lesions were found in the face and on arms. Almost 11% of the households had one or more cases of CL and this was associated with proximity to habitats of hyrax, intermediate hosts of the disease. A total of 2009 people (20.9%) showed scars from earlier infections. The findings show how widespread the disease is in the north of Ethiopia and provide some first insights into the environmental factors that influence transmission.
   Background In Ethiopia guidelines for diagnoses and treatment of leishmaniases are available, but only a few hundred people are diagnosed and receive treatment. A field study has been carried out to determine the status and environmental determinants of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and assess the degree of awareness of the rural communities in affected areas in Tigray, northern Ethiopia. Methodology / Principal findings Following a reconnaissance survey that identified endemic foci, a cross sectional door-to-door survey was conducted in 2009 in five rural communities around the towns of Adigrat and Hagereselam in Tigray. In total 9,622 residents of 1,721 households were clinically screened and household heads interviewed regarding the determinants of infection. The chi(2) test and logistic regression were used to determine differences in prevalence between localities, age and sex, and to identify environmental determinants of infection. The overall prevalence of localized CL was 2.3% (highest 4.7%), with marked inter-village differences. Another 20.9% had scars from previous infections. While risk was sex-independent, prevalence was significantly higher in the 0-9 (4.5%) and 10-19 (2.5%) age groups and predominantly involved the face (82.1%) and upper limbs (13.1%). Nearly 11% of the households had one or more cases of CL and this was associated with proximity to hyrax habitats. All interviewees were knowledgeable about the lesions but ignorant of the disease's mode of transmission and its association with hyraxes. Conclusions The study established that CL is an important public health problem in the study communities, and has been so for a while, as demonstrated by the widespread presence of scars. CL in Tigray appeared to be predominantly of zoonotic nature, mainly transmitted in peri-domestic habitats in proximity to hyrax habitats. Integrated interventions, including awareness creation, are highly recommended.

   DETERMINISM; DISPERSAL; MODEL
AB A key question in ecology is the relative impact of internal nonlinear dynamics and external perturbations on the long-term trajectories of natural systems. Measles has been analyzed extensively as a paradigm for consumer-resource dynamics due to the oscillatory nature of the host-pathogen life cycle, the abundance of rich data to test theory, and public health relevance. The dynamics of measles in London, in particular, has acted as a prototypical test bed for such analysis using incidence data from the pre-vaccination era (1944-1967). However, during this timeframe there were few external large-scale perturbations, limiting an assessment of the relative impact of internal and extra demographic perturbations to the host population. Here, we extended the previous London analyses to include nearly a century of data that also contains four major demographic changes: the First and Second World Wars, the 1918 influenza pandemic, and the start of a measles mass vaccination program. By combining mortality and incidence data using particle filtering methods, we show that a simple stochastic epidemic model, with minimal historical specifications, can capture the nearly 100 years of dynamics including changes caused by each of the major perturbations. We show that the majority of dynamic changes are explainable by the internal nonlinear dynamics of the system, tuned by demographic changes. In addition, the 1918 influenza pandemic and World War II acted as extra perturbations to this basic epidemic oscillator. Our analysis underlines that long-term ecological and epidemiological dynamics can follow very simple rules, even in a non-stationary population subject to significant perturbations and major secular changes.

TI Optimizing spatial allocation of seasonal influenza vaccine under

SO PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY

DT Article
ID VENTILATORS; STRATEGIES
AB Prophylactic interventions such as vaccine allocation are some of the most effective public health policy planning tools. The supply of vaccines, however, is limited and an important challenge is to optimally allocate the vaccines to minimize epidemic impact. This resource allocation question (which we refer to as VaccIntDesign) has multiple dimensions: when, where, to whom, etc. Most of the existing literature in this topic deals with the latter (to whom), proposing policies that prioritize individuals by age and disease risk. However, since seasonal influenza spread has a typical spatial trend, and due to the temporal constraints enforced by the availability schedule, the when and where problems become equally, if not more, relevant. In this paper, we study the VaccIntDesign problem in the context of seasonal influenza spread in the United States. We develop a national scale metapopulation model for influenza that integrates both short and long distance human mobility, along with realistic data on vaccine uptake. We also design GreedyAlloc, a greedy algorithm for allocating the vaccine supply at the state level under temporal constraints and show that such a strategy improves over the current baseline of pro-rata allocation, and the improvement is more pronounced for higher vaccine efficacy and moderate flu season intensity. Further, the resulting strategy resembles a ring vaccination applied spatiallyacross the US.

AB Author summaryWhy was this study done? The approval of new pharmaceutical products addressing an unmet need or of public interest may be speeded up if medicines regulators agree to assess them through expedited assessment pathways. Pharmaceutical product development may be speeded up by using surrogate (substitute) endpoints (for example, based on a blood test or a radiological change) to measure benefit in the pivotal (main) trials assessed by regulators rather than waiting on the intended clinical outcome (benefits in how patients feel, function, or how long they survive). It is not known how often regulatory approval is based on a surrogate endpoint instead of a clinical outcome. It is not known how accurately the surrogate endpoints used in pivotal trials correspond to improvement in clinical outcomes. What did the researchers do and find? We examined endpoints supporting regulatory approval of products assessed through 2 expedited assessment pathways, conditional marketing authorisation (CMA; 26 products) and accelerated assessment (AA; 25 products) by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) between 2011 and 2018. Where surrogate endpoints were used, we searched the academic literature for studies demonstrating that the surrogate reliably reflected a clinical outcome. Most of the expedited approvals studied (46/51; 90%) were based on surrogate endpoints, and none of these has (yet) been shown to reliably predict clinical outcomes. The information provided by the regulator for prescribers and patients did not consistently explain that the approval for the product was based on trials that reported surrogate endpoints rather than clinical outcomes. What do these findings mean? For the majority of the products studied, we do not know whether they will provide their intended clinical benefit for patients. When nonvalidated surrogate endpoints are used in pivotal trials, a requirement for additional studies confirming the clinical benefit to patients needs to be imposed by the regulator on the manufacturing authorisation holder responsible for the product. It would be of great help for patients and doctors if the product information provided by the regulator clearly stated whether surrogate endpoints or actual clinical outcomes were reported in the pivotal trial/s for the product, the validity of a surrogate endpoint (when used) as a reflection of the intended clinical outcome, and whether follow-up studies demonstrating clinical benefit were required for products approved on the basis of surrogate endpoints in the pivotal trials. A limitation of our study is that it applies to products approved through 2 expedited pathways; we do not know to what extent other types of regulatory approval are based on surrogate endpoints.
   Background In situations of unmet medical need or in the interests of public health, expedited approval pathways, including conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) and accelerated assessment (AA), speed up European Medicines Agency (EMA) marketing authorisation recommendations for medicinal products. CMAs are based on incomplete benefit-risk assessment data and authorisation remains conditional until regulator-imposed confirmatory postmarketing measures are fulfilled. For products undergoing AA, complete safety and efficacy data should be available, and postauthorisation measures may include only standard requirements of risk management and pharmacovigilance plans. In the pivotal trials supporting products assessed by expedited pathways, surrogate endpoints reduce drug development time compared with waiting for the intended clinical outcomes. Whether surrogate endpoints supporting products authorised through CMA and AA pathways reliably predict clinical benefits of therapy has not been studied systematically. Our objectives were to determine the extent to which surrogate endpoints are used and to assess whether their validity had been confirmed according to published hierarchies. Methods and findings We used European Public Assessment Reports (EPARs) to identify the primary endpoints in the pivotal trials supporting products authorised through CMA or AA pathways during January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2018. We excluded products that were vaccines, topical, reversal, or bleeding prophylactic agents or withdrawn within the study time frame. Where pivotal trials reported surrogate endpoints, we conducted PubMed searches for evidence of validity for predicting clinical outcomes. We used 2 published hierarchies to assess validity level. Surrogates with randomised controlled trials supporting the surrogate-clinical outcome relationship were rated as 'validated'. Fifty-one products met the inclusion criteria; 26 underwent CMAs, and 25 underwent AAs. Overall, 26 products were for oncology indications, 10 for infections, 8 for genetic disorders, and 7 for other systems disorders. Five products (10%), all AAs, were authorised based on pivotal trials reporting clinical outcomes, and 46 (90%) were authorised based on surrogate endpoints. No studies were identified that validated the surrogate endpoints. Among a total of 49 products with surrogate endpoints reported, most were rated according to the published hierarchies as being 'reasonably likely' (n = 30; 61%) or of having 'biological plausibility' (n = 46; 94%) to predict clinical outcomes. EPARs did not consistently explain the nature of the pivotal trial endpoints supporting authorisations, whether surrogate endpoints were validated or not, or describe the endpoints to be reported in the confirmatory postmarketing studies. Our study has limitations: we may have overlooked relevant validation studies; the findings apply to 2 expedited pathways and may not be generalisable to products authorised through the standard assessment pathway. Conclusions The pivotal trial evidence supporting marketing authorisations for products granted CMA or AA was based dominantly on nonvalidated surrogate endpoints. EPARs and summary product characteristic documents, including patient information leaflets, need to state consistently the nature and limitations of endpoints in pivotal trials supporting expedited authorisations so that prescribers and patients appreciate shortcomings in the evidence about actual clinical benefit.
   For products supported by nonvalidated surrogate endpoints, postauthorisation measures to confirm clinical benefit need to be imposed by the regulator on the marketing authorisation holders.

AB Background There has been a growing interest in understanding the effects of social networks on health-related behaviour, with a particular backdrop being the emerging prominence of complexity or systems science in public health. Social network interventions specifically use or alter the characteristics of social networks to generate, accelerate, or maintain health behaviours. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate health behaviour outcomes of social network interventions. Methods and findings We searched eight databases and two trial registries from 1990 to May 28, 2019, for English-language reports of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and before-and-after studies investigating social network interventions for health behaviours and outcomes. Trials that did not specifically use social networks or that did not include a comparator group were excluded. We screened studies and extracted data from published reports independently. The primary outcome of health behaviours or outcomes at <= 6 months was assessed by random-effects meta-analysis. Secondary outcomes included those measures at >6-12 months and >12 months. This study is registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, PROSPERO: CRD42015023541. We identified 26,503 reports; after exclusion, 37 studies, conducted between 1996 and 2018 from 11 countries, were eligible for analysis, with a total of 53,891 participants (mean age 32.4 years [SD 12.7]; 45.5% females). A range of study designs were included: 27 used RCT/cluster RCT designs, and 10 used other study designs. Eligible studies addressed a variety of health outcomes, in particular sexual health and substance use. Social network interventions showed a significant intervention effect compared with comparator groups for sexual health outcomes. The pooled odds ratio (OR) was 1.46 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-2.11; I-2 = 76%) for sexual health outcomes at <= 6 months and OR 1.51 (95% CI 1.27-1.81; I-2 = 40%) for sexual health outcomes at >6-12 months. Intervention effects for drug risk outcomes at each time point were not significant. There were also significant intervention effects for some other health outcomes including alcohol misuse, well-being, change in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and smoking cessation. Because of clinical and measurement heterogeneity, it was not appropriate to pool data on these other behaviours in a meta-analysis. For sexual health outcomes, prespecified subgroup analyses were significant for intervention approach (p < 0.001), mean age of participants (p = 0.002), and intervention length (p = 0.05). Overall, 22 of the 37 studies demonstrated a high risk of bias, as measured by the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. The main study limitations identified were the inclusion of studies of variable quality; difficulty in isolating the effects of specific social network intervention components on health outcomes, as interventions included other active components; and reliance on self-reported outcomes, which have inherent recall and desirability biases. Conclusions Our findings suggest that social network interventions can be effective in the short term (<6 months) and longer term (>6 months) for sexual health outcomes. Intervention effects for drug risk outcomes at each time point were not significant. There were also significant intervention effects for some other health outcomes including alcohol misuse, well-being, change in HbA1c, and smoking cessation.
   Author summaryWhy was this study done? Social network interventions specifically use or alter the characteristics of social networks to generate, accelerate, or maintain health behaviours and positive health outcomes. Results from previous systematic reviews provided some evidence that social network interventions were effective for improving social support and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) outcomes; however, the few studies identified had a high risk of bias. The optimal way to apply social network intervention approaches to various health interventions remains unknown. What did the researchers do and find? We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses of 37 studies investigating the effectiveness of social network interventions for health behaviours and outcomes (or their surrogates). Our findings show a significant effect of social network interventions for a range of health behaviours and outcomes, in particular for sexual health outcomes, both in the short and longer term. Subgroup analyses were significant for the intervention approach and when trials were grouped on the basis of mean age and percentage of females. In total, 22 out of the 37 studies identified had a high risk of bias, and included studies employed different study designs of variable quality. What do these findings mean? Evidence from this study suggests that social network interventions are associated with positive health behaviours and outcomes. Researchers and public health practitioners should consider how to use the social networks of their populations when delivering health behaviour interventions in order to maximise effectiveness. We recommend that the scientific community should move beyond individual-level approaches to design and test interventions that use the largely untapped potential of social networks to improve health behaviours and outcomes.

ID HIV-1 PREVENTION; CONTRACEPTIVES; PROVISION; WORKERS
AB Author summaryWhy was this study done? Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in Africa are disproportionately affected by HIV infections because of cultural, structural, biological, and behavior factors. Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), as a highly potent and recommended discreet user-controlled HIV prevention strategy, has the potential to substantially reduce new HIV infections in African women if delivered with high coverage and if used with sufficient adherence. However, data are limited on "real-world" implementation approaches to efficiently reach at-risk women who may benefit from PrEP. Family planning (FP) clinics provide care to young women at risk for acquiring HIV and have in-built staffing, supply chain, and HIV testing access, which could contribute to more efficient PrEP implementation with less cost, but no study has evaluated this model in "real-world" settings. What did the researchers do and find? We conducted a pilot open-label, "real-world" implementation program to evaluate the feasibility of integrating PrEP delivery into routine FP clinics to reach HIV at-risk young women. General-population women accessing FP services were universally screened for HIV behavior risk factors and were counseled for PrEP by program-dedicated nurses embedded in 8 public health FP clinics in a high-HIV-prevalence region in Kenya. We found that FP clinics can be an effective platform to efficiently reach HIV at-risk women who may benefit from PrEP. PrEP screening was feasible, and 22% of the general population of women took PrEP home. There was a high drop-off in early PrEP continuation (41% PrEP continuation at 1 month) particularly among AGYW <24 years old, but a subset of women persisted on PrEP (25% at month 3 and 15% at month 6), with higher continuation among women with HIV-positive partners, possibly indicating further reflection or decision-making on PrEP use. Women's perceived risk for HIV, including having an HIV-positive partner, was an important driver of initiation and continuation on PrEP. What do these findings mean? To our knowledge, this project provides the first demonstration of "real-world" delivery of PrEP for at-risk AGYW integrated into FP clinics in Africa, a priority population for HIV prevention. These findings demonstrate that it may be feasible to integrate PrEP delivery in public health FP clinics, making this a platform potential "one-stop" location for FP and PrEP. With expanding PrEP awareness, uptake and continuation are likely to increase among women at risk. Evidence from this work will inform next steps for wider delivery of PrEP and next-generation PrEP formulations (e.g., multipurpose HIV prevention and contraception technologies) in FP clinics, not only in Kenya but in other resource-limited settings globally.
   Background Young women account for a disproportionate fraction of new HIV infections in Africa and are a priority population for HIV prevention, including implementation of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The overarching goal of this project was to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating PrEP delivery within routine family planning (FP) clinics to serve as a platform to efficiently reach at-risk adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) for PrEP in HIV high-burden settings. Methods and findings The PrEP Implementation in Young Women and Adolescents (PrIYA) program is a real-world implementation program to demonstrate integration of PrEP delivery for at-risk AGYW in FP clinics in Kisumu, Kenya. Between November 2017 and June 2018, women aged 15 to 45 from the general population seeking FP services at 8 public health clinics were universally screened for HIV behavioral risk factors and offered PrEP following national PrEP guidelines. We evaluated PrEP uptake and continuation, and robust Poisson regression methods were used to identify correlates of uptake and early continuation of PrEP, with age included as a one-knot linear spline. Overall, 1,271 HIV-uninfected women accessing routine FP clinics were screened for PrEP; the median age was 25 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 22-29), 627 (49%) were <24 years old, 1,026 (82%) were married, more than one-third (34%) had partners of unknown HIV status, and the vast majority (n = 1,200 [94%]) reported recent condom-less sex. Of 1,271 women screened, 278 (22%) initiated PrEP, and 114 (41%) returned for at least one refill visit after initiation. PrEP uptake was independently associated with reported male-partner HIV status (HIV-positive 94%, unknown 35%, HIV-negative 8%; p < 0.001) and marital status (28% unmarried versus married 21%; p = 0.04), and a higher proportion of women >= 24 years (26%; 191/740) initiated PrEP compared to 16% (87/531) of young women <24 years (p < 0.001). There was a moderate and statistically non-significant unadjusted increase in PrEP uptake among women using oral contraception pills (OCPs) compared to women using injectable or long-acting reversible contraception methods (OCP 28% versus injectable/implants/intrauterine devices [IUDs] 18%; p = 0.06). Among women with at least one post-PrEP initiation follow-up visit (n = 278), no HIV infection was documented during the project period. Overall, continuation of PrEP use at 1, 3, and 6 months post initiation was 41%, 24%, and 15%, respectively. The likelihood for early continuation of PrEP use (i.e., return for at least one PrEP refill within 45 days post initiation) was strongly associated with reported male-partner HIV status (HIV-positive 67%, -negative 39%, unknown 31%; overall effect p = 0.001), and a higher proportion of women >= 24 years old continued PrEP at 1 month compared with young women <24 years old (47% versus 29%; p = 0.002). For women >= 24 years old, the likelihood to continue PrEP use at 1 month post initiation increased by 3% for each additional year of a woman's age (adjusted prevalence ratio [PR]: 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.05; p = 0.01). In contrast, for women <24 years old, the likelihood of continuing PrEP for each additional year of a woman's age was high in magnitude (approximately 6%) but statistically non-significant (adjusted PR: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.97-1.16; p = 0.18). Frequently reported reasons for discontinuing PrEP were low perceived risk of HIV (25%), knowledge that partner was HIV negative (24%), experiencing side effects (20%), and pill burden (17%).
   Study limitations include lack of qualitative work to provide insights into women's decision-making on PrEP uptake and continuation, the small number of measured covariates imposed by the program data, and a nonrandomized design limiting definitive ascertainment of the robustness of a PrEP-dedicated nurse-led implementation strategy. Conclusions In this real-world PrEP implementation program in Kenya, integration of universal screening and counseling for PrEP in FP clinics was feasible, making this platform a potential "one-stop" location for FP and PrEP. There was a high drop-off in PrEP continuation, but a subset of women continued PrEP use at least through 1 month, possibly indicating further reflection or decision-making on PrEP use. Greater efforts to support PrEP normalization and persistence for African women are needed to help women navigate their decisions about HIV prevention preferences as their reproductive goals and HIV vulnerability evolve.

AB Background Unfavorable psychosocial working conditions have been associated with cognitive decline and chronic diseases, both of which may subsequently accelerate functional dependence. This study aimed to investigate the association between job demand-control-support combinations and trajectories of disability in later life and to further explore the role of cognitive decline and the co-occurrence of chronic diseases in mediating this association. Methods and findings In this cohort study, 2,937 community dwellers aged 60+ years (mean age 73 +/- 10.6; 62.9% female) residing in the Kungsholmen District of Stockholm, Sweden, participated in the baseline survey (2001-2004) and were followed up to 12 years. Lifelong occupational history was obtained through a standardized interview; job demands, job control, and social support at work in the longest-held occupation were graded with a psychosocial job-exposure matrix. Job control, demands, and social support were dichotomized using the median values from the matrix, respectively, to further generate demand-control-support combinations. Disability was measured by summing the number of impaired basic and instrumental activities of daily living. Global cognitive function was assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination. Chronic conditions were ascertained by clinical examinations, medical history, and patient clinical records; the total number of chronic diseases was summed. Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models and mediation analysis. Age, sex, education, alcohol consumption, smoking, leisure activity engagement, early-life socioeconomic status, occupational characteristic and physical demands, and baseline cognitive function and number of chronic diseases were adjusted for in the analyses. Compared with active jobs (high control/high demands; n = 1,807), high strain (low control/high demands; n = 328), low strain (high control/low demands; n = 495), and passive jobs (low control/low demands; n = 307) were all associated with a faster rate of disability progression (beta = 0.07, 95% CI 0.02-0.13, p = 0.01; beta = 0.10, 95% CI 0.06-0.15, p < 0.001; beta = 0.11, 95% CI 0.05-0.18, p < 0.001). The association between high strain and disability progression was only shown in people with low social support at work (beta = 0.13, 95% CI 0.07-0.19, p < 0.001), but not in those with high social support (beta = 0.004, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.10, p = 0.93). Moreover, we estimated that the association between demand-control status and disability trajectories was mediated 38.5% by cognitive decline and 18.4% by accumulation of chronic diseases during the follow-up period. The limitations of this study include unmeasured confounding, self-reported work experience, and the reliance on a psychosocial job-exposure matrix that does not consider variabilities in individuals' perception on working conditions or job characteristics within occupations. Conclusions Our findings suggest that negative psychosocial working conditions during working life may accelerate disability progression in later life. Notably, social support at work may buffer the detrimental effect of high strain on disability progression. Cognitive decline and chronic-disease accumulation, and especially the former, partially mediate the association of psychosocial working conditions with trajectories of disability. Further studies are required to explore more mechanisms that underlie the association between psychosocial working conditions and disability trajectories.
   Author summaryWhy was this study done? Work is one of the activities that take up a considerable amount of time in our adult lives, thus potentially making it an important determinant of health, even in later life. Inability to independently carry out daily tasks (defined as disability) can affect older people's quality of life and pose a burden on caregivers and societies. A better understanding of the pathway between midlife working conditions and late-life disability may help the development of preventive strategies. What did the researchers do and find? We studied the association of psychosocial working conditions with the rate of disability progression over 12 years in a cohort of 2,937 individuals aged 60 years and older. We found that unfavorable psychosocial working conditions, including high-strain, low-strain, and passive jobs, were related to a faster rate of disability progression. The association of high-strain jobs with accelerated disability accumulation was only present among people with low social support at work. The decrement in cognitive function and increase in chronic-disease burden, and especially the former, partially explained the relationship between unfavorable working conditions and disability progression in later life. What do these findings mean? Unfavorable psychosocial working conditions during working life are related to the progression of disability in later life. Public health authorities, employers, and employees should all be aware of that. Social support at work is especially important in a high-strain work environment given its capacity to attenuate the impact of high-strain jobs on disability accumulation. Monitoring cognitive function and medical conditions of people with unfavorable working conditions is endorsed by the role of both dimensions, and especially of cognitive dysfunction, in accelerating disability progression in older age.

AB Background Mental illness stigma is a fundamental barrier to improving mental health worldwide, but little is known about how to durably reduce it. Understanding of mental illness as a treatable medical condition may influence stigmatizing beliefs, but available evidence to inform this hypothesis has been derived solely from high-income countries. We embedded a randomized survey experiment within a whole-population cohort study in rural southwestern Uganda to assess the extent to which portrayals of mental illness treatment effectiveness influence personal beliefs and perceived norms about mental illness and about persons with mental illness. Methods and findings Study participants were randomly assigned to receive a vignette describing a typical woman (control condition) or one of nine variants describing a different symptom presentation (suggestive of schizophrenia, bipolar, or major depression) and treatment course (no treatment, treatment with remission, or treatment with remission followed by subsequent relapse). Participants then answered questions about personal beliefs and perceived norms in three domains of stigma: willingness to have the woman marry into their family, belief that she is receiving divine punishment, and belief that she brings shame on her family. We used multivariable Poisson and ordered logit regression models to estimate the causal effect of vignette treatment assignment on each stigma-related outcome. Of the participants randomized, 1,355 were successfully interviewed (76%) from November 2016 to June 2018. Roughly half of respondents were women (56%), half had completed primary school (57%), and two-thirds were married or cohabiting (64%). The mean age was 42 years. Across all types of mental illness and treatment scenarios, relative to the control vignette (22%-30%), substantially more study participants believed the woman in the vignette was receiving divine punishment (31%-54%) or believed she brought shame on her family (51%-73%), and most were unwilling to have her marry into their families (80%-88%). In multivariable Poisson regression models, vignette portrayals of untreated mental illness, relative to the control condition, increased the risk that study participants endorsed stigmatizing personal beliefs about mental illness and about persons with mental illness, irrespective of mental illness type (adjusted risk ratios [ARRs] varied from 1.7-3.1, all p < 0.001). Portrayals of effectively treated mental illness or treatment followed by subsequent relapse also increased the risk of responses indicating stigmatizing personal beliefs relative to control (ARRs varied from 1.5-3.0, all p < 0.001). The magnitudes of the estimates suggested that portrayals of initially effective treatment (whether followed by relapse or not) had little moderating influence on stigmatizing responses relative to vignettes portraying untreated mental illness. Responses to questions about perceived norms followed similar patterns. The primary limitations of this study are that the vignettes may have omitted context that could have influenced stigma and that generalizability beyond rural Uganda may be limited. Conclusions In a population-based, randomized survey experiment conducted in rural southwestern Uganda, portrayals of effectively treated mental illness did not appear to reduce endorsement of stigmatizing beliefs about mental illness or about persons with mental illness. These findings run counter to evidence from the United States.
   Further research is necessary to understand the relationship between mental illness treatment and stigmatizing attitudes in Uganda and other countries worldwide.

AB Background Civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems play a key role in upholding human rights and generating data for health and good governance. They also can help monitor progress in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Although many countries have made substantial progress in strengthening their CRVS systems, most low- and middle-income countries still have underdeveloped systems. The objective of this systematic review is to identify national policies that can help countries strengthen their systems. Methods and findings The ABI/INFORM, Embase, JSTOR, PubMed, and WHO Index Medicus databases were systematically searched for policies to improve birth and/or death registration on 24 January 2017. Global stakeholders were also contacted for relevant grey literature. For the purposes of this review, policies were categorised as supply, demand, incentive, penalty, or combination (i.e., at least two of the preceding policy approaches). Quantitative results on changes in vital event registration rates were presented for individual comparative articles. Qualitative systematic review methodology, including meta-ethnography, was used for qualitative syntheses on operational considerations encompassing acceptability to recipients and staff, human resource requirements, information technology or infrastructure requirements, costs to the health system, unintended effects, facilitators, and barriers. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018085768. Thirty-five articles documenting experience in implementing policies to improve birth and/or death registration were identified. Although 25 countries representing all global regions (Africa, the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Western Pacific, Europe, and the Eastern Mediterranean) were reflected, there were limited countries from the Eastern Mediterranean and Europe regions. Twenty-four articles reported policy effects on birth and/or death registration. Twenty-one of the 24 articles found that the change in registration rate after the policy was positive, with two supply and one penalty articles being the exceptions. The qualitative syntheses identified 15 operational considerations across all policy categories. Human and financial resource requirements were not quantified. The primary limitation of this systematic review was the threat of publication bias wherein many countries may not have documented their experience; this threat is most concerning for policies that had neutral or negative effects. Conclusions Our systematic review suggests that combination policy approaches, consisting of at least a supply and demand component, were consistently associated with improved registration rates in different geographical contexts. Operational considerations should be interpreted based on health system, governance, and sociocultural context. More evaluations and research are needed from the Eastern Mediterranean and Europe regions. Further research and evaluation are also needed to estimate the human and financial resource requirements required for different policies.
   Author summaryWhy was this study done? Civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems generate foundational data for governance across sectors. Within public health, birth and death registrations are critical not only for empowering individuals' legal rights and for access to services but also in estimating health service needs, coverage, and impact. To our knowledge, no formal evidence review and synthesis has characterised which policies work and which do not for strengthening birth and death registration. What did the researchers do and find? We searched five literature databases and contacted global stakeholders to identify policies that improve birth and/or death registration and presented policy quantitative effects and qualitative syntheses. We identified 35 articles documenting experience in implementing policies to improve birth and/or death registration from 25 countries representing all global regions. Twenty-four articles reported supply, demand, incentive, penalty, or combination (i.e., at least two of the preceding policy approaches) effects on birth and/or death registration. Combination policy approaches, consisting of at least a supply and demand component, were consistently associated with improved registration rates across different geographical contexts. What do these findings mean? Countries interested in strengthening their CRVS systems may need to consider a combination of multiple policy approaches based on their health system, governance, and sociocultural context. Although this review and synthesis successfully identified many quantitative and qualitative data to strengthen CRVS systems, more policy evaluations and research are needed on effects from the Eastern Mediterranean and Europe regions and on human and financial resource requirements globally. Publication bias may have led investigators with neutral or negative findings to not document their findings; further research and evaluation is needed to understand which policies do not work.

AB Author summary Viruses transmitted by mosquitoes have recently received huge attention from the media because the epidemics caused by Zika and chikungunya virus rapidly spread to new areas and infected a large number of individuals. Mayaro is a virus transmitted by mosquitoes that circulates in the Caribbean and tropical regions of Latin America. It causes a highly inflammatory disease, called Mayaro fever, and acute disease is often followed by a prolonged arthralgia mediated by chronic inflammation that can last months or years. The spread of Mayaro to urban areas is a major concern by the authorities, given that the virus has potential to cause an epidemic if spread in high-risk areas. Thus, understanding the mechanisms related to the pathogenesis of this infectious agent would be of great value to treat and prevent the disease. Here, we established an adult mouse model of Mayaro infection and demonstrated that the virus activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is important to regulate this viral disease. Our study provides molecular targets for a future treatment of Mayaro fever and provides an experimental model to understand the pathology caused by this emerging viral pathogen.
   Mayaro virus (MAYV) is an arbovirus that circulates in Latin America and is emerging as a potential threat to public health. Infected individuals develop Mayaro fever, a severe inflammatory disease characterized by high fever, rash, arthralgia, myalgia and headache. The disease is often associated with a prolonged arthralgia mediated by a chronic inflammation that can last months. Although the immune response against other arboviruses, such as chikungunya virus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), has been extensively studied, little is known about the pathogenesis of MAYV infection. In this study, we established models of MAYV infection in macrophages and in mice and found that MAYV can replicate in bone marrow-derived macrophages and robustly induce expression of inflammasome proteins, such as NLRP3, ASC, AIM2, and Caspase-1 (CASP1). Infection performed in macrophages derived from Nlrp3(-/-), Aim2(-/-), Asc(-/-)and Casp1/11(-/-)mice indicate that the NLRP3, but not AIM2 inflammasome is essential for production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 beta. We also determined that MAYV triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and potassium efflux. In vivo infections performed in inflammasome-deficient mice indicate that NLRP3 is involved with footpad swelling, inflammation and pain, establishing a role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the MAYV pathogenesis. Accordingly, we detected higher levels of caspase1-p20, IL-1 beta and IL-18 in the serum of MAYV-infected patients as compared to healthy individuals, supporting the participation of the NLRP3-inflammasome during MAYV infection in humans.

TI Deciphering the interplay between the genotoxic and probiotic activities

AB Author summary Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) has been used as a probiotic for over a century. However, it produces the genotoxin colibactin, which has been linked to the virulence of certain E. coli strains and could promote colorectal cancer. Administering a potentially pro-carcinogenic strain as a probiotic raises public health concerns. Therefore, our aim was to separate EcN genotoxic activity from its antagonistic effect, one of the most distinctive features of the probiotic property of EcN. We demonstrated that the microcin activity of EcN requires ClbP, an enzyme essential for colibactin production, and another enzyme involved in the synthesis of the siderophore salmochelin. This interplay was found in other E. coli strains, mainly isolated from urine. Therefore, E. coli strains utilize determinants from three distinct metabolic pathways to synthesize siderophore-microcins. Interestingly, the ClbP peptidase activity mandatory for colibactin production, has no role in siderophore-microcin activity, which provides a way to construct a non-genotoxic strain that retains its antibacterial activity. This intricate interplay between probiotic and pathogenic determinants confirms that biosynthetic pathways should be studied at the level of protein domains rather than that of whole proteins.
   Although Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) has been used therapeutically for over a century, the determinants of its probiotic properties remain elusive. EcN produces two siderophore-microcins (Mcc) responsible for an antagonistic activity against other Enterobacteriaceae. EcN also synthesizes the genotoxin colibactin encoded by the pks island. Colibactin is a virulence factor and a putative pro-carcinogenic compound. Therefore, we aimed to decouple the antagonistic activity of EcN from its genotoxic activity. We demonstrated that the pks-encoded ClbP, the peptidase that activates colibactin, is required for the antagonistic activity of EcN. The analysis of a series of ClbP mutants revealed that this activity is linked to the transmembrane helices of ClbP and not the periplasmic peptidase domain, indicating the transmembrane domain is involved in some aspect of Mcc biosynthesis or secretion. A single amino acid substitution in ClbP inactivates the genotoxic activity but maintains the antagonistic activity. In an in vivo salmonellosis model, this point mutant reduced the clinical signs and the fecal shedding of Salmonella similarly to the wild type strain, whereas the clbP deletion mutant could neither protect nor outcompete the pathogen. The ClbP-dependent antibacterial effect was also observed in vitro with other E. coli strains that carry both a truncated form of the Mcc gene cluster and the pks island. In such strains, siderophore-Mcc synthesis also required the glucosyltransferase IroB involved in salmochelin production. This interplay between colibactin, salmochelin, and siderophore-Mcc biosynthetic pathways suggests that these genomic islands were co-selected and played a role in the evolution of E. coli from phylogroup B2. This co-evolution observed in EcN illustrates the fine margin between pathogenicity and probiotic activity, and the need to address both the effectiveness and safety of probiotics. Decoupling the antagonistic from the genotoxic activity by specifically inactivating ClbP peptidase domain opens the way to the safe use of EcN.

ID SEXUAL TRANSMISSION; MARBURG-VIRUS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PATHOGENESIS; KIKWIT
AB Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is the most medically important tick-borne viral disease of humans and tuberculosis is the leading cause of death worldwide by a bacterial pathogen. These two diseases overlap geographically, however, concurrent infection of CCHF virus (CCHFV) with mycobacterial infection has not been assessed nor has the ability of virus to persist and cause long-term sequela in a primate model. In this study, we compared the disease progression of two diverse strains of CCHFV in the recently described cynomolgus macaque model. All animals demonstrated signs of clinical illness, viremia, significant changes in clinical chemistry and hematology values, and serum cytokine profiles consistent with CCHF in humans. The European and Asian CCHFV strains caused very similar disease profiles in monkeys, which demonstrates that medical countermeasures can be evaluated in this animal model against multiple CCHFV strains. We identified evidence of CCHFV persistence in the testes of three male monkeys that survived infection. Furthermore, the histopathology unexpectedly revealed that six additional animals had evidence of a latent mycobacterial infection with granulomatous lesions. Interestingly, CCHFV persisted within the granulomas of two animals. This study is the first to demonstrate the persistence of CCHFV in the testes and within the granulomas of non-human primates with concurrent latent tuberculosis. Our results have important public health implications in overlapping endemic regions for these emerging pathogens.
   Author summary CCHF is an emerging tick-borne viral disease that is endemic across much of Africa and Asia, and parts of Europe where its range and exposure risk to human populations is expanding. Tuberculosis threatens millions of lives world-wide and is the leading cause of death due to a bacterial pathogen. Concurrent mycobacterial infection with other infectious diseases has been described, but not for CCHFV despite the geographic overlap of these two pathogens. During our study we unexpectedly determined that some of the animals had latent tuberculosis and that CCHFV can persist within the granulomas. Furthermore, our study provides the first direct evidence that CCHFV can replicate and persist in the male genital tract, which has important implications for human sexual transmission. The ability of viral RNA to persist in immune-privileged sites or fluids has been described with increasing frequency for other emerging infectious diseases and can cause a burden on public health. This provides the impetus to utilize the model described here to better understand the mechanisms of CCHFV persistence and its effect on the development of long-term sequela.

AB Background
   Stroke is a major public health concern due to the morbidity and mortality associated with it. Identifying geographic areas with high stroke prevalence is important for informing public health interventions. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate geographic disparities and identify geographic hotspots of stroke prevalence in Florida.
   Materials and methods County-level stroke prevalence data for 2013 were obtained from the Florida Department of Health's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Geographic clusters of stroke prevalence were investigated using the Kulldorff's circular spatial scan statistics (CSSS) and Tango's flexible spatial scan statistics (FSSS) under Poisson model assumption. Exact McNemar's test was used to compare the proportion of cluster counties identified by each of the two methods. Both Cohen's Kappa and bias adjusted Kappa were computed to assess the level of agreement between CSSS and FSSS methods of cluster detection. Goodness-of-fit of the models were compared using Cluster Information Criterion. Identified clusters and selected stroke risk factors were mapped.
   Results
   Overall, 3.7% of adults in Florida reported that they had been told by a healthcare professional that they had suffered a stroke. Both CSSS and FSSS methods identified significant high prevalence stroke spatial clusters. However, clusters identified using CSSS tended to be larger than those identified using FSSS. The FSSS had a better fit than the CSSS. Most of the identified clusters are explainable by the prevalence distributions of the known risk factors assessed.
   Conclusions
   Geographic disparities of stroke risk exists in Florida with some counties having significant hotspots of high stroke prevalence. This information is important in guiding future research and control efforts to address the problem. Kulldorff's CSSS and Tango's FSSS are complementary to each other and should be used together to provide a more complete picture of the distributions of spatial clusters of health outcomes.

AB Background Currently in Australia there is a lack of clarity regarding routine assessment of primary school aged children's weight status despite it being the first step in the identification of overweight and obesity. The National Health and Medical Research Council Obesity Guidelines recommend primary health care professionals include routine weight status assessment in consultations with children yet research suggests this rarely occurs in practice. This study aimed to determine the views of primary health care professionals regarding routine weight status assessment in primary school aged children and to establish the barriers to assessing children's weight status. Methods Using the case study of a regional town, Rockhampton, purposeful sampling was used to represent the key primary health care settings and professional groups. Interviews were conducted with 31 health professionals. Data were collected and analysed guided by two frameworks, the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation and Behaviour and Theoretical Domains Frameworks. Results Eight themes emerged from data and these were relevant to the three levels of influence on the routine weight status of assessment, system, setting and individual. System level themes related to having a formalised program for the undertaking of routine weight status assessment in primary school aged children, increasing the population's awareness about the importance of the weight status check and limited public health services available for management of childhood overweight and obesity. Setting level theme regarded the location where routine weight status in primary school aged children could be undertaken. Four themes at the individual level of influence on the routine weight status assessment related to the primary health professionals' roles, barriers to assessing children's weight status, methods of weight status assessment and starting a weight related conversations with families. Conclusion The Government, primary health care services, professional organisations and associations as well as health professionals must commit to long-term implementation of the Obesity Guidelines. Immediate action to improve the undertaking of routine weight status assessment in children must be taken by each health service and health professional. Strategies should aim to positively affect motivation to assess children's weight status as it is the central component in creating change in practice.

AB Background This study aims to assess geographical distribution of hospitals and extent of inequalities in hospital beds against socioeconomic status (SES) of residents of five metropolitan cities in Iran. Methods A cross-sectional analysis was conducted to measure geographical inequality in hospital and hospital bed distributions of 68 districts in five metropolitan cities during 2016 using geographic information system (GIS), and Gini and Concentration indices. Correlation analysis was performed to show the relationship between the SES and inequality in hospital beds densities. Results The study uncovered marked inequalities in hospitals and hospital beds distributions. The Gini indices for hospital beds were greater than 0.55. The aggregated concentration indices for public and private hospital beds were 0.33 and 0.49, respectively. The GIS revealed that 216 (70.6%) hospitals were located in two highest socioeconomic status classes in the cities. Only 29 (9.5%) hospitals were located in the lowest class. The public, private, and the cumulative hospitals beds distributions in Tehran and Esfahan showed significant (p < 0.05) positive correlation with SES of the residents. Conclusions The high inequalities in hospital and hospital beds distributions in our study imply an overlooked but growing concern for geographical access to healthcare in rapidly urbanizing metropolitan cities in Iran. Thus, regardless of ownership, decision-makers should emphasize the disadvantaged areas in metropolitan cities when need arises for the establishment of new healthcare facilities in order to ensure fairness in healthcare. The metropolitan cities and rapid urbanization settings in other countries could learn lessons to reduce or prevent similar issues which might have hampered access to healthcare.

AB Background Many people receiving palliative care wish to die at home. Often, support from family or friends is key to ensuring that this wish is fulfilled. However, carers report feeling underprepared to undertake this role. This paper describes the process of developing a consensus and evidence based website to provide core information to help people support someone receiving palliative care on the island of Ireland. Methods The project comprised three phases: (1) a review of systematic reviews facilitated the identification of core information needs; (2) content was developed in collaboration with a Virtual Reference Group (VRG) comprising patients, carers and professionals; and, (3) subject experts within the project team worked with a web developer to precis the agreed content and ensure it was in a format that was appropriate for a website. Members of the VRG were then invited to test and approve the website before it was made available to the general public. Results Nineteen systematic reviews identified nine consensus areas of core information required by carers; a description of palliative care; prognosis and treatment of the condition; medication and pain management; personal care; specialist equipment; locally available support services; what to do in an emergency; nutrition; and, support for the carer. This information was shared with the VRG and used to develop website content. Conclusions We engaged with service users and professionals to develop an evidence-based website addressing the agreed core information needs of non-professional carers who wish to provide palliative care to a friend or relative.

AB Background
   We undertook this study to assess the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained with the use of pan-genotypic sofosbuvir (SOF) + velpatasvir (VEL) for HCV patients, as compared to the current treatment regimen under the universal free treatment scheme in Punjab state.
   Methodology
   A Markov model depicting natural history of HCV was developed to simulate the progression of disease. Three scenarios were compared: I (Current Regimen)-use of SOF + daclatasvir (DCV) for non-cirrhotic patients and ledipasvir (LDV) or DCV with SOF +/- ribavirin (RBV) according to the genotype for cirrhotic patients; II-use of SOF + DCV for non-cirrhotic patients and use of SOF+VEL for compensated cirrhotic patients (with RBV in decompensated cirrhosis patients) and III-use of SOF+VEL for both non-cirrhotic and compensated cirrhotic patients (with RBV in decompensated cirrhosis patients). The lifetime costs, life-years and QALYs were assessed for each scenario, using a societal perspective. All the future costs and health outcomes were discounted at an annual rate of 3%. Finally, the incremental cost per QALY gained was computed for each of scenario II and III, as compared to scenario I and for scenario III as compared to II. In addition, we evaluated the lifetime costs and QALYs among HCV patients for each of scenario I, II and III against the counterfactual of 'no universal free treatment scheme' scenario which involves patients purchasing care in routine setting of from public and private sector.
   Results
   Each of the scenarios I, II and III dominate over the no universal free treatment scheme scenario, i.e. have greater QALYs and lesser costs. The use of SOF+VEL only for cirrhotic patients (scenario II) increases QALYs by 0.28 (0.03 to 0.71) per person, and decreases the cost by (sic) 5,946 ((sic) 1,198 to (sic) 14,174) per patient, when compared to scenario I. Compared to scenario I, scenario III leads to an increase in QALYs by 0.44 (0.14 to 1.01) per person, and is cost-neutral. While the mean cost difference between scenario III and I is-(sic) 2,676 per patient, it ranges from a cost saving of (sic) 14,835 to incurring an extra cost of (sic) 3,456 per patient. For scenario III as compared II, QALYs increase by 0.16 (0.03 to 0.36) per person as well as costs by (sic) 3,086 per patient which ranges from a cost saving of. 1,264 to incurring an extra cost of (sic) 6,344. Shift to scenario II and III increases the program budget by 5.5% and 60% respectively.
   Conclusion
   Overall, the use of SOF+VEL is highly recommended for the treatment of HCV infection. In comparison to the current practice (scenario I), scenario II is a dominant option. Scenario III is cost-effective as compared to scenario II at a threshold of one-time GDP per capita. If budget is an important constraint, velpatasvir should be given to HCV infected cirrhotic patients. However, if no budget constraint, universal use of velpatasvir for HCV treatment is recommended.

   nationally representative study
SO PLOS ONE

   DISEASES; COUNTRIES; CHILDREN
AB Background
   For women of reproductive age, overweight and obesity are an established risk factor for several medical complications. To address the increasing rate of obesity in India through public health awareness programs, the association between common behaviors and overweight and obesity needs to be investigated. This study aims to determine whether there is any association between the frequency of television watching and overweight and obesity among women of reproductive age (15-49 years) in India.
   Methods
   This is a cross-sectional study that utilized data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4), which utilized a nationally representative sample from all 29 states and 7 union territories of India. The survey itself followed a two-staged stratified random sampling technique. The primary outcome of interest was overweight (23.0 kg/m(2) to <27.5 kg/m(2)) and obesity (>= 27.5 kg/m(2)), measured by using the Asian body mass index cut-off. The major explanatory variable was the frequency of television watching, measured in days per week. Sample weight of NFHS-4 was adjusted during the analysis. Multilevel ordered logistic regression was conducted to identify the factors associated with overweight and obesity. To show the strength of association, both the unadjusted Crude Odds Ratio (COR) and the Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) were reported with a 95% confidence interval (CI). A p-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
   Results
   The analysis included weighted data from 644,006 Indian women of reproductive age (15-49 years). Among the respondents, 33.5% were overweight or obese (BMI >= 23.0 kg/m(2)). The prevalence of overweight and obesity increased with age (p-value <0.0001) and almost half of the women aged 35-49 years were either overweight or obese (48.6%). The prevalence was significantly higher among those living in an urban area compared to a rural area (urban 46.5% vs. rural 26.5%; p-value <0.001). The prevalence of overweight and obesity increased with the frequency of watching television and was the highest among the individuals who reported watching television almost every day (p-value <0.0001). Women watching television almost every day had 24% (AOR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.21-1.26; p-value <0.001) increased odds of being overweight and obese compared to their counterparts who never watched television.
   Conclusions
   This study found that the likelihood of being overweight and obese significantly increased with the frequency of watching television; likely due to physical inactivity during leisure time. Further studies should examine the physical activity and food habits of this target group. Public health promotion programs in India should raise awareness regarding the harmful effects of the sedentary lifestyle associated with watching television.

TI Antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli
   isolated from small poultry flocks in Ontario, Canada: A two-year

AB Antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter, common in poultry, is a global public health issue. The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistant Campylobacter has been linked to the use of antimicrobials in food animals. Small poultry flocks are becoming increasingly popular not only as a source of food but also as pets, yet not all small flock owners are aware of proper antimicrobial use practices and safe food handling protocols. This trend could contribute to antimicrobial resistance. In order to determine the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter in small poultry flocks, we analyzed data from birds that had been submitted to a diagnostic laboratory in Ontario between October 2015 and September 2017. A pooled cecal sample was obtained from each submission and cultured for Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli. Three isolates were recovered from each positive sample and tested for susceptibility to nine antimicrobials using a broth microdilution method. Overall, 176 isolates were recovered (141 chicken, 21 turkey, 6 duck, and 8 game bird). A high frequency of resistance to tetracycline was observed in the C. jejuni isolates from chickens (77%) and turkeys (100%), and in the C. coli isolates from turkeys (50%) and game birds (40%). Campylobacter jejuni isolates had higher odds of resistance to tetracycline (OR = 3.54, P <= 0.01) compared to C. coli isolates. Overall, there was a low frequency of resistance to quinolones and a very low frequency of resistance to macrolides. Multidrug resistance was uncommon. The high prevalence of tetracycline resistance emphasizes the importance of prudent antimicrobial use in small flocks. Although low, the presence of resistance to macrolides and quinolones, which are used to treat campylobacteriosis in humans, highlights the need for proper food safety and infection control practices by small flock owners to prevent exposure to antimicrobial resistant Campylobacter.

AB Background Demand for gastrointestinal endoscopy in Australia is increasing as a result of the expanding national bowel cancer screening program and a growing, ageing population. More services are required to meet demand and ensure patients are seen within clinically recommended timeframes. Methods A discrete event simulation model was developed to project endoscopy waiting list outcomes for two large metropolitan health services encompassing 8 public hospitals in Australia. The model applied routinely collected health service data to forecast the impacts of future endoscopic demand over 5 years and to identify the level of service activity required to address patient waiting times and meet key policy targets. The approach incorporated evidence from the literature to produce estimates of cost-effectiveness by showing longer term costs and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) associated with service expansion. Results The modelling revealed that doing nothing would lead to the number of patients waiting longer than clinically recommended doubling across each health service within 5 years. A 38% overall increase in the number of monthly procedures available was required to meet and maintain a target of 95-98% of patients being seen within clinically recommended timeframes to the year 2021. This was projected to cost the funder approximately $140 million in additional activity over a 5 year period. Due to improved patient outcomes associated with timely intervention, it was estimated that the increased activity would generate over 22,000 additional QALYs across the two health services. This translated to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $6467 and $5974 per QALY for each health service respectively. Conclusions Discrete event simulation modelling provided a rational, data based approach that allowed decision makers to quantify the future demand for endoscopy services and identify cost-effective strategies to meet community needs.

AB Background Water advisories, especially those concerning boiling drinking water, are widely used to reduce risks of infection from contaminants in the water supply. Since the effectiveness of boil water advisories (BWAs) depends on public compliance, monitoring the public response to such advisories is essential for protecting human health. However, assessments of public compliance with BWAs remain sparse. Thus, this study was aimed at investigating awareness and compliance among residents who had received BWAs in Baerum municipality in Norway. Method We conducted a cross-sectional study among 2764 residents who had received water advisories by SMS in the municipality of Baerum between January and September 2017. We analysed data from two focus group discussions and an online survey sent to all residents who had received an advisory. We conducted descriptive analyses and calculated odds ratios (OR) using logistic regression to identify associations of compliance and awareness with demographic characteristics. Results Of the 611 respondents, 67% reported that they had received a water advisory notification. Effective compliance rate with safe drinking water practices, either by storing clean drinking water or boiling tap water, after a water outage was 72% among those who remembered receiving a notification. Compliance with safe drinking water advisories was lower among men than women (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.29-0.96), but was independent of age, education and household type. The main reason for respondents' non-compliance with safe water practices was that they perceived the water to be safe to drink after letting it flush through the tap until it became clear. Conclusions Awareness of advisories was suboptimal among residents who had received notifications, but compliance was high. The present study highlights the need to improve the distribution, phrasing and content of water advisory notifications to achieve greater awareness and compliance. Future studies should include hard-to-reach groups with adequate data collection approaches and examine the use of BWAs in a national context to inform future policies on BWAs.

AB BackgroundTungiasis is a relatively frequent ectoparasitosis in low-income settings, yet its morbidity and social impact are still not well understood due to the scarcity of information. In Rwanda, data on the magnitude and conditions leading to the tungiasis is rare. This study sought to determine the prevalence and factors associated with tungiasis among primary school children in Rwandan setting.MethodA descriptive cross-sectional study utilising systematic random sampling method was adopted to select 384 children from three primary schools. From July to October 2018, data were collected on socio-demographic characteristics of children, parents, and households. Logistic regression was applied to analyse socio-demographic factors associated with tungiasis with a level of significance set at P-value<0.05.ResultsPrevalence of tungiasis among three primary schools was 23%. Factors associated with tungiasis included walking barefoot (AOR: 78.41; 95% CI: 17.91-343.10), irregular wearing of shoes (AOR: 24.73; 95% CI: 6.27-97.41), having dirty feet (AOR: 12.69; 95% CI: 4.93-32.64), wearing dirty clothes (AOR: 12.69; 95% CI: 4.18-38.50), and living in a house with earthen plastered floor (AOR: 28.79; 95% CI: 7.11-116.57). Children infected with tungiasis attended class less frequently (AOR: 19.16, 95%CI: 7.20-50.97) and scored lower (AOR: 110.85, 95%CI: 43.08-285.20) than those non-infected. The low school attendance and poor performance could be partly explained by difficulty of walking, lack of concentration during school activities, and isolation or discrimination from classmates.ConclusionTungiasis was a public health challenge among school going children in a rural Rwandan setting. This study revealed that children affected with tungiasis had poor hygiene, inadequate housing environments and consequently poor school attendance and performance. Improving socio-economic conditions of households with special emphasis on hygiene of family members and housing conditions, would contribute to preventing tungiasis.

AB Background Evidence about the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions to reduce the incidence of depression and anxiety and promote subjective well-being in older people is limited, particularly in Latin-American countries. This study thus aims to assess a program specifically designed to address this issue in persons aged 65 to 80 and attending primary health care centres. Method Older people who use primary care centres are to be randomly assigned to the program or to a control group. Only independent users will be included; those having had a major depressive disorder or an anxiety disorder in the last 6 months will be excluded. The program is group based; it includes cognitive stimulation, expansion of social support networks and cognitive behaviour strategies. Depressive and anxiety symptoms and disorders, as well as psychological well-being, will be assessed using standardised instruments, once before implementing the program and later, after 18 and 36 weeks. Discussion Primary care is a setting where interventions to improve mental health can be beneficial. Providing evidence-based programs that work with older people is a priority for public mental health.

AB Background Loneliness and social isolation are major determinants of mental wellbeing, especially among older adults. The effectiveness of interventions to address loneliness and social isolation among older adults has been questioned due to the lack of transparency in identifying and recruiting populations at risk. This paper aims to systematically review methods used to identify and recruit older people at risk of loneliness and social isolation into research studies that seek to address loneliness and social isolation. Methods In total, 751 studies were identified from a structured search of eleven electronic databases combined with hand searching of reference bibliography from identified studies for grey literature. Studies conducted between January 1995 and December 2017 were eligible provided they recruited community living individuals aged 50 and above at risk of social isolation or loneliness into an intervention study. Result A total of 22 studies were deemed eligible for inclusion. Findings from these studies showed that the most common strategy for inviting people to participate in intervention studies were public-facing methods including mass media and local newspaper advertisements. The majority of participants identified this way were self-referred, and in many cases self-identified as lonely. In most cases, there was no standardised tool for defining loneliness or social isolation. However, studies that recruited via referral by recognised agencies reported higher rates of eligibility and enrolment. Referrals from primary care were only used in a few studies. Studies that included agency referral either alone or in combination with multiple forms of recruitment showed more promising recruitment rates than those that relied on only public facing methods. Further research is needed to establish the cost-effectiveness of multiple forms of referral. Conclusion Findings from this study demonstrate the need for transparency in writing up the methods used to approach, assess and enrol older adults at risk of becoming socially isolated. None of the intervention studies included in this review justified their recruitment strategies. The ability of researchers to share best practice relies greatly on the transparency of research.

AB Background
   Expanding public health insurance seeks to attain several desirable objectives, including increasing access to healthcare services, reducing the risk of catastrophic healthcare expenditures, and improving health outcomes. The extent to which these objectives are met in a real-world policy context remains an empirical question of increasing research and policy interest in recent years.
   Methods
   We reviewed systematically empirical studies published from July 2010 to September 2016 using Medline, Embase, Econlit, CINAHL Plus via EBSCO, and Web of Science and grey literature databases. No language restrictions were applied. Our focus was on both randomised and observational studies, particularly those including explicitly attempts to tackle selection bias in estimating the treatment effect of health insurance. The main outcomes are: (1) utilisation of health services, (2) financial protection for the target population, and (3) changes in health status.
   Findings
   8755 abstracts and 118 full-text articles were assessed. Sixty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria including six randomised studies, reflecting a substantial increase in the quantity and quality of research output compared to the time period before 2010. Overall, health insurance schemes in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have been found to improve access to health care as measured by increased utilisation of health care facilities (32 out of 40 studies). There also appeared to be a favourable effect on financial protection (26 out of 46 studies), although several studies indicated otherwise. There is moderate evidence that health insurance schemes improve the health of the insured (9 out of 12 studies).
   Interpretation
   Increased health insurance coverage generally appears to increase access to health care facilities, improve financial protection and improve health status, although findings are not totally consistent. Understanding the drivers of differences in the outcomes of insurance reforms is critical to inform future implementations of publicly funded health insurance to achieve the broader goal of universal health coverage.

AB Objectives
   This study aimed at analyzing the cycling safety-related factors and the mental health indicators of elderly cyclists in comparison with other age groups.
   Methods
   For this cross-sectional study, we analyzed the data of 911 bicyclists from two Latin American countries that have been experiencing a substantial growth of urban cycling during the last few years: Colombia and Argentina. Participants responded to an e-questionnaire on bicycling behaviors, mental health and cycling safety.
   Results
   Aging adults reported lower rates of risky behaviors and traffic crashes (around .38 in five years), and, on the other hand, more cycling protective behaviors, a higher risk perception and a better knowledge of traffic norms than both other adults (26-50 years old) and young cyclists (<26). Cycling behaviors and crashes were found to be significantly related to mental health indicators, the latter being higher in aging cyclists. However, this population remains more prone to distractions experienced while cycling than other age groups.
   Conclusions
   Although the behavioral features of aging adults were comparatively "safer" than the ones displayed by other age groups, factors such as cycling distractions and this population's over-representation in traffic crashes suggest the need of enforcing policymaking for a better integration of this age segment in alternative transportation dynamics.

TI Stakeholder perceptions on patient-centered care at primary health care
   level in rural eastern Uganda: A qualitative inquiry
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; INTERVENTION DESIGN; OF-CARE; WORKERS;
   INFORMATION; PERFORMANCE; COMPASSION; OUTCOMES; VISION
AB Background
   Patient-centered care (PCC) offers opportunities for African health systems to improve quality of care. Nonetheless, PCC continually faces implementation challenges. In 2015, Uganda introduced PCC as a concept in their national quality improvement guidelines. In order to investigate whether and how this is implemented in practice, this study aims to identify relevant stakeholders' views on the current quality of primary health care services and their understanding of PCC. This is an important step in understanding how the concept of PCC can be implemented in a resource constrained, sub-Saharan context like Uganda.
   Methods
   This qualitative study was conducted in Uganda at national, district and facility level, with a focus on three public and three private health centres. Data collection consisted of in-depth interviews (n = 49); focus group discussions (n = 7); and feedback meetings (n = 14) across the four main categories of stakeholders identified: patients/communities, health workers, policy makers and academia. Interviews and discussions explored stakeholder perceptions on the interpersonal aspects of quality primary health care and meanings attached to the concept of PCC. A content analysis of Ugandan policy documents mentioning PCC was also conducted. Thematic content analysis was conducted using NVivo 11 to organize and analyze the data.
   Findings and conclusion
   While Ugandan stakeholder groups have varying perceptions of PCC, they agree on the following: the need to involve patients in making decisions about their health, the key role of healthcare workers in that endeavor, and the importance of context in designing and implementing solutions. For that purpose, three avenues are recommended: Firstly, fora that include a wide range of stakeholders may offer a powerful opportunity to gain an inclusive vision on PCC in Uganda. Secondly, efforts need to be made to ensure that improved communication and information sharing-important components of PCC-translate to actual shared decision making. Lastly, the Ugandan health system needs to strengthen its engagement of the transformation from a community health worker system to a more comprehensive community health system. Cross-cutting the entire analysis, is the need to address, in a culturally-sensitive way, the many structural barriers in designing and implementing PCC policies. This is essential in ensuring the sustainable and effective implementation of PCC approaches in low-and middle-income contexts.

   PREHYPERTENSION; POPULATIONS; PREVENTION; MANAGEMENT; CHILDREN
AB Background
   Prevention and control of hypertension has not been given due attention though previous studies indicated that hypertension is growing public health problem.
   Objective
   This study aimed to determine the prevalence of hypertension and associated factors in Bona district, southern Ethiopia.
   Methods
   A community based cross-sectional study was conducted on 1952 participants aged >= 25 years in Bona District, southern Ethiopia. Data were collected from consented participants recruited using multistage sampling technique. Data were entered, checked for quality and analyzed by SPSS for Windows version 20.0. Since the outcome variables were ordered categorical, we used multinomial logistic regression model to identify associated factors. Among the independent variables included in the model no multicolinearity was observed. The level of significance was set at P value <= 0.05.
   Results
   The observed prevalence of hypertension (21.8%) was remarkable in rural setting. Out of hypertensive participants, 195 (45.9%) were newly diagnosed. About one third of the participants (31.4%) had central obesity measured by waist-to-height ratio >= 0.50. Being male, age advancement, high BMI (>= 25.0 kg/m(2)) and central obesity (waist-to-height ratio >= 0.50) were positively associated with both systolic and diastolic hypertension. Systolic hypertension was negatively associated with high family income. The likely hood of developing diastolic hypertension increased in participants with family history of hypertension.
   Conclusion
   The overall prevalence of hypertension, 21.8%, is alarmingly high that it can be said that hypertension is becoming a silent epidemic in Ethiopia. Nationwide survey is needed to get the clear magnitude of hypertension so that early detection and management strategies can be enforced.

TI Stakeholders' perspectives on Public Health Medicine in South Africa
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CARE; PHYSICIANS; DOCTORS
AB South Africa (SA) is reforming its health system in preparation for an anticipated national health insurance (NHI) scheme that aims to improve the delivery of affordable, equitable, accessible health care. Public health (PH) language is explicit in the policy and skilled PH professionals would be expected to play a key role in its implementation. In South Africa, training of doctors as Public Health Medicine (PHM) specialists is funded by the state, yet there are few positions for PHM specialists in the health services. We explored stakeholders' perspectives about this absence, and their views on PHM specialist' roles and contribution in an era of health reform. A qualitative study was conducted in 2012-13, using in-depth interviews with thematic analysis, which elicited perspectives of 31 key stakeholders nationally reflecting diverse employer and institutional backgrounds. While some were surprised by the absence of PH professionals in SA's health system, most agreed the reason was due to factors internal to the profession, such as its low profile and uncertain identity. External factors such as legislation and political preferences for health managers impacted on the employment of PH professionals. However, given the competencies required to implement an ambitious restructuring of the health sector, all believed that PH and PHM personnel were vital. In view of the health system's dominant curative orientation, embedding PH personnel in the services should ensure that health protection, promotion and prevention strategies will inform health priorities. This study, the first known from a low and middle-income country, contributes to the international literature about the identity and roles of PHM physicians, who are versatile professionals with broad skills-sets. In SA, through consultation with health sector employers about potential roles, curricular redesign and trainee recruitment, PHM can graduate fit-forpurpose specialists to work in a range of institutions to address health system reform.

TI A qualitative study of health promotion in academy schools in England
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Health; Education; School; Children; Adolescence; Qualitative
AB Background Schools are an important setting for health promotion. In England, around one third of publicly funded schools have become independent of local authorities since 2000 and are now academies, run by an academy trust. The aim of this research was to examine attitudes towards health promotion held by academy trust leaders and senior staff. The research questions were: 1. How do academy trusts in England perceive their role in health promotion amongst students? 2. How are decisions around health promotion made in academy trusts? 3. What factors inhibit and encourage health promotion in academy schools? 4. How might public health academics and practitioners best engage with academy schools to facilitate health promotion activity and research? Methods Qualitative study utilising semi-structured interviews. Twenty five academy and school leaders were purposively sampled to achieve variation in trust size and type. In addition, five respondents were recruited from public and third-sector agencies seeking to work with or influence academy trusts around health promotion. Framework analysis was used to determine emergent themes and identify relationships between themes and respondent type. Early findings were triangulated at a stakeholder event with 40 delegates from academia, local authority public health teams, and third sector organisations. Results There is wide variation amongst senior academy and trust leaders in how they perceive the role of academies in promoting health and wellbeing amongst students. There is also variability in whether academy trusts responsible for more than one school adopt a centralised strategy to health promotion or allow individual schools autonomy. This was dependent on the trust leaders' attitude and interest in health promotion rather than any perceived external accountability. Identified barriers to health promotion include financial constraints, a narrow focus on educational outcomes and school performance, and limited understanding about effective health interventions. Conclusion In the current absence of national policy or guidance around health promotion in schools, health has variable status in academies in England. There is a need to better engage all academy trusts in health promotion and support them to implement a strategic approach to health promotion.

AB BackgroundPrevious research suggests that providing generalized information about the health implications of air pollution from fossil fuels may be effective at promoting public support for a transition to cleaner sources of energy. We sought to extend that work by identifying the specific messages about the health implications of air pollution from fossil fuels that are most and least concerning to people, and whether rankings of concern vary among different audiences. We also hypothesized that reading the statements would influence people's attitudes and behavioral intentions in a manner supportive of a transition to cleaner sources of energy.MethodsWe conducted a survey with a diverse sample of U.S. adults (n=1644) from a non-probability internet panel. Using maximum difference scaling, participants ranked a set of ten statements that revealed which statements were the most and least concerning to them. We also measured attitudes about air pollution and energy use before and after the ranking exercise to assess changes in opinion caused by cumulative exposure to the messages.ResultsAcross all sub-groups examined, participants were most concerned by a message about the neurological impacts of air pollution on babies and children. After the ranking exercise, participants expressed increases in perceived health harm of air pollution and fossil fuels, a desire for more clean energy, and intention to engage in consumer advocacy to support clean energy.ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this study is the first to assess how people respond to information about the neurological health harms of air pollution from fossil fuels. While efforts to communicate the cardio-pulmonary health harms of air pollution are well established, our study suggests that efforts should now be organized to communicate the neurological effects of air pollution from fossil fuels, especially the neuro-developmental effects on babies and children.

AB BackgroundNational and international strategies have increasingly promoted chronic patient participation at different levels of the health care system, building the image of an active' chronic patient engaged for example in his/her daily self-care and within associations dealing with service delivery and/or policy advocacy. Drawing upon examples of the fight against diabetes and HIV/AIDS in Mali, this article explores the factors that influence the engagement of patient associations at policy level. We focus on the openness of the institutionalised political system, and explore the role that public authorities, caregivers and donors give to diabetes and HIV/AIDS patients.MethodsData was collected between 2008 and 2014 in Bamako in the framework of a qualitative research. Thirty-eight actors fighting against diabetes were interviewed, as well as 17 representatives of donors. For HIV/AIDS, 27 actors were interviewed. In both cases, non-participant observation was carried out and documentary sources were collected. Based on theory of public and collective action, a historical and cognitive approach was adopted. Data analysis followed an inductive and iterative method.ResultsPartnerships between public authorities and diabetes patient associations have been intermittent over time and remained rather informal. In the case of people living with HIV/AIDS, the partnership between their associations and public authorities has steadily grown and was progressively institutionalised. Three political factors explain this difference: focus and extent of the commitment of public authorities, existing policy-making processes, and how the law frames patients' roles. Moreover, opportunities for patient participation depend on the nature and extent of the support provided by international donors. Finally, the cognitive dimension is also at stake, notably in relation to the way the two diseases and patients have been perceived by public authorities, caregivers, and donors.ConclusionsChronic patients are intermittent partners for policy-makers. Despite the image of chronic active patients conveyed by national and international public health strategies, patient participation is not straightforward. Rather, political, economic, and cognitive factors underpin the presence of political opportunities that enable patient participation. Chronicity of the disease appears to play an ambiguous role in the shaping of these factors.

AB Background Three large new trials of unprecedented scale and cost, which included novel factorial designs, have found no effect of basic water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions on childhood stunting, and only mixed effects on childhood diarrhea. Arriving at the inception of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, and the bold new target of safely managed water, sanitation and hygiene for all by 2030, these results warrant the attention of researchers, policy-makers and practitioners. Main body Here we report the conclusions of an expert meeting convened by the World Health Organization and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to discuss these findings, and present five key consensus messages as a basis for wider discussion and debate in the WASH and nutrition sectors. We judge these trials to have high internal validity, constituting good evidence that these specific interventions had no effect on childhood linear growth, and mixed effects on childhood diarrhea. These results suggest that, in settings such as these, more comprehensive or ambitious WASH interventions may be needed to achieve a major impact on child health. Conclusion These results are important because such basic interventions are often deployed in low-income rural settings with the expectation of improving child health, although this is rarely the sole justification. Our view is that these three new trials do not show that WASH in general cannot influence child linear growth, but they do demonstrate that these specific interventions had no influence in settings where stunting remains an important public health challenge. We support a call for transformative WASH, in so much as it encapsulates the guiding principle that - in any context - a comprehensive package of WASH interventions is needed that is tailored to address the local exposure landscape and enteric disease burden.

AB Background Enterocytozoon bieneusi has been increasingly reported to infect domestic animals and humans, with human infections primarily reported as zoonotic in origin. The aim of the present study was to determine the presence and genotype of E. bieneusi in humans and domestic animals in central Thailand by testing stool samples of 200 apparently healthy humans, 73 goats, 60 cattle and 65 pigs using nested-PCR/ sequence analysis based on the ITS region of SSU rRNA genes. Results E. bieneusi tested positive in 2 (1%) of the 200 stool samples collected from humans and 56 (28.3%) of the 198 stool samples collected from domestic animals. The highest prevalence of E. bieneusi was observed in pigs (39/65, 60%), followed by goats (14/73, 19.2%) and cattle (3/60, 5%). Seven novel E. bieneusi genotypes were identified, which were named GoatAYE1-4 and PigAYE1-3 and clustered in either zoonotic Group 1 or Group 2. Moreover, eleven previously described E. bieneusi genotypes were also identified (O, D, H, SX1, CHC8, CHG3, CS-10, SHZC1, LW1, WildBoar5, and EbpC). All novel genotypes exhibited zoonotic potential from a phylogenetic analysis of ITS region. Conclusion Our data showed that the prevalence of E. bieneusi is low in apparently healthy individuals and higher in pigs than cattle and goats. This study provides baseline data useful for controlling and preventing E. bieneusi infection in farm communities, where pigs and goats appear to be the major reservoir of E. bieneusi. The results of our study support the view that E. bieneusi is a zoonotic pathogen that should be considered a potential public health threat.

TI Precision public health: Mapping socioeconomic disparities in opioid
   dispensations at Swedish pharmacies by Multilevel Analysis of Individual
   Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (MAIHDA)

DT Article

   DETERMINANTS; ASSOCIATION; MORTALITY
AB Background
   In light of the opioid epidemic in the United States, there is growing concern about the use of opioids in Sweden as it may lead to misuse and overuse and, in turn, severe public health problems. However, little is known about the distribution of opioid use across different demographic and socioeconomic dimensions in the Swedish general population. Therefore, we applied an intersectional Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (MAIHDA), to obtain an improved mapping of the risk heterogeneity of and socioeconomic inequalities in opioid prescription receipt.
   Methods and findings
   Using data from 6,846,106 residents in Sweden aged 18 and above, we constructed 72 intersectional strata from combinations of gender, age, income, cohabitation status, and presence or absence of psychological distress. We modelled the absolute risk (AR) of opioid prescription receipt in a series of multilevel logistic regression models distinguishing between additive and interaction effects. By means of the Variance Partitioning Coefficient (VPC) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), we quantified the discriminatory accuracy (DA) of the intersectional strata for discerning those who received opioid prescriptions from those who did not.
   The AR of opioid prescription receipt ranged from 2.77% (95% CI 2.69-2.86) among low-income men aged 18-34, living alone, without psychological distress, to 28.25% (95% CI 27.95-28.56) among medium-income women aged 65 and older, living alone, with psychological distress. In a model that conflated both additive and interaction effects, the intersectional strata had a fair DA for discerning opioid users from non-users (VPC = 13.2%, AUC = 0.68). However, in the model that decomposed total effects into additive and interaction effects, the VPC was very low (0.42%) indicating the existence of small interaction effects for a number of the intersectional strata.
   Conclusions
   The intersectional MAIHDA approach aligns with the aims of precision public health, through improving the evidence base for health policy by increasing understanding of both health inequalities and individual heterogeneity. This approach is particularly relevant for socioeconomically conditioned outcomes such as opioid prescription receipt. We have identified intersections of social position within the Swedish population at greater risk for opioid prescription receipt.

AB BackgroundAntimicrobial resistance is one of the most serious public health threats of the twenty-first century. The implementation of AMR surveillance in Zimbabwe is limited. However, data from a private laboratory in Harare revealed increasing resistance rates to common antibiotics like ampicillin (i.e., from 73.9% in 2011 to 74.6% in 2015). The increasing resistance rates indicate that Zimbabwe is affected by AMR. This study was done to determine the magnitude of AMR in Harare and determine the trends of AMR to first-line and to last-resort antibiotics and make recommendations to mitigate the problem.MethodsA retrospective record review of data collected from the microbiology department at a private laboratory between January 2012 and December 2017 was done. The outcome of interest was the antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial isolates. Microsoft Excel 2016 was used to plot trends from 2012 to 2017 and Epi Info (TM) 7 was used for statistical analysis.ResultsA total of 23,432 isolates, of 12 medically important bacteria were analysed. Forty-three percent of the isolates were from urines, 36.7% were from pus swabs and 7% were from blood. The most common pathogen was Escherichia coli (43.2%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (15.8%) and the least common was Neisseria gonorrhoea (0.2%). Resistance was highest to ampicillin followed by penicillin, both ranging between 70 and 100% over the six years. Statistically significant increases in resistance to commonly used antibiotics were observed in amoxicillin-resistant E. coli and Streptococcus pneumonia and third generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli. There was an increase in resistance to last-line antibiotics i.e., fluoroquinolone-resistant Salmonella spp. and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. However, methicillin-resistant S. aureus showed a decreasing trend.ConclusionsThere is a high burden of drug resistance to common antibiotics in Harare and an emergence of resistance to last-line antibiotics.

AB BackgroundFew studies exploring the actual practices implemented for long-term mental health and psychosocial support after a natural disaster have been published. This study aimed to reveal (1) the types of activities that were actually provided as mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) in the long-term phase after the Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE) and (2) the problems that must be addressed to provide post-disaster MHPSS activities.MethodsAn open-ended questionnaire was sent to organizations in the Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures that were potentially involved in providing MHPSS to communities affected by the GEJE. The organizations were asked to describe their activities and the problems that needed to be addressed to provide these support activities. The collected statements were analysed using content analysis with NVivo11.ResultsThe support activities conducted to provide MHPSS in the long-term phase after the catastrophe were diverse and classified into 7 major categories, namely, (1) one-on-one support for individuals in need of assistance, (2) support for collective activities, (3) support around living conditions and income, (4) increasing public awareness about mental health, (5) human resource development to improve response capabilities for MHPSS, (6) support for MHPSS providers, and (7) facilitating collaborations among the MHPSS activities provided to affected communities. Problems with human resources and funding were the most frequently mentioned concerns among the organizations participating in the survey.ConclusionsThe establishment of systems to collect and share sufficient and relevant knowledge and to coordinate organizations for long-term post-disaster postventions would be desirable.

AB BackgroundTuberculosis (TB) remains a major global public health problem in many developing countries including Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Patient compliance with anti-tuberculosis treatment is a determining factor in controlling the spread of TB. This study compares the default rate and the perception of their treatment among TB patients being treated by means of a community mobile outreach approach, with those of patients being treated by means of a facility-based Directly Observed Treatment Short course (DOTS) in the Jeddah region of Saudi Arabia.MethodsA comparative cross-sectional study of 200TB patients who presented at the Madain Alfahd Primary Health Care Center (PHCC) Jeddah, between January 2018 and November 2018 was undertaken. In one group, randomly assigned patients were served by mobile outreach teams who administered oral anti-TB treatment under the DOTS regime. In the other group, the patients were treated by means of the traditional facility-based DOTS treatment. A questionnaire measuring patient attitudes and understanding of the disease and their treatment modes was completed by patients at the beginning of their treatment, and again after 3months. The results were analysed by means of independent and Paired T Tests, along with chi square analysis.ResultsWe found that the overall default rate among those patients served by our mobile outreach team was only 3%, compared with a 22% default rate among non-mobile team treated patients (p=<0.001). A major change in the attitude and understanding scores of patients was noted in both groups after 3months. A significant difference was also noted in the mean compliance scores (mobile team served =58.43 and facility-based =55.55, p<0.001) after 3months of treatment.ConclusionOur study indicated that treatment by means of our mobile outreach DOTS can offer an effective strategy for the treatment of TB patients. A reduced patient default rate and a better understanding of the disease and its treatment confirmed a positive impact of mobile outreach teams on these patients. Treating TB patients by means of mobile outreach teams can thus be recommended as a means for the cure and prevention of the further spread of the disease.

AB BackgroundExisting evidence identifies health benefits for children of additional daily physical activity (PA) on a range of cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes. The Daily Mile (TDM) is a popular scheme designed to increase children's PA within the school day. Emerging evidence indicates that participation in TDM can increase children's PA, reduce sedentarism and reduce skinfold measures. However, little is known about the potential effects of TDM as a public health intervention, and the benefits and disbenefits that might flow from wider implementation in real world' settings.MethodsWe aimed to identify how TDM is being implemented in a naturalistic setting, and what implications this has for its potential impact on population health. We undertook a rapid ethnographic assessment of uptake and implementation in Lewisham, south London. Data included interviews (n=22) and focus groups (n=11) with stakeholders; observations of implementation in 12 classes; and analysis of routine data sources to identify school level factors associated with uptake.ResultsOf the 69 primary schools in one borough, 33 (48%) had adopted TDM by September 2018. There were no significant differences between adopters and non-adopters in mean school population size (means 377 vs 397, P=0.70), mean percentage of children eligible for free school meals (16.2 vs 14.3%, P=0.39), or mean percentage of children from Black and Minority Ethnic populations (76.3 vs 78.2%, P=0.41). Addressing obesity was a key incentive for adoption, although a range of health and educational benefits were also hypothesised to accrue from participation. Mapping TDM to the TIDierR-PHP checklist to describe the intervention in practice identified that considerable adaption happened at the level of borough, school, class and pupil. Population health effects are likely to be influenced by the interaction of intervention and context at each of these levels.ConclusionsExamining TDM in real world' settings surfaces adaptions and variations in implementation. This has implications for the likely effects of TDM, and points more broadly to an urgent need for more appropriate methods for evaluating public health impact and implementation in complex contexts.

AB BackgroundDespite an increased uptake of option B+ treatment among HIV- positive pregnant and breastfeeding women, retaining these women in care is still a major challenge. Previous studies have identified factors associated with loss to follow-up (LTFU) in HIV care, however, the perspectives from HIV-positive pregnant and breastfeeding women regarding their LTFU in option B+ needs further exploration. We explored reasons for LTFU and motivation to resume treatment among HIV-positive women initiated in option B+ in an Urban setting.MethodsA descriptive qualitative study was conducted at three public care and treatment clinics (CTC) (Buguruni health center, Sinza hospital, and Mbagala Rangitatu health center) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania between February and May 2017. In-depth interviews were conducted with 30 HIV-positive pregnant and breastfeeding women who were lost to follow up in the option B+ regimen. Analysis of data followed content analysis that was performed using NVivo 10 computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software.ResultsEleven women were lost to follow-up and did not resume Option B+, while 19 had resumed treatment. The study indicated a struggle with long term disease amongst HIV-positive pregnant and breastfeeding women initiated in option B+ treatment. The reported reasons contributing to LTFU among these women appeared in three categories. The contribution of LTFU in the first category namely health-related factors included medication side effects and lack of disease symptoms. The second category highlighted the contribution of psychological factors such as loss of hope, fear of medication side effects and HIV-related stigma. The third category underscored the influence of socio-economic statuses such as financial constraints, lack of partner support, family conflicts, non-disclosure of HIV-positive status, and religious beliefs. Motivators to resume treatment after LTFU included support from health care providers and family members, a desire to protect the unborn child from HIV-infection and a need to maintain a healthy status.ConclusionThe study has highlighted the reasons for LTFU and motivation to resume treatment among women initiated in Option B+. Our results provide further evidence on the need for future interventions to focus on these factors in order to improve retention in life-long treatment.

AB Background Diabetes-related kidney disease is associated with end-stage renal disease and mortality, but opportunities remain to quantify its association with cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular morbidity outcomes. Methods We used the Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database, 2010-2014, which includes specific health services records for employees and their dependents from a selection of large employers, health plans, and government and public organizations. We used administrative claims data to quantify the association between diabetes-related kidney disease and end-stage renal disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke, and infections. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios of developing complications. Results Among 2.2 million patients with diabetes, 7.1% had diabetes-related kidney disease: 13.5%, stage 1-2; 33.8%, stage 3; 13.2% stages 4-5; 39.5%, unknown stage. In multivariable Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for demographic characteristics, baseline comorbid conditions, and total hospital days during the baseline period, hazard ratios for each outcome increased with greater diabetes-related kidney disease severity (stage 1-2 vs. stage 4-5) compared with no diabetes-related kidney disease: myocardial infarction, 1.2 (95% confidence interval 1.1-1.4) and 3.1 (2.9-3.4); congestive heart failure, 1.7 (1.6-1.9) and 5.6 (5.3-5.8); stroke, 1.3 (1.2-1.5) and 2.3 (2.1-2.5); infection, 1.4 (1.3-1.5) and 2.9 (2.8-3.0). Among patients with stage 4-5 disease, 36-month cumulative incidence was nearly 22.8% for congestive heart failure, and 25.8% for infections. Conclusions Diabetes-related kidney disease appears to be formally diagnosed at a more advanced stage than might be expected, given clinical practice guidelines. Risks of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular outcomes are high.

AB Background In Madhya Pradesh, India, the government invited private obstetric hospitals for partnership to provide intrapartum care to poor women, paid for by the state. This statewide program, the Janani Sahayogi Yojana (JShY or maternal support scheme), ran from 2006 to 2012. The partnership was an uneasy one with many private obstetricians choosing to leave the partnership. This paper explores the motives of private obstetricians in the state for participating in the JShY, their experiences within the partnership, their interactions with the state and motives for withdrawal among those who withdrew from the scheme. This study sheds light on the dynamics of a public-private partnership for obstetric care from the perspective of private sector obstetricians. Method Fifteen in-depth interviews were conducted with private obstetricians and hospital administrators from eight districts of Madhya Pradesh who had participated in the JShY. A Framework approach was used to analyze the data. Results Private obstetricians reported entering the JShY partnership for altruistic reasons but also as way of expanding their practices and reputations. They perceived that although their facilities provided better quality of care than state facilities, participation was risky because beneficiaries were often unbooked and seen as 'high risk' cases. The need to arrange for blood transfusions for these high risk women was perceived as particularly difficult. Cumbersome paper work and delays in receiving payments from the state also dissuaded participation. Some participants felt that there was inadequate engagement by the state, and better monitoring and supervision would have helped. The state changed the financial reimbursement arrangements due to a high proportion of Cesarean births in the early years of the partnership, as these were perversely incentivized. This change resulted in a large exodus of private obstetricians from the partnership. Conclusion This study highlights the contribution of cumbersome processes, trust deficits and a lack of dialogue between public and private partners. Input from both public and private sectors into the design of a carefully thought through financial reimbursement package for private partners was highlighted as a necessary component for future success of such schemes.

ID VILLAGE DOCTORS; MANAGEMENT; CAPACITY; POLICY
AB Background: Providing universal basic public health services (BPHS) for residents is the main goal of the new health reform in China. Lay health workers (LHWs) in primary health care (PHC) sectors play key roles in BPHS delivery. The competency of LHWs is critical to quality BPHS. This study assessed LHWs' competency to deliver BPHS and related training in resource-limited Southwest China.
   Methods: A mixed research method combining in-depth interviews with secondary data collection was used to collect data in this cross-sectional study. Fifty-four LHWs and 16 leaders in 16 PHC sectors were recruited for in-depth interviews. Secondary data on 198 LHWs were collected through standard forms.
   Results: Both the interviews and secondary data suggested that all PHC sectors did not have sufficient LHWs and lacked qualified LHWs to deliver BPHS overall, particularly in relatively low economic rural areas in Guizhou province. Furthermore, PHC sectors had difficulties retaining existing LHWs due to low incomes and fewer opportunities for self-development. In-depth interviews discovered that, although numerous training opportunities have been provided for LHWs since 2009, the trainings did not achieve the expected outcome in LHW competency building, as LHWs actually did not have access to the trainings and the training design was unresponsive to the actual needs of LHWs. Both LHWs and leaders expressed an urgent need for effective training for LHWs based on systematic needs assessments and the use of qualified trainers and materials.
   Conclusions: The shortage of qualified LHWs in PHC sectors became the bottleneck for BPHS delivery in Southwest China. Recent trainings for LHWs were less effective with regard to LHW competency building. A need-based professional training programme for LHWs by qualified trainers was expected by both LHWs and leaders in PHC sectors.

AB China relaxed its family planning policy and adopted a universal two-child policy on January 1, 2016 to actively address the country's aging trend. However, the policy has failed to have any significant effect on the fertility rate of many provinces. In light of the country having the highest sex ratio at birth in the world and the huge burden of the aging population, improving the fertility rate is an urgent priority in China. This facility-based cross-sectional survey aimed to study determinants of fertility decision-making among couples based on the Theory of Planned Behavior. The study was conducted in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China. A structured self-administered questionnaire was completed by 1,399 couples, consisting of wives aged 20-49 years and their husbands. Based on the structural equation modeling method of analysis, determinants of fertility decision-making were perceived behavior control (perceived importance of having a stable income and cost of raising a child), subjective norms (perceived social pressure about "sex preference of the newborn by themselves and their partner") and attitudes (only healthy parents can have a child). Other significant factors influencing fertility decision were ethnicity and education level, with ethnic minority couples having less perception of social norm towards fertility and those with higher education having higher perceived control toward having a (further) child. The study reveals the importance of the China's infrastructure and public facilities to support child-rearing to increase the fertility rate among couples of child-bearing age, which in turn will reduce the burden associated with an aging society.

ID RISK PERCEPTION; EARTHQUAKE; KNOWLEDGE
AB Reconstruction has progressed steadily since the 2011 TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station accident. However, some people still hesitate to eat foods from Fukushima or to travel there, and there are concerns about the health risks of radiation. We investigated the relationships among reconstruction-related behavior, risk perception, types of information, and information sources, in order to consider appropriate measures for providing information and promoting reconstruction-related behavior a number of years after the accident. We conducted an online questionnaire survey (n = 1000) of Tokyo residents. First, a factor analysis was conducted on knowledge associated with radiation. Two factors were extracted; namely, "physical knowledge"and "health/social knowledge."We conducted structural equation modeling to construct a model of "knowledge," "radiation risk perception," and "intention concerning reconstruction-related behavior." "Intention concerning reconstruction-related behavior"decreased with "radiation risk perception" and increased with "health/social knowledge." In addition, "health/social knowledge" negatively affected "radiation risk perception; "this effect was not large, but it was significant. Second, respondents were clarified by information sources using a cluster analysis. Clusters that included respondents who got information from public relations materials issued by municipalities and websites of administrative agencies had a higher factor score for "health/social knowledge" than other clusters. The cluster of respondents who did not get any particular knowledge had the lowest factor score, which was significant, and also had a low "perception of reconstruction."

AB Background Dengue, a viral disease transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, is an important public health concern throughout Thailand. Climate variables are potential predictors of dengue transmission. Associations between climate variables and dengue have usually been performed on large-scale first-level national administrative divisions, i.e. provinces. Here we analyze data on a finer spatial resolution in one province, which is often more relevant for effective disease control design. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of seasonal variations, monthly climate variability, and to identify local clusters of symptomatic disease at the sub-district level based on reported dengue cases. Methods Data on dengue cases were retrieved from the national communicable disease surveillance system in Thailand. Between 2006 and 2016, 15,167 cases were recorded in 199 sub-districts of Khon Kaen Province, northeastern Thailand. Descriptive analyses included demographic characteristics and temporal patterns of disease and climate variables. The association between monthly disease incidence and climate variations was analyzed at the sub-district level using Bayesian Poisson spatial regression. A hotspot analysis was used to assess the spatial patterns (clustered/dispersed/random) of dengue incidence. Results Dengue was predominant in the 5-14 year-old age group (51.1%). However, over time, dengue incidence in the older age groups (> 15 years) gradually increased and was the most affected group in 2013. Dengue outbreaks coincide with the rainy season. In the spatial regression model, maximum temperature was associated with higher incidence. The hotspot analysis showed clustering of cases around the urbanized area of Khon Kaen city and in rural areas in the southwestern portion of the province. Conclusions There was an increase in the number of reported dengue cases in older age groups over the study period. Dengue incidence was highly seasonal and positively associated with maximum ambient temperature. However, climatic variables did not explain all the spatial variation of dengue in the province. Further analyses are needed to clarify the detailed effects of urbanization and other potential environmental risk factors. These results provide useful information for ongoing prediction modeling and developing of dengue early warning systems to guide vector control operations.

AB Background
   Drug abuse and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), remain significant public health concerns in the United States. Youth are at disproportionate risk of drug use and STIs/HIV, yet interventions aimed at improving STI and HIV testing and reducing STI/HIV risk behaviors through technology-based engagement in clinic settings are limited. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and acceptability of Storytelling 4 Empowerment (S4E), a multilevel mobile-health drug abuse and STI/HIV preventive application (app) for clinic settings. We also explored uptake of STI/HIV testing among youth immediately post-intervention.
   Method
   Employing community-based participatory research principles and a multi-method research design, we developed a clinician-facing app, and examined the feasibility and acceptability of S4E among clinicians (n = 6) and youth (n = 20) in an urban youth-centered community health clinic. S4E aimed to improve clinician youth risk communication and youths' drug use and STI/HIV knowledge, self-efficacy, and refusal skills. We also explored youths' uptake of STI and HIV testing. Quantitative data were analyzed by computing mean scores and proportions, and qualitative analyses followed the tenets of content analysis.
   Results
   Among eligible participants, 86.9% of youth and 85.7% of clinicians enrolled in the study, suggesting the feasibility of recruiting participants from the targeted clinic. Most clinicians identified as non-Hispanic white (83%) and female (66.7%). Among the youth, 70% identified as non-Hispanic white, followed by 30% African American, and 50% identified as female with a mean age of 19.6 (SD = 1.5, Range = 16-21). The quantitative findings suggest that the acceptability of S4E is high, as indicated by the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (mean score = 25.2, SD: 4.8). Immediately post-intervention, all youth who reported past 90-day condomless sex or having never been tested for STIs or HIV in their lifetime, were tested for both STIs and HIV. Qualitative themes revealed four overarching themes, including S4E: (1) faciliated timely, targeted, and tailored prevention and risk reduction strategies; (2) shaped clinician and youth communication and interaction during the clinic visit; (3) may have improved uptake of STI/HIV testing and increased STI/HIV knowledge and self-efficacy; and (4) had high feasibiliy and acceptability among youth and clninicans.
   Conclusions
   Findings suggest the feasibility and acceptability of S4E in an urban community-based health clinic setting. A next important step is to examine the efficacy of S4E in a randomized controlled trial design.

AB Key to scientific integrity is ensuring that research findings are considered credible by scientific peers, practitioners, policymakers and the public. Industry sponsorship of nutritional research can result in bias and raises significant professional, public and media concern. Yet, there is no international consensus on how to prevent or manage conflicts of interest for researchers considering engaging with the food industry. This study aimed to determine internationally agreed principles to guide interactions between population health researchers and the food industry to prevent or manage conflicts of interest. We used a two-stage, online Delphi study for researchers (n = 100 in 28 countries), and an online survey for stakeholders (n = 84 in 26 countries). Levels of agreement were sought with 56 principles derived from a systematic review. Respondent comments were analysed using qualitative content analysis. High levels of agreement on principles were achieved for both groups (researchers 68%; stakeholders 65%). Highest levels of agreement were with principles concerning research methods and governance. More contentious were principles that required values based decision-making, such as determining which elements of the commercial sector are acceptable to interact with. These results provide the basis for developing internationally agreed guidelines for population health researchers governing interactions with the food industry.

AB Background
   Although breast Self-Examination is no longer tenable as a standard method to detect early breast cancer, world health organization recommends breast self-examination for raising awareness of women about breast cancer. Secondary prevention through monthly breast self-examination is the best option to tackle the rising incidence of breast cancer. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess breast self -examination practice and associated factors.
   Methods
   This cross-sectional study was conducted from April 23 to May 23, 2018. A total of 421 female workers in Debre Tabor Town public health facilities were included. The study participants were selected using simple random sampling technique from the study population. The collected data were checked for completeness. The data were entered and cleaned using EpiData version 3.1 then exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Crude odd ratio and probability value were identified for each independent variable and all independent variables with probability value of less than 0.2 were entered into multivariables logistic regression. Statistically significant associated factors were identified based on probability value (p-value) less than 0.05 and adjusted odd ratio with 95% confidence interval.
   Result
   The mean age of participants was 25.2 (S.D = 4.12) and 137 (32.5%) of the participants had practiced breast self-examination and 64 (15.2%) of them performed it monthly. Family history of breast cancer (adjusted OR = 6.5, CI = 1.54-21.4), Knowledge about breast -self examination (adjusted OR = 5.74, CI = 2.3-14.4) and self- efficacy in practicing breast self -examination (adjusted OR = 4.7, CI = 1.84-12.11) were significantly associated with breast self-examination practice.
   Conclusions
   The study showed that the prevalence of breast self-examination was low. Family history of breast cancer, knowledge about breast self-examination and self- efficacy in practicing breast self-examination did have statistically significant association with breast self examination practice.

AB Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer. Owing to the incorporation of risk-adapted therapy and the arrival of new directed agents, the cure rate and survival of patients with ALL have improved dramatically, get near to 90%. In Latin American countries, the mortality rates of ALL are high, for example in Colombia, during the last decade, ALL has been the most prevalent cancer among children between 0-14 years of age. In the face of this public health problem and coupled with the fact that the knowledge of the proteome of the child population is little, our investigation proposes the study of the plasma proteome of Colombian children diagnosed with B-cell ALL (B-ALL) to determine potential disease markers that could reflect processes altered by the presence of the disease or in response to it. A proteomic study by LC-MS/MS and quantification by label-free methods were performed in search of proteins differentially expressed between healthy children and those diagnosed with B-ALL. We quantified a total of 472 proteins in depleted blood plasma, and 25 of these proteins were differentially expressed (fold change >2, Bonferroni-adjusted P-values <0.05). Plasma Aggrecan core protein, alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, coagulation factor XIII A chain and gelsolin protein were examined by ELISA assay and compared to shotgun proteomics results. Our data provide new information on the plasma proteome of Colombian children. Additionally, these proteins may also have certain potential as illness markers or as therapeutic targets in subsequent investigations.

AB Background
   Alcohol use and abuse constitute a major public health problem and identifying their determinants is a priority. Social network analysis can indicate how characteristics of social networks are related to individual health behaviors. A growing number of studies have used social network analysis to examine how social network characteristics influence adult alcohol consumption, but this literature has never been systematically reviewed and summarized. The current paper systematically reviews empirical studies that used social network analysis to assess the influence of social network characteristics on drinking behaviors in adults.
   Methods
   A literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases and a review of the reference lists of retrieved articles was conducted in March 2019. Two reviewers independently screened 5,510 non-duplicate records, and further screened the full text of 150 articles to determine their eligibility for inclusion. Seventeen articles were judged eligible and included.
   Results
   Most studies were conducted among young adults (mean age<30), in university settings or follow up visits with adolescent networks moving into adulthood. The objectives and methods of the included studies were heterogeneous. All included studies reported a statistically significant association between a social network characteristic and an alcohol consumption-related outcome. Social network members drinking behaviors were associated with participants' drinking behaviors in multiple ways.
   Discussion
   In young adults, among whom the majority of identified studies were conducted, with whom they socialize and how they socialize appears to be associated with alcohol consumption; this was observed across methodologies and settings. We still know very little about the relationship of social networks to drinking in older age groups, and in populations most impacted by alcohol. As social networks appear to play a role in the consumption of alcohol in young adulthood, interventions that utilize social networks to help reduce harmful alcohol consumption should be considered.

AB Spatial accessibility to health services is a key factor in terms of public health. Even though some tools are available, establishing accessibility criteria applicable from one geographic scale to another remains difficult. Therefore, we propose a method for creating a health accessibility index applicable on a large geographic scale, based on a methodology that overcomes the limitations of political-administrative divisions and which allows a multi-scalar approach to be implemented. The index highlights, on a national scale, areas of cumulative health disadvantages. This index of accessibility to health care combines accessibility and availability and can be adapted to many geographical scales. As accessibility can be understood in various dimensions, a score could be calculated for various fields such as education and culture. The index can help policymakers to identify under-endowed areas and find optimal locations. In terms of public health, it may be used to understand the mechanisms underlying geographic health disparities.

AB Viral hepatitis, syphilis, HIV, and tuberculosis infections in prisons have been identified globally as a public health problem. Tuberculosis (TB) and viral hepatitis co-infection may increase the risk of anti-tuberculosis treatment-induced hepatotoxicity, leading to the frequent cause of discontinuation of the first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. Therefore, the aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the epidemiological features of HCV, HBV, syphilis and HIV infections among bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis prisoners in Campo Grande (MS), Central Brazil. The participants who agreed to participate (n = 279) were interviewed and tested for the presence of active or current HCV, HBV, syphilis and HIV infections. The prevalence of HCV exposure was 4.7% (13/279; 95% CI 2.2-7.1). HCV RNA was detected in 84.6% (11/13) of anti-HCV positive samples. Out of 279 participants, 19 (6.8%; 95% CI 4.4-10.4) were HIV co-infected, 1.4% (4/279, 95% CI 0.5-3.8) had chronic hepatitis B virus (HBsAg positive) and 9.3% (26/279, 95% CI 6.4-13.4) had serological marker of exposure to hepatitis B virus (total anti-HBc positive). The prevalence of lifetime syphilis infection (anti-T. pallidum positive) was 10% (28/279, 95% CI 7.0-14.2) and active syphilis (VDRL >= 1/8 titre) was 5% (14/279, 95% CI 2.9-8.3). The prevalence of TB/HCV co-infection among prisoners with HIV (15.8%) was higher than among HIV-non-infected prisoners (3.8%; P<0.05). These results highlight the importance of hepatitis testing among prisoners with bacteriologically confirmed case of TB who can be more effectively and safely treated in order to reduce the side effects of hepatotoxic anti-TB drugs.

AB Candidemia has been considered a persistent public health problem with great impact on hospital costs and high mortality. We aimed to evaluate the epidemiology and prognostic factors of candidemia in a tertiary hospital in Northeast Brazil from January 2011 to December 2016. Demographic and clinical data of patients were retrospectively obtained from medical records and antifungal susceptibility profiling was performed using the broth micro dilution method. A total of 68 episodes of candidemia were evaluated. We found an average incidence of 2.23 episodes/1000 admissions and a 30-day mortality rate of 55.9%. The most prevalent species were Candida albicans (35.3%), Candida tropicalis (27.4%), Candida parapsilosis (21.6%) and Candida glabrata (11.8%). Higher mortality rates were observed in cases of candidemia due to C. albicans (61.1%) and C. glabrata (100%), especially when compared to C. parapsilosis (27.3%). Univariate analysis revealed some variables which significantly increased the probability of death: older age (P = 0.022; odds ratio [OR] = 1.041), severe sepsis (P < 0.001; OR = 8.571), septic shock (P = 0.035; OR = 3.792), hypotension (P = 0.003; OR = 9.120), neutrophilia (P = 0.046; OR = 3.080), thrombocytopenia (P = 0.002; OR = 6.800), mechanical ventilation (P = 0.009; OR = 8.167) and greater number of surgeries (P = 0.037; OR = 1.920). Multivariate analysis showed that older age (P = 0.040; OR = 1.055), severe sepsis (P = 0.009; OR = 9.872) and hypotension (P = 0.031; OR = 21.042) were independently associated with worse prognosis. There was no resistance to amphotericin B, micafungin or itraconazole and a low rate of resistance to fluconazole (5.1%). However, 20.5% of the Candida isolates were susceptible dose-dependent (SDD) to fluconazole and 7.7% to itraconazole. In conclusion, our results could assist in the adoption of strategies to stratify patients at higher risk for developing candidemia and worse prognosis, in addition to improve antifungal management.

AB Background Numerous studies of dental antibiotic prescribing show that overprescribing is a worldwide occurrence. The aim of this study was to assess prescribing practices of general dentists in Australia for antibiotics, analgesics and anxiolytics and to determine the extent to which prescribing is in accordance with current guidelines. Methods A structured questionnaire was sent to 1468 dentists in Victoria and Queensland in July-August 2018. The questionnaire covered demographics, clinical conditions where dentists prescribe antibiotics, non-clinical factors which influence prescribing, and medicines for anxiolysis and pain relief. Responses were scored using a system based on the current Australian therapeutic guidelines. Logistic regression was used to determine the relative importance of independent variables on inappropriate prescribing. Results Three hundred eighty-two responses were received. Overall, 55% of overprescribing of antibiotics was detected, with a range of 13-88% on a routine or occasional basis depending on the scenario. Between 16 and 27% of respondents inappropriately preferenced analgesics over anti-inflammatories for dental pain; 46% of those who prescribed anxiolytic medicines did so inappropriately, with varying regimens and choices outside the guidelines. Years of practice was the main demographic factor influencing prescribing, with recent graduates (0-5 years) generally scoring better than their colleagues for antibiotic prescribing (p < 0.05). Conclusions Future interventions could be directed towards the appropriate role and use of antibiotics, shortfalls in knowledge and appropriate choices of medicines for pain relief and anxiolysis. Given that the most overprescribing occurred for localised swellings (88%), this area could be focused on in continuing education as well as ensuring it is addressed in undergraduate teaching. Continuing education on the appropriate use of medicines can be targeted at more experienced dentists as well as patients, especially those who expect antibiotics instead of treatment.

AB Background Samoa is suffering from alarming rates of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). To address this epidemic, tackling health literacy is important. A qualitative study was conducted with the aim to explore health literacy in Samoa in relation to NCDs. Methods Six focus groups were conducted, with a total sample size of 73 participants aged over 18 years. The semi-structured interview guide was based on the conceptual model of the European Health Literacy project (HLS-EU). Data was translated, transcribed, coded, and categorized as part of the qualitative analysis. Results The analysis resulted in one overarching category and seven sub-categories based on 19 themes. It revealed that health literacy in Samoa is strongly influenced by the culture. Personal responsibility is lacking. The family circle is central to health in a community where support is provided through the church and local groupings. Basic knowledge of NCDs was present in the population, but a deeper understanding of chronic disease implications was lacking. Difficulties with regards to medication adherence for chronic diseases arose as a topic, and traditional healers are still strongly embedded in the local society. Finally, the health system's performance, especially primary care services at the local level, is suffering from the high burden of NCDs and has been challenged to respond to the needs of the community it serves. Conclusion The findings of this study show how health literacy in Samoa is influenced by culture and suggest employing participatory, culture-sensitive, public health interventions which address the family as a whole, building on health literacy to address major public health problems like NCDs and remove barriers in the health system.

AB Background Maternal exposure to socioeconomic disadvantage increases the risk of child injuries and subsequent child developmental and mental health problems - particularly for young mothers. To inform early intervention planning, this research therefore aimed to describe the health and social adversities experienced by a cohort of girls and young women in early pregnancy in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Methods Participants were recruited for the BC Healthy Connections Project (BCHCP), a randomized controlled trial examining the effectiveness of Nurse-Family Partnership, a home visitation program, in improving child and maternal outcomes. Baseline data were collected from 739 participants on trial entry. Participants were selected on the basis of preparing to parent for the first time and experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage. Analyses involved descriptive statistics and age-group comparisons. Results Most participants reported having low income (84%), having limited education (52%) and being single (91%) at trial entry. Beyond these eligibility criteria, other health and social adversities included: housing instability (52%); severe anxiety or depression (47%); other diagnosed mental disorders (22%); prenatal nicotine and cannabis use (27 and 21%); physical health problems (20%); child maltreatment when younger (56%); and intimate partner violence recently (50%). As well, few (29%) had received income assistance entitlements. More than two thirds (70%) were experiencing four or more forms of adversity. Age-group differences were observed for cognitive functioning, being single, low income, limited education, psychological distress and service use (p-value <= 0.05). Conclusions This cohort was selected on the basis of socioeconomic disadvantage. Yet all participants were experiencing substantial added adversities - at higher rates than other Canadians. Furthermore, despite Canada's public programs, these pregnant girls and young women were not being adequately reached by social services. Our study adds new data to inform early intervention planning, suggesting that unacceptably high levels of socioeconomic disadvantage exist for some young British Columbians. Therefore greater health and social supports and services are warranted for these young mothers and their children.

ID INDUSTRY; FOOD
AB Background In 1976, the U.S. Sugar Association (SA), a globally networked trade organization representing the cane and beet sugar industry, won the Public Relations Society of America's (PRSA) Silver Anvil Award for a crisis communication campaign. Their campaign successfully limited the diffusion of sugar restriction policies to control obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and dental caries, and marked the beginning of the modern-day SA. The sugar industry continues to resist measures to reduce sugar consumption, therefore understanding and addressing industry opposition is crucial to achieving global targets to reduce non-communicable disease. Methods We critically analyze common crisis management rhetorical strategies used by SA to defend itself from perceived wrongdoing, and sugar from perceptions of harm using a thematic content analysis based on Hearit's Corporate Apologia theory. Data sources were internal SA documents related to the 1976 Silver Anvil Award in 1) PRSA records, 2) Great Western Sugar Company records, and 3) William Jefferson Darby Papers. Results SA, using prototypical apologia stances (counterattack, differentiation, apology, and corrective action) and rhetorical dissociation strategies (appearance/reality, opinion/knowledge, and act/essence) constructed a persuasive narrative to successfully defend sugar from a product safety crisis, and the sugar industry from a social legitimacy crisis. SA's overarching narrative was that restricting sugar, which it claimed was a valuable food that makes healthy foods more palatable, would cause harm and that claims to the contrary were made by opportunists, pseudoscientists, food-faddists, lay nutritionists or those who had been misled by them. SA's apologia does not meet criteria for truthfulness or sincerity. Conclusion Corporate apologia theory provides an accessible way of understanding sugar industry crisis communication strategies. It enables public health actors to recognize and predict industry corporate apologia in response to ongoing product safety and social legitimacy challenges. Industry counterarguments can be examined for truthfulness and sincerity (or the lack thereof), and explained to policymakers considering sugar restriction policies, and to the public, thereby decreasing the effectiveness of illegitimate industry communication efforts to oppose regulation and legislation.

AB Background Choking is one of the leading causes of death among unintentional injuries in young children. Food choking represents a considerable public health burden, which might be reduced through increased effective preventative education programs. We present a protocol for a community intervention trial termed CHOP (CHOking Prevention project) that aimed to teach Italian families how to prevent food choking injuries and increase knowledge relating to nutrition. Methods Italian educational facilities were enrolled. Stratified randomization blocked by geographical area was performed. Each stratum was randomized to one of three different intervention strategies or to a control group. Educational intervention was delivered in the schools by experts and certified trainers as per the following three intervention strategies: directly to families (Strategy A); to teaching staff only, who subsequently delivered the same educational intervention to families (Strategy B); to health service staff only, who then delivered the educational intervention to teaching staff, who subsequently delivered the intervention to families (Strategy C). Participants completed a questionnaire about their knowledge on the topics presented during the educational interventions (pre-, post-, and follow-up of intervention). Information from the questionnaires was synthetized into 6 indicators in order to measure how effective each intervention strategy was. Discussion The issue of food choking injuries in children is relevant to public health. The protocol we present provides an opportunity to progress towards overcoming such challenges through a working model that can be implemented also in other countries.

AB Background The NHS Health Check (NHS HC) is a cardiovascular risk assessment to prevent cardiovascular disease. Public Health England (PHE) wants to increase uptake. Methods We explored the impact of behaviourally informed invitation letters and pre-notification and reminder SMS on uptake of NHS HCs. Patients at 28 General Practices in the London Borough of Southwark who were eligible to receive an NHS HC between 1st November 2013 and 31st December 2014 were included. A double-blind randomised controlled trial with a mixed 2 (pre-notification SMS - yes or no) x 4 (letter - national template control, open-ended, time-limited, social norm) x 2 (reminder SMS - yes or no) factorial design was used. The open-ended letter used simplification, behavioural instruction and a personalised planning prompt for patients to record the date and time of their NHS HC. The time-limited letter was similar but stated the NHS HC was due in a named forthcoming month. The social norms letter was similar to the open-ended letter but included a descriptive social norms message and testimonials from local residents and no planning prompt. The outcome measure was attendance at an NHS HC. Results Data for 12, 244 invites were analysed. Uptake increased in almost all letter and SMS combinations compared to the control letter without SMS (Uptake 18%), with increases of up to 12 percentage points for the time-limited letter with pre-notification and reminder (Uptake 30%; Adjusted Odds Ratio AOR 1.86; 95% CI 1.45-2.83; p < 0.00); 10 percentage points for the open-ended letter with reminder (Uptake 27%; AOR 1.68; 95% CI 1.31-2.17; p < 0.00) and a 9 percentage point increase using the time-limited letter with reminder (Uptake 27%; AOR 1.61; 95% CI 1.25-2.10; p < 0.00). The reminder SMS increased uptake for all intervention letters. The pre-notification did not add to this effect. Conclusions This large randomised controlled trial adds support to the evidence that small, low cost behaviourally informed changes to letter-based invitations can increase uptake of NHS HCs. It also provides novel evidence on the effect of SMS reminders and pre-notification on NHS HC attendance.

AB BackgroundSimple phenomenological growth models can be useful for estimating transmission parameters and forecasting epidemic trajectories. However, most existing phenomenological growth models only support single-peak outbreak dynamics whereas real epidemics often display more complex transmission trajectories.MethodsWe develop and apply a novel sub-epidemic modeling framework that supports a diversity of epidemic trajectories including stable incidence patterns with sustained or damped oscillations to better understand and forecast epidemic outbreaks. We describe how to forecast an epidemic based on the premise that the observed coarse-scale incidence can be decomposed into overlapping sub-epidemics at finer scales. We evaluate our modeling framework using three outbreak datasets: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Singapore, plague in Madagascar, and the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and four performance metrics.ResultsThe sub-epidemic wave model outperforms simpler growth models in short-term forecasts based on performance metrics that account for the uncertainty of the predictions namely the mean interval score (MIS) and the coverage of the 95% prediction interval. For example, we demonstrate how the sub-epidemic wave model successfully captures the 2-peak pattern of the SARS outbreak in Singapore. Moreover, in short-term sequential forecasts, the sub-epidemic model was able to forecast the second surge in case incidence for this outbreak, which was not possible using the simple growth models. Furthermore, our findings support the view that the national incidence curve of the Ebola epidemic in DRC follows a stable incidence pattern with periodic behavior that can be decomposed into overlapping sub-epidemics.ConclusionsOur findings highlight how overlapping sub-epidemics can capture complex epidemic dynamics, including oscillatory behavior in the trajectory of the epidemic wave. This observation has significant implications for interpreting apparent noise in incidence data where the oscillations could be dismissed as a result of overdispersion, rather than an intrinsic part of the epidemic dynamics. Unless the oscillations are appropriately modeled, they could also give a false positive, or negative, impression of the impact from public health interventions. These preliminary results using sub-epidemic models can help guide future efforts to better understand the heterogenous spatial and social factors shaping sub-epidemic patterns for other infectious diseases.

AB Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a widespread public health problem and a signature injury of our military in modern conflicts. Despite the long-term effects of even mild brain injuries, an effective treatment remains elusive. Coffee and several of its compounds, including caffeine, have been identified as having neuroprotective effects in studies of neurodegenerative disease. Given the molecular similarities between TBI and neurodegenerative disease, we have devised a study to test a nanocoffee extract in the treatment of a mouse model of mild TBI. Results After a single injury and two subsequent injections of nanocoffee, we identified treatment as being associated with improved behavioral outcomes, favorable molecular signaling changes, and dendritic changes suggestive of improved neuronal health. Conclusions We have identified coffee extracts as a potential viable multifaceted treatment approach to target the secondary injury associated with TBI.

TI Out-of-pocket payment for primary healthcare in the era of national
   health insurance: Evidence from northern Ghana
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; SCHEME; MALARIA
AB Background
   Ghana introduced a national health insurance program in 2005 with the goal of removing user fees, popularly called "cash and carry", along with their associated catastrophic and impoverishment effects on the population and ensuring access to equitable health care. However, after a decade of implementation, the impact of this program on user fees and out-of-pocket payment (OOP) is not properly documented. This paper contributes to understanding the impact of Ghana's health insurance program on out-of-pocket healthcare payments and the factors associated with the level of out-of-pocket payments for primary healthcare in a predominantly rural region of Ghana.
   Methods
   Using a five-year panel data of revenues accruing to public primary health facilities in seven districts, We employed mean comparison tests (t-test) to examine the trend in revenues accruing from out-of-pocket payments vis-a-vis health insurance claims for health services, medication, and obstetric care. Furthermore, generalized estimation equation regression models were used to assess the relationship between explanatory variables and the level of out-of-pocket payments and health insurance claims.
   Results
   Out-of-pocket payment for health services and medications declined by 63% and 62% respectively between 2010 and 2014. Insurance claims however increased by 16% within the same period. There was statistically a significant mean reduction in out-of-pocket payment over the period. Factors significantly associated with out-of-pocket payments in a given district are the number of community health facilities, availability of a district hospital and the year of observation.
   Conclusion
   The study provides evidence that Ghana's national health insurance program is significantly contributing to a reduction in out-of-pocket payment for primary healthcare in public health facilities. Efforts should therefore be put in place to ensure the sustainability of this policy as a major pathway for achieving universal health coverage in Ghana.

TI Obesity stigma in Germany and the United States - Results of population
   surveys
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID WEIGHT STIGMA; OVERWEIGHT; BIAS; DISCRIMINATION; ASSOCIATIONS; ADULTS;
   IMPACT
AB Introduction
   Over the past decades, obesity stigma has become a substantial public health issue as studies have highlighted its negative consequences for mental and physical health. However, comparative studies are scarce. In this cross-national study, we focus on the following research questions: (1) Are there differences in the magnitude of public obesity stigma between Germany and the United States (US), and (2) are there differences in the associations of sociodemographic as well as experience (i.e. former obesity experience) and contact-related (i.e. contact to a person with obesity) factors with public obesity stigma between these two countries?
   Material and methods
   National telephone surveys in Germany and the United States were conducted (total sample = 2,802) by using vignettes for the description of a person with obesity. Fat Phobia Scale, negative reactions, and desire for social distance were assessed as components of public obesity stigma. All three stigma components were examined with multilevel linear regression analyses.
   Results
   Overall, results show that public obesity stigma is significantly more pronounced in the US than in Germany. Relationships between obesity stigma and sociodemographic as well as experience and contact-related factors remain rather inconclusive, though, in general, stronger associations are shown in the US.
   Conclusions
   Contrary to the normalization hypothesis, findings indicate that a comparatively high prevalence of obesity like in the US is associated with a higher level of obesity stigma.

TI Public preferences for corporate social responsibility activities in the
   pharmaceutical industry: Empirical evidence from Korea
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID IMPACT; FIRM; CSR
AB Although corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities are common in the pharmaceutical industry, there is little empirical evidence on consumer responses to CSR practices. We investigated public awareness, preferences, and expectations regarding social contribution of the pharmaceutical industry's CSR activities, and identified the factors associated with such activities. We conducted an online survey with 1,298 respondents comprising two groups: healthy individuals (546) and patients (752). Most respondents (78%) expressed interest in CSR activities undertaken by pharmaceutical companies. However, they reported a lack of awareness and experience thereof; only 26.9% were aware of and 7.9% had experience with such activities. Among our six CSR activity categories, both survey groups showed the highest preference for the "promoting public health" (healthy group: 6.34/10; patient group: 6.37/10) and "emergency disaster relief support" (6.31 and 6.35) categories. Among sub-categories, activities related to "development of innovative drugs in untreated areas" (6.63 and 6.82) and "support for research on new drug development" (6.59 and 6.84) received the highest scores. The mean expectation score of social contribution of all CSR activities was slightly higher than the mean preference score (6.37 and 6.06, respectively). The patient group exhibited a larger difference between the highest and lowest expectation scores than the healthy group (1.11 and 0.64, respectively). The results of the regression analysis revealed that being a patient, being male, and having positive attitudes toward CSR and its expected effects significantly and positively affected public preferences regarding CSR activities. We can conclude that CSR activities with high public preference might be an effective strategy to improve public awareness of the pharmaceutical industry's CSR activities. Furthermore, the highest preference for CSR activities relates to new drug development, indicating that our society believes the pharmaceutical industry's key CSR activity should be to pursue its intrinsic mission: to fulfill unmet medical needs by developing new drugs.

TI Performance of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis indirect adherence measures

   PrEP Brasil Study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article

   CONCORDANCE; SYSTEM; RISK
AB Introduction
   Efficacy of daily emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) for PrEP is strongly dependent on the adherence. We examined the concordance between indirect adherence measures and protective drug levels among participants retained through 48 weeks in the PrEP Brasil Study.
   Methods
   PrEP Brasil was a prospective, multicenter, open-label demonstration project evaluating PrEP provision for men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) at higher risk for HIV infection within the setting of Brazilian Public Health System. Three indirect adherence measures were obtained at week 48: medication possession ratio (MPR), pill count and self-report (30-days recall). Tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) concentration in Dried Blood Spot (DBS) was measured at week 48. Areas under (AUC) the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve were used to evaluate the concordance between achieving protective drug levels (TFV-DP >= 700fmol/punch) and the indirect adherence measures. Youden's index and distance to corner were used to determine the optimal cutoff points for each indirect adherence measure. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, negative (NPV) and positive (PPV) predictive values for the found cutoff points. Finally, Delong test was used to compare AUCs.
   Results and discussion
   From April, 2014 to July, 2016, 450 participants initiated PrEP, 375(83.3%) were retained through 48 weeks. Of these, 74% (277/375) had TFV-DP >= 700fmol/punch. All adherence measures discriminated between participants with and without protective drug levels (AUC>0.5). High indirect adherence measure was predictive of protective drug levels (PPV>0.8) while low indirect adherence measure was not predictive of lack of protective drug levels (NPV<0.5). No significant differences were found between the adherence methods (p = 0.44).
   Conclusions
   Low-burden measurements such as MPR and self-report can be used to predict PrEP adherence in a public health context in Brazil for MSM and TGW retained through 48 weeks.

TI Knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding rabies and its control
   among dog owners in Kigali city, Rwanda
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; AWARENESS; COMMUNITY
AB Background
   Rabies is a zoonotic viral disease that can occur in all warm-blooded animals, including humans. Vaccinating dogs can protect people from contracting rabies. Rabies is a public health threat in Rwanda, but the country does not have information on the epidemiology of rabies. The present study aimed to understand the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of rabies and its control among dog owners in Kigali city of Rwanda.
   Methods
   We conducted a cross-sectional survey using a structured questionnaire among 137 dog owners selected from nine administrative study sites. A two-stage random sampling procedure was used to select the participants. Frequency distributions analysis and a series of chi-square tests of associations as well as binary logistic regressions were performed to determine the important factors associated with the response variables.
   Results
   The results showed that 99.5% of respondents knew at least a host susceptible to rabies. Only 22.4% and 21.3% knew that dogs and people can develop rabies, respectively. Nearly 73.6% knew that human rabies can be transmitted through dog-bites and 99% could identify at least a clinical sign of canine rabies. Overall, 81.8% knew that regular vaccination of dogs helps to prevent dog-transmitted human rabies and 43.1% and 26.3% were aware that rabies in humans and in dogs are fatal once clinical symptoms have shown, respectively. Only 69% would observe a dog for 10 days after it bites a man or an animal. Approximately 20.4% were familiar with appropriate cleaning of dog-bites wounds, and 20.6% knew that puppies could receive rabies vaccination before they are three months old. Of those who owned vaccinated dogs, 78% were happy about the cost (US $ <= 34) of rabies vaccination. Of all the respondents, 58% had their dogs vaccinated at home by veterinarians while 86% indicated their veterinarians kept rabies vaccines on ice in a cool box. Overall, 53% of the dog owners had sufficient knowledge of rabies, whilst 66% and 17% adopted adequate practices and positive attitudes towards rabies, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analyses indicated that none of the respondents' sex, educational level, and the length of dog ownership were statistically associated with their knowledge, attitudes and practices of rabies.
   Conclusions
   This study showed that majority of the dog owners had sufficient knowledge and adopted appropriate practices of rabies. However there exist some knowledge gaps among the dog owners particularly on treatment, transmission and control methods. Therefore, rabies awareness campaign is required to upgrade rabies knowledge of the dog owners on rabies prevention and control in Rwanda.

TI Disparities in surgical care for children across Brazil: Use of
   geospatial analysis
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH; SURGERY; ACCESS
AB Background
   Health systems for surgical care for children in low- and middle-income countries remain poorly understood. Our goal was to characterize the delivery of surgical care for children across Brazil and to identify associations between surgical resources and childhood mortality.
   Methods
   We performed a cross-sectional, ecological study to analyze surgical care for children in the public health system (Sistema Unico de Saude) across Brazil from 2010 to 2015. We collected data from several national databases, and used geospatial analysis (two-step floating catchment, Getis-Ord-Gi analysis, and geographically weighted regression) to explore relationships between infrastructure, workforce, access, procedure rate, under-5 mortality rate (U5MR), and perioperative mortality rate (POMR).
   Results
   A total of 246,769 surgical procedures were performed in 6,007 first level/district hospitals and 491 referral hospitals across Brazil over the study period. The surgical workforce is distributed unevenly across the country, with 0.13-0.26 pediatric surgeons per 100,000 children in the poorer North, Northeast and Midwest regions, and 0.6-0.68 pediatric surgeons per 100,000 children in the wealthier South and Southeast regions. Hospital infrastructure, procedure rate, and access to care is also unequally distributed across the country, with increased resources in the South and Southeast compared to the Northeast, North, and Midwest. The U5MR varies widely across the country, although procedure-specific POMR is consistent across regions. Increased access to care is associated with lower U5MR across Brazil, and access to surgical care differs by geographic region independent of socioeconomic status.
   Conclusions
   There are wide disparities in surgical care for children across Brazil, with infrastructure, manpower, and resources distributed unevenly across the country. Access to surgical care is associated with improved U5MR independent of socioeconomic status. To address these disparities, policy should direct the allocation of surgical resources commensurate with local population needs.

AB Background Studies in high-income countries have reported associations between oral health and diabetes. There is however a lack of evidence on this association from low and middle-income countries, especially India. The current study aimed to assess the prevalence of common oral diseases and their association with diabetes. Methods This cross-sectional study was nested within the second Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia Surveillance Study. A subset of study participants residing in Delhi were administered the World Health Organization's Oral Health Assessment Questionnaire and underwent oral examination for caries experience and periodontal health assessment using standard indices. Diabetes status was ascertained by fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin values or self-reported medication use. Information was captured on co-variates of interest. The association between oral health and diabetes was investigated using Multivariable Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression analysis. Results Out of 2045 participants, 47% were women and the mean age of study participants was 42.17 (12.8) years. The age-standardised prevalence (95% confidence interval) estimates were 78.9% (75.6-81.7) for dental caries, 35.9% (32.3-39.6) for periodontitis. Nearly 85% participants suffered from at least one oral disease. Compared to diabetes-free counterparts, participants with diabetes had more severe caries experience [Mean Count Ratio (MCR) = 1.07 (1.03-1.12)] and attachment loss [MCR = 1.10 (1.04-1.17)]. Also, the adjusted prevalence of periodontitis was significantly higher among participants with diabetes [42.3%(40.0-45.0)] compared to those without diabetes [31.3%(30.3-32.2)]. Conclusion We found that eight out of ten participants in urban Delhi suffered from some form of oral disease and participants with diabetes had worse oral health. This highlights the need for public health strategies to integrate oral health within the existing Non-Communicable Disease control programs.

TI Low colorectal cancer survival in the Mountain West state of Nevada: A

AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third greatest cancer burden in the United States. The remarkably diverse Mountain West state of Nevada has uncharacteristically high CRC mortality compared to other Western states. We aimed to study the determinants of the CRC excess burden by using data from the Nevada Central Cancer Registry from 2003-2013. Five-year cause-specific age-adjusted survival from colorectal cancer was calculated and stratified by sex, race/ethnicity and region of Nevada. Cox Proportional Hazards regression modelling was used to study the impact of demographic, social, and clinical factors on CRC survival in Nevada, assessing follow-up as accurately as possible. The extent to which differences in survival can be explained by receipt of stage-appropriate treatment was also assessed. 12,413 CRC cases from 2003-2013 in Nevada were analyzed. Five-year CRC survival was low: 56.0% (95% CI: 54.6-57.5) among males and 59.5% (95% CI: 58.0-61.1) among females; significantly lower than national 5-year survival of 65.1% and 66.5%, respectively. Low survival was driven by populous Southern Nevada; after adjustment for all covariates, Southern Nevadans were at 17% higher risk of death than their counterparts in Northwestern Nevada (HR:1.17; 95% CI:1.08-1.27). Many patients did not receive stage-appropriate treatment, although this only partly explained the poor survival, uniformly low for every race/ethnicity in Nevada. The observed disparity for this one state within a single nation merits public health attention; regardless of the state or region of residence, all Americans deserve equal opportunity for optimum health outcomes in the face of a cancer diagnosis. The current study provides baseline information critical to clinicians, public health professionals, and all relevant stakeholders as they attempt to discern why Nevada's outcomes are vastly divergent from its neighboring Western states and make plans for remediation.

AB Background
   Despite increasing global attention to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and their incorporation into universal health coverage (UHC), the factors that determine whether and how NCDs are prioritized in national health agendas and integrated into health systems remain poorly understood. Childhood cancer is a leading non-communicable cause of death in children aged 0-14 years worldwide. We investigated the political, social, and economic factors that influence health system priority-setting on childhood cancer care in a range of low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).
   Methods and findings
   Based on in-depth qualitative case studies, we analyzed the determinants of priority-setting for childhood cancer care in El Salvador, Guatemala, Ghana, India, and the Philippines using a conceptual framework that considers four principal influences on political prioritization: political contexts, actor power, ideas, and issue characteristics. Data for the analysis derived from in-depth interviews (n = 68) with key informants involved in or impacted by childhood cancer policies and programs in participating countries, supplemented by published academic literature and available policy documents.
   Political priority for childhood cancer varies widely across the countries studied and is most influenced by political context and actor power dynamics. Ghana has placed relatively little national priority on childhood cancer, largely due to competing priorities and a lack of cohesion among stakeholders. In both El Salvador and Guatemala, actor power has played a central role in generating national priority for childhood cancer, where well-organized and -resourced civil society organizations have disrupted legacies of fragmented governance and financing to create priority for childhood cancer care. In India, the role of a uniquely empowered private actor was instrumental in creating political priority and establishing sustained channels of financing for childhood cancer care. In the Philippines, the childhood cancer community has capitalized on a window of opportunity to expand access and reduce disparities in childhood cancer care through the political prioritization of UHC and NCDs in current health system reforms.
   Conclusions
   The importance of key health system actors in determining the relative political priority for childhood cancer in the countries studied points to actor power as a critical enabler of prioritization in other LMIC. Responsiveness to political contexts-in particular, rhetorical and policy priority placed on NCDs and UHC-will be crucial to efforts to place childhood cancer firmly on national health agendas. National governments must be convinced of the potential for foundational health system strengthening through attention to childhood cancer care, and the presence and capability of networked actors primed to amplify public sector investments and catalyze change on the ground.

TI A comparison of opioids and benzodiazepines dispensing in Australia
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID DRUG-MONITORING PROGRAM; PAIN; MISUSE; ABUSE
AB Background
   Inappropriate utilization of prescription opioids and benzodiazepines is a public health problem. This study examined and compared user-types and trends in dispensing of these medicines, and identified associated factors related to the duration of dispensing in Australia.
   Methods
   A random 10% sample of unit-record data of opioids and benzodiazepines dispensed nationally during 2013-2016 was analyzed. Users were categorized into four types: single quarter (i.e., three months), medium-episodic (dispensed 2-6 quarters), long-episodic (dispensed 7-11 quarters), chronic (dispensed 12-16 quarters). Dispensing quantity was computed in defined daily dose (DDD). Generalized multilevel ordinal models were developed to examine the factors associated with the duration of dispensing.
   Results
   There were similarities in terms of trends of dispensing of opioids and benzodiazepines in Australia. Overall, more people were dispensed opioids than benzodiazepines. Around 52% of opioids users and 46% of benzodiazepines users were dispensed these medicines for a single quarter. However, chronic users were dispensed 60% of opioids and 50% of benzodiazepines in DDD/1000 people/day, respectively. On average, 16.6 DDD/1000 people/day of opioids and 14.2 DDD/1000 people/day of benzodiazepines were dispensed in Australia during the study period. Tasmania was dispensed the highest quantity (in DDD/1000 people/day) of these medicines, followed by South Australia and Queensland. Women compared to men, and clients of age-group 20-44, 45-64 and 65+ compared to age-group 0-19, were significantly more likely to have dispensed opioids/benzodiazepine for a relatively long duration. Clients with a history of dispensing of one of these two medicines were significantly more likely to have dispensed the other for a relatively long period.
   Conclusions
   There were similarities in patterns of dispensing of opioids and benzodiazepines in terms of user characteristics and structural variables. Consistent use of real-time drug monitoring program and tailored intervention are recommended.

AB Background Worldwide, HIV remains a major public health challenge, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Literature indicates that men's involvement in HIV testing, care, and treatment services is lower compared to women, therefore novel approaches are required to engage men in the cascade of HIV care. This study aimed to explore men's perception on the provision of HIV testing services in venues where English Premier League football games are televised. Methods An exploratory qualitative study was conducted between February and May 2018. Six focus group discussions were conducted with 50 conveniently selected men aged 18 years and older using a pre-tested discussion guide. All focus group discussions were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed thematically. Results Overall, HIV testing at venues telecasting English Premier League football games was acceptable to men. There was a very strong preference for health workers providing testing and counseling services be external or unknown in the local community. Possible motivators for testing services provided in these settings include subsidizing or eliminating entrance fee to venues telecasting games, integrating testing and counseling with health promotion or screening for other diseases, use of local football games as mobilization tools and use of expert clients as role models. Conclusions This study suggests that HIV testing services at venues where EPL football games are televised is generally acceptable to men. In implementing such services, consideration should be given to preferences for external or unknown health workers and the motivating factors contributing to the use of these services. Given that HIV testing is currently not conducted in these settings, further research should be conducted to evaluate the feasibility of this approach as a means of enhancing HIV testing among Ugandan men.

AB Background Sleep disorders in an ageing society constitute a significant public health problem. It is estimated that approximately 50% of people aged 55 years and older have trouble sleeping, including initiating and maintaining sleep. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of sleep disorders in a group of educationally active elderly people living in Bialystok, Poland. Methods The study included a total of 182 people - residents of Bialystok - aged 60 or older; 146 women (80.22%) and 36 men (19.78%). The study used three standardized psychometric scales: The Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Results More than half of the respondents scored 6 or more points on the AIS, which is considered a value that indicates a high probability of insomnia symptom occurrence. A similar percentage of respondents obtained a point value on the ISI indicating the presence of insomnia. The vast majority of respondents scored below 11 points on the ESS, which means no symptoms of excessive sleepiness. There was a significant correlation between the results of the above scales in the examined group in total and also by sex. Conclusions Sleep disorders, particularly insomnia, constitute a significant social and health problem in the group of educationally active elderly people living in Bialystok. In light of the obtained study results, it is recommended to conduct and improve existing health education programs aimed at the elderly regarding sleep disorders to improve the quality of their sleep, and thus quality of life, and raise the awareness of the elderly about the importance of sleep in everyday life. There is a need for further research in the field of sleep disorders in the elderly to determine the prevalence of these disorders on a national scale.

AB Background Approximately one billion children experience violence every year. Violence against children is an urgent global public health concern and violation of children's rights. It is also a risk factor for serious negative health and social outcomes and is therefore addressed within the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Children with disabilities, who make up one in 20 children worldwide, are particularly vulnerable to violence although good quality data are lacking on causes and means of prevention of violence against children with disabilities. Key challenges exist in the measurement of disability and violence, which in part explains the dearth in evidence. Improving research on violence against children with disabilities This paper provides guidance on how to conduct good quality, ethical, and inclusive research on violence against children with disabilities, particularly in low-income settings. The lack of an international agreed 'gold standard' frustrates efforts to measure violence across settings and time. Careful consideration must be given to the design of survey tools. Qualitative and participatory research methods also offer important opportunities to explore children's subjective understanding and experiences of violence. Challenges also exist around the measurement of disability. Disability may be measured by asking directly about disability, through self-reported functioning, or through the presence of impairments or health conditions. These approaches have strengths and limitations and should build on what children are able to do and include appropriate adaptations for specific impairments where necessary. Ethical research also requires adherence to ethical guidelines and approvals, obtaining informed consent, appropriate child protection responses, and careful consideration of interviewer-related issues including their selection, training, and welfare. Key methodological gaps remain - how to include children with severe communication challenges in research; how to respond in instances of weak child protection systems; designing sampling procedures that adequately represent children with disabilities in large-scale violence surveys; and determining how best to ask about violence safely in large-scale surveys and monitoring data. This paper further advocates for the dissemination of research results in inclusive and accessible formats. Conclusion With careful planning, challenges in collecting data on disability and violence can be overcome to generate evidence in this neglected area.

AB Background
   The coexistence of overweight mother and stunted child at the same household is a type of Double Burden of Malnutrition at Household Level (DBMHL). This particular public health concern is now emerging at an alarming rate among most of the South Asian and its neighboring lower-and-middle income countries which are going through nutritional transition. This study has examined the prevalence rate and the risk factors of DBMHL along with the socio-economic inequality in DBMHL among Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, and Myanmar.
   Methods
   Latest Demographic and Health Survey datasets were used in this study. To identify the significant association of DBMHL with socio-demographic characteristics, a multivariate technique named as logistic regression model, and for measuring socio-economic inequalities in DBMHL prevalence, relative index of inequality (RII) and slope index of inequality (SII) were used.
   Results
   The prevalence rates of DBMHL were 4.10% (urban: 5.57%, rural: 3.51%), 1.54% (urban: 1.63%, rural: 1.42%), 3.93% (urban: 5.62%, rural: 3.20%), and 5.54% (urban: 6.16%, rural: 5.33%) respectively in Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, and Myanmar. The risk ratios (RR) obtained from RII for Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Myanmar were 1.25, 1.25, 1.14, and 1.09, respectively, and beta coefficient from SII were 0.01, 0.004, 0.005, and 0.006 unit respectively. In addition to not breastfeeding [Bangladesh (AOR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.11-2.15), Myanmar (AOR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.02-2.95)], respondent's older age (in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Myanmar), child's older age (in Pakistan and Myanmar), and middle and rich groups of wealth-index (in Bangladesh and Pakistan) were strong risk factors for DBMHL. On the other hand, female child [Nepal (AOR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.26-0.95), Pakistan (AOR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.41-0.84)], higher education [in Pakistan], respondent not participated in decision making [in Bangladesh and Nepal] and media access [Nepal (AOR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.20-0.98)] had negative association with DBMHL.
   Conclusion
   The DBMHL persists in all selected countries, with a higher prevalence in urban areas than in rural areas. In order to control the higher prevalence of DBMHL in urban areas, respective countries need urgent implementation of multisectoral actions through effective policies and empowering local communities.

AB Background
   Active living approaches seek to promote physical activity and reduce sedentary time across different domains, including through active travel. However, there is little information on how movement behaviours in different domains relate to each other. We used compositional data analysis to explore associations between active commuting and patterns of movement behaviour during discretionary time.
   Methods and findings
   We analysed cross-sectional and longitudinal data from the UK Biobank study. At baseline (2006-2010) and follow up (2009-2013) participants reported their mode of travel to work, dichotomised as active (walking, cycling or public transport) or inactive (car). Participants also reported activities performed during discretionary time, categorised as (i) screen time; (ii) walking for pleasure; and (iii) sport and do-it-yourself (DIY) activities, summed to produce a total. We applied compositional data analysis to test for associations between active commuting and the composition and total amount of discretionary time, using linear regression models adjusted for covariates. Adverse events were not investigated in this observational analysis. The survey response rate was 5.5%. In the cross-sectional analysis (n = 182,406; mean age = 52 years; 51% female), active commuters engaged in relatively less screen time than those who used inactive modes (coefficient -0.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.13 to -0.11), equating to approximately 60 minutes less screen time per week. Similarly, in the longitudinal analysis (n = 4,323; mean age = 51 years; 49% female) there were relative reductions in screen time in those who used active modes at both time points compared with those who used inactive modes at both time points (coefficient -0.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.24 to -0.06), equating to a difference between these commute groups of approximately 30 minutes per week at follow up. However, as exposures and outcomes were measured concurrently, reverse causation is possible.
   Conclusions
   Active commuting was associated with a more favourable pattern of movement behaviour during discretionary time. Active commuters accumulated 30-60 minutes less screen time per week than those using inactive modes. Though modest, this could have a cumulative effect on health over time.

AB Background Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in HIV endemic settings is a major threat to public health. MDR-TB is a substantial and underreported problem in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), with recognised cases projected to increase with advancement in diagnostic technology. There is paucity of review evidence on treatment outcomes and antiretroviral (ART) uptake among MDR-TB patients with HIV in SSA. To address this gap a review of treatment outcomes in HIV patients co-infected with MDR-TB in the SSA region was undertaken. Methods Three databases (Medline, Web of Science, CINHAL), Union on Lung Heath conference proceedings and grey literature were searched for publications between January 2004 and May 2018. Records were assessed for eligibility and data extracted. Random effect meta-analysis was conducted using STATA and Cochrane's review manager. Results A total of 271 publications were identified of which nine fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Data was collected from 3368 MDR-TB and HIV co-infected patients from four SSA countries; South Africa (6), Lesotho (1), Botswana (1) and Ethiopia (1). The most common outcome was cure (34.9% cured in the pooled analysis), this was followed by death (18.1% in pooled analysis). ART uptake was high, at 83% in the pooled analysis. Cure ranged from 28.6 to 54.7% among patients on ART and from 22.2 to 57.7% among those not on ART medication. MDR-TB and HIV co-infected patients were less likely to be successfully treated than HIV negative MDR-TB patients (Risk Ratio = 0.87, 95% CI 0.97, 0.96). Conclusion Treatment outcomes for MDR-TB and HIV co-infected patients do not vary widely from those reported globally. However, treatment success was lower among HIV positive MDR-TB patients compared to HIV negative MDR-TB patients. Prompt antiretroviral initiation and interventions to improve treatment adherence are necessary.

AB Background Diabetes has become one of public health problem up until now. As the disease progressed, it might lead to increasing complication as well as death related to them. Diabetes as chronic disease in older people can lead to more vulnerable conditions if they fail to carry out a proper diabetes self-management. Diabetes literacy is an internal factor affecting how the older people go about their diabetes management routines. This study aimed to describe diabetes literacy of the older people and identify the relation of diabetes literacy to diabetes self-management of the older people with T2DM in selected areas of Depok City, West Java, Indonesia. Method A cross-sectional observational study was utilized and used 106 samples of older people individuals with T2DM, all of whom were chosen via cluster sampling. This research took place in five selected areas under the supervision of three public health center in Depok City. The data were analyzed using a bivariate t-independent test, the Pearson product-moment correlation, and logistic regression for multivariate analysis to determine the relationship of independent and dependent variable. Result This research shows a significant correlation between diabetes literacy and diabetes self-management (p = 0,011). Conclusion Diabetes self management is associated with diabetes literacy in older people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetes literacy should be considered when assessing and addressing diabetes-specific health education needs.

AB Background Antenatal clinical guidelines recommend that during initial and subsequent antenatal visits all pregnant women: have their alcohol consumption assessed; be advised that it is safest not to consume alcohol during pregnancy and of the potential risks of consumption; and be offered referrals for further support if required. However, the extent to which pregnant women attending public antenatal services receive guideline recommended care at these visits, and the characteristics associated with its receipt, is unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine: 1) pregnant women's reported receipt of guideline recommended care addressing alcohol consumption during pregnancy; 2) characteristics associated with the receipt of care; and 3) pregnant women's acceptability of care. Methods From July 2017 - February 2018 a survey (telephone or online) was undertaken with 1363 pregnant women who had recently visited a public antenatal service in one health district in Australia. Receipt and acceptability of recommended care were assessed via descriptive statistics and associations via logistic regression analyses. Results At the initial antenatal visit, less than two thirds (64.3%) of pregnant women reported that they received an assessment of their alcohol consumption and just over one third (34.9%) received advice and referral appropriate to their self-reported level of alcohol consumption since pregnancy recognition. Less than 10% of women received such care at subsequent antenatal visits. Characteristics that significantly increased the odds of receiving all guideline elements at the initial antenatal visit included: less than university attainment (OR = 1.93; 95% CI:1.12, 3.34), not residing in an advantaged area (OR = 2.11; 95% CI:1.17, 3.79), first pregnancy (OR = 1.91; 95% CI:1.22, 2.99) and regional/rural service location (OR = 2.38; 95% CI:1.26, 4.48); and at subsequent visits: younger age (OR = 0.91; 95% CI:0.84, 0.99) and Aboriginal origin (OR = 3.17; 95% CI:1.22, 8.24). Each of the recommended care elements were highly acceptable to pregnant women (88.3-99.4%). Conclusions Although care for alcohol consumption is both recommended by clinical guidelines and highly acceptable to pregnant women, its receipt in public antenatal services is suboptimal. There is a need and an opportunity for interventions to support antenatal care providers to routinely and consistently provide such care to all pregnant women.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Background Suicide is a serious public health concern. Depression is the main gateway to suicidal behavior. The already established relationship between depression and suicidal risk should now focus on the investigation of more specific factors: recent studies have suggested an association between vulnerability to suicidal behavior and neurocognitive alterations, a nuclear symptom of depression. This project aims to identify alterations in the Executive Functions (EF) of patients suffering a first depressive episode that might constitute a risk factor for suicidal ideation, suicidal attempts and suicide, to allow for more adequate suicide prevention. Methods Prospective longitudinal design involving two groups (first depressive episodes with and without alterations in their EF) and four repeated measures (0, 6, 12 and 24 months). The estimated minimum sample size is 216 subjects. The variables and measurement instruments will include socio-demographic variables, clinical variables (age of illness onset, family and personal antecedents, psychopathological and medical comorbidity, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and completed suicides, severity of depression, including melancholic or atypical, remission of the depressive episode), and neuropsychological variables (EF and decision-making processes evaluated through the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB)). Discussion First and foremost, the identification of clinical and neuropsychological risk factors associated with suicidal behavior will open the possibility to prevent such behavior in patients with a first depressive episode in the context of clinical practice. Secondly, interventions aimed at cognitive impairment (in particular: EF) derived from the study may be incorporated into strategies for the prevention of suicidal behavior. Finally, impaired neurocognitive function (even in early stages) could become an identifiable endophenotype or "marker" in clinical and neurobiological studies about suicidal behavior in depressive patients.

AB Background Social participation is a modifiable health determinant influenced by physical and social aspects of the environment. Little is known about aging women's and men's community activities and barriers according to region and population size. This study compared social participation, desire to participate more, and perceived barriers of aging women and men by Canadian region and population size. Methods A secondary analysis of the 2008-2009 cross-sectional Canadian Community Health Survey - Healthy Aging was done with 16,274 respondents aged 65+. Respondents were grouped into five regions [Atlantic, Quebec, Ontario, Prairies and British Columbia] and five population size groups [rural (< 1000 inhabitants); small urban (1000-29,999); medium urban (30,000-99,999); large urban (100,000-499,999); and metropolitan (>= 500,000) areas]. Social participation was estimated by monthly frequencies of engagement in community activities. If they desired to participate more, respondents were asked to identify barriers to their participation from a list of 13 reasons. Results There were no differences in total social participation between regions but Prairies and Quebec respondents had the highest and lowest frequency, respectively, of activities with family and friends (5.4 and 4.3 activities/month; p = 0.01). Medium urban centers had the highest participation and metropolises, the lowest (17.4 vs 14.3 activities/month; p < 0.01). About one fourth of all respondents wanted to participate more, regardless of region or population size. Overall, women wanted to participate more than men (26.6 vs 20.7%; p < 0.001), especially in Ontario (28.3 vs 21.1%; p < 0.001) and British Columbia (30.1 vs 22.9%; p < 0.001). Men in Quebec were less likely than men in other regions to report "personal responsibilities" as a barrier to participation (p < 0.001). Men were more likely than women to report being "too busy", especially in rural areas (27.1 vs 6.5%; p < 0.001). Rural women were more likely than rural men to be constrained by transportation problems (15.1 vs 1.2%, p < 0.001). Unavailability of activities was more of a constraint in rural areas than metropolises (13.6 vs 6.0%, p < 0.001). Conclusions Overall, there were no practical differences between women's and men's social participation. However, unavailability of activities and transportation problems suggest that local initiatives and further research on environmental characteristics are required to foster aging Canadians' participation.

AB Background The Ultraviolet (UV) Index provides a reliable means of monitoring the strength of UV radiation at the Earth's surface, which can be used to indicate the potential for skin damage. This qualitative study aims to examine public understanding of the UV Index among Australians who routinely use UV forecast information as well as those who do not. Methods Recent use of the SunSmart app (a popular mobile and tablet app that provides UV forecast information) served as a proxy for use of UV forecast information. Six focus groups were conducted with 'new users', who trialled the SunSmart app for the first time in the two weeks preceding the group discussion. In addition, 15 in-depth interviews were conducted with 'existing users', who routinely used the SunSmart app. Thematic discourse analysis was undertaken to compare views and experiences. Results Misperceptions about UV radiation were common. Participants learnt new information about UV radiation, the UV Index, and the times of the day that sun protection is recommended. Among adults who were using UV forecast information for the first time, this learning rarely translated to new behaviours; for these participants, the UV Index forecast information and recommendations were inconsistent with their own observation of the weather and subsequent judgement about their propensity to burn. Thus new users considered the UV forecast information to be overly cautious. In contrast, existing users recognised their inability to judge the UV Index level; for these participants, UV forecast information provided by the SunSmart app was incorporated into their daily routines and used to inform their sun protection behaviours.

AB Access to HIV/AIDS-related health services among transgender women living with HIV is still a major public health issue in many developing countries, and Indonesia is not an exception. However, reportedly compared to other settings in the country, transgender women in Yogyakarta have a good access to the HIV-related health services. This study aimed to explore perceptions among transgender women living with HIV, locally known as waria, of factors supportive of their access to the services in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. A qualitative inquiry using in-depth interview method was conducted from December 2017 to February 2018 to collect the data from a selection of waria living with HIV (n = 29) recruited using both purposive and snowball sampling techniques. Data analysis employed a thematic approach which was guided by the framework analysis for qualitative data. The findings indicated several health service system-related determinants supportive of waria's access to HIV/AIDS-related health services. These included the availability of the services, the simplicity and convenience of accessibility to the services and the comfort felt by the participants while accessing the services. Health professionals' positive attitudes during healthcare provision, social relationships between waria and health professionals, proximity to healthcare facilities, free access to the services, and information sessions on HIV infection and prevention were also reported to enable participants' access to the services. These findings call to efforts and strengthening of HIV health service system to support and provide equal access to HIV/AIDS-related services including to all Indonesians living with HIV, but more so for transgender women and other high-risk groups such as sex workers and their clients and men who have sex with men.

AB Palliative care aims to improve quality of life for people with serious illness and their families. One potential barrier to palliative care uptake is inaccurate knowledge and/or negative beliefs among the general population, which may inhibit early interest in, communication about, and integration of palliative care following subsequent illness diagnosis. We explored knowledge and beliefs about palliative care among the general public using nationally-representative data collected in 2018 as part of the cross-sectional Health Information National Trends Survey. Only individuals who had heard of palliative care (n = 1,162, M-age = 51.8, 64% female) were queried on knowledge and beliefs. We examined whether self-assessed level of awareness of palliative care (i.e., knowing a little vs. enough to explain it) was associated with the relative likelihood of having accurate/positive beliefs, inaccurate/negative beliefs, or responding "don't know" to questions about palliative care. Respondents who indicated knowing a lot about palliative care had more accurate versus inaccurate knowledge than those who knew a little on only two of six items and more positive attitudes on only one of three items. In particular, respondents with greater awareness were equally likely to report that palliative care is the same as hospice and requires stopping other treatments, and equally likely to believe that palliative care means giving up and to associate palliative care with death. Those with higher awareness were less likely than those with lower awareness to respond "don't know," but greater awareness was not necessarily associated with having accurate or positive beliefs about palliative care as opposed to inaccurate or negative beliefs. Thus, even members of the general public who perceived themselves to know a lot about palliative care were often no less likely to report inaccurate knowledge or negative beliefs (versus accurate and positive, respectively). Findings suggest a need to improve awareness and attitudes about palliative care.

AB The nature of services for psychiatric disorders in public health systems has been understudied, particularly with regard to frequency, duration, and costs. The current study examines patterns of service reception and costs among Medicaid-covered youth newly diagnosed with anxiety, depression, or behavioral disturbance in a large data set of provider billing claims submitted between 2015-2016. Eligibility criteria included: 1) identification of an initial diagnosis of a single anxiety, unipolar mood, or specific behavioral disorder; 2) continuous Medicaid eligibility over the duration of the time period studied; and 3) under 18 years of age on the date of initial psychiatric diagnosis. The final cohort included 7,627 cases with a mean age of 10.65 (+/- 4.36), of which 58.04% were male, 57.09% were Black, 38.97% were White, and 3.95% were of other ethnicities. Data indicated that 65.94% of the cohort received at least some follow-up services within a median 18 days of diagnosis. Of those, 54.27% received a combination of medical and psychosocial services, 32.01% received medical services only, and 13.72% received psychosocial services only. Overall median costs for direct treatment were $576.69, with wide discrepancies between the lowest (anxiety = $308.41) and highest (behavioral disturbance = $653.59) diagnostic categories. Across all categories the frequency and duration of psychosocial services were much lower than would be expected in comparison to data from a well-known effectiveness trial. Overall, follow-up to psychiatric diagnosis could be characterized as highly variable, underutilized, and emphasizing biomedical treatment. Understanding more about these patterns may facilitate systematic improvements and greater cost efficiency in the future.

TI Emergency department visits and hospitalizations among hemodialysis
   patients by day of the week and dialysis schedule in the United States
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PRACTICE PATTERNS; INTRADIALYTIC HYPOTENSION; MORTALITY; OUTCOMES;
   ULTRAFILTRATION; TIME
AB Background and objective
   Previous reports indicated that patients on thrice-weekly hemodialysis (HD) had higher mortality rates after the 3-day interdialytic interval. However, day-of-the-week patterns of emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations remain under-investigated.
   Methods
   We conducted a retrospective cohort study of HD patients on thrice-weekly dialysis, using 2013 data from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS). We estimated crude incidence rates of ED visits and hospitalizations by day of the week and dialysis schedule (Monday, Wednesday, Friday or Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday). Using Poisson regression, we estimated case-mix adjusted rate ratios of all-cause ED visits and hospitalizations, and adjusted rates of cause-specific ED visits and hospitalizations.
   Results
   We identified 241,093 eligible HD patients in 2013, who had 514,773 ED visits and 301,674 hospitalizations that year. Three distinct but related patterns of outcome events were observed. Crude and adjusted incidence rates of all-cause, cardiovascular, and infection-related ED visits and hospitalizations, but not vascular-access-related events, were higher on all three HD treatment days ("dialysis-day effect"). Rates for ED visits and hospitalizations were lower on weekends than weekdays, rising appreciably from Sunday to Monday for both dialysis schedules ("post-weekend effect"); and rates were highest after the long 3-day interval between dialysis sessions for both dialysis schedules ("interdialytic-gap effect"). In contrast, rates of hospitalizations not preceded by an ED visit were nearly the same Monday through Friday and lower on weekends for both dialysis schedules.
   Conclusions
   Higher rates of ED visits and hospitalizations on the days of HD sessions and early in the week are a public-health concern that should stimulate research to explain these patterns and reduce the excessive morbidity and associated costs among patients on thrice-weekly HD, while improving quality of care and patient experience with dialysis.

AB Background Harmful alcohol consumption in Germany is a serious public health problem: About 7.7 million adults in Germany can be classified as risky alcohol consumers, about 74,000 deaths per year are related to alcohol consumption, and about 1.8 million adults in Germany (18-64 years) are classified as alcohol dependent. A treatment rate of 9% of all alcohol dependent patients in Germany implies a lack of supply and misuse of medical care. The aim of the study was to examine whether family practitioners (FPs) and psychiatrists have sufficient skills to diagnose and treat patients with alcohol problems. Methods A total of 6324 FPs and psychiatrists in the states of Saxony and Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany were invited to participate in this survey. Nine hundred seventy-four participants (90.3%/FPs) could be included in the statistical analysis (response rate: 14.3%/FPs, 21.6%/psychiatrists). Data was analysed descriptively and logistical regressions were used to identify predictors for physicians' ability to feel adequately trained to diagnose and treat patients with alcohol problems. Results In comparison to psychiatrists, less FPs reported feeling sufficiently trained to counsel patients with alcohol problems (81.5% vs. 44.8%). Regression analysis revealed that FPs who felt not adequately trained had less experience with patients with alcohol dependence (OR 7.4), had attended fewer hours on alcohol addiction in continuing medical education (OR 4.8), and were more likely to be female (OR 1.9). A minimum of 10 h of training was associated with improved self-assessed competence. Conclusion Harmful drinking is a serious public health problem, and patients with alcohol dependence represent a large and demanding patient group in primary health care setting. Our study shows that the lack of training is a severe barrier in the work with this patient group in the primary care setting.

AB Background Vitamin D deficiency has been highlighted as a serious public health problem in the United Kingdom. One in four toddlers are not achieving the recommended intake for their healthy development. This study uses quantitative and qualitative methods to explore parents' perceptions, awareness and behaviours around vitamin D intake, and the acceptability of and factors affecting purchasing of food and drink fortified with Vitamin D in children aged 0-2 years old. Methods One hundred and ninety-four parents completed an online questionnaire, advertised to parents with one child aged up to 2 years on popular social media websites. The majority of participants were mothers, White-British ethnic background, aged 25-44 years. Participants provided an email address if they wanted to be contacted about the focus groups. Recruitment posters advertising the focus groups were placed in community centres. Eighteen participated in 5 focus groups (13 parents), and 5 individual interviews. A thematic analysis methodology was applied. Results Fifty-seven percent (n = 110) of parents reported receiving information about vitamin D during pregnancy and 52% (n = 100) after the birth of their child. Parents reported a low level of satisfaction with vitamin D information: many thought it was limited and recommendations on supplements were unclear. Parents wanted more information about vitamin D requirements for their child (80%, n = 153 out of 192 respondents, 2 non-response), about vitamin D and breastfeeding (56%, n = 108) and vitamin D and pregnancy (49%, n = 94). The recommendations were for simpler, easier to read, with specific and clearer guidelines; delivered regularly during routine appointments, at timely stages throughout pregnancy and after the birth. 23% (n = 45, out of 194 respondents) of parents did not know why vitamin D is important for health. Only 26% (n = 49, out of 192 respondents) of parents reported giving their youngest child a vitamin D supplement on most days of the week. The majority of parents (interview/focus group) wanted more information about foods/drinks fortified with vitamin D. Conclusion Parents were generally not aware of the importance of vitamin D, dietary requirements including supplementation and the availability of vitamin D fortified foods. Major improvements are required for the effective promotion of vitamin D information to parents.

AB Background Lyme disease is a tick-borne disease of increasing global importance. There is scant information on Lyme disease patient demographics in England and Wales, and how they interact with the National Health Service (NHS). Our aims were to explore the demographic characteristics of Lyme disease patients within the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and Patient Episode Database for Wales (PEDW), and to describe patient pathways. Methods Data from 1st January 1998 to 31st December 2015 was retrieved from the two administrative hospital datasets (HES and PEDW), based on patients coded with Lyme disease. Information was collected on demographic characteristics, home address and case management. Incidence rates were calculated, and demographics compared to the national population. Results Within HES and PEDW, 2361 patients were coded with Lyme disease. There was a significant increase (p < 0.01) in incidence from 0.08 cases/100,000 in 1998, to 0.53 cases/100,000 in 2015. There was a bimodal age distribution, patients were predominantly female, white and from areas of low deprivation. New cases peaked annually in August, with higher incidence rates in southern central and western England. Within hospital admission data (n = 2066), most cases were either referred from primary care (28.8%, n = 596) or admitted via accident and emergency (A&E) (29.5%, n = 610). This population entering secondary care through A&E suggest a poor understanding of the recommended care pathways for symptoms related to Lyme disease by the general population. Conclusions These data can be used to inform future investigations into Lyme disease burden, and patient management within the NHS. They provide demographic information for clinicians to target public health messaging or interventions.

AB The emerging and increasing prevalence of bacterial antibiotic resistance is a significant public health challenge. To begin to tackle this problem, it will be critical to not only understand the origins of this resistance but also document environmental reservoirs of antibiotic resistance. In this study we investigated the possibility that both colony and field caught mosquitoes could harbor antibiotic resistant bacteria. Specifically, we characterized the antibiotic resistant bacterial populations from colony-reared Aedes aegypti larvae and adults and two field caught mosquito species Coquillettidia perturbans and Ochlerotatus canadensis. The cultured bacterial populations were dominated by isolates belonging to the class Gammaproteobacteria. Among the antibiotic resistant populations, we found bacteria resistant to carbenicillin, kanamycin, and tetracycline, including bacteria resistant to a cocktail of all three antibiotics in combination. The antibiotic resistant bacteria were numerically rare, at most 5% of total cell counts. Isolates were characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and clustering into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs; 99% sequence identity). 27 antibiotic resistant OTUs were identified, although members of an OTU did not always share the same resistance profile. This suggests the clustering was either not sensitive enough to distinguish different bacteria taxa or different antibiotic resistant sub-populations exist within an OTU. Finally, the antibiotic selection opened up a niche to culture mosquito-associated fungi, and 10 fungal OTUs (28S rRNA gene sequencing) were identified. Two fungal OTUs both classified to the class Microbotryomycetes were commonly identified in the field-caught mosquitoes. Thus, in this study we demonstrate that antibiotic resistant bacteria and certain fungi are common and conserved mosquito microbiome members. These observations highlight the potential of invertebrates to serve as vehicles for the spread of antibiotic resistance throughout the environment.

TI ETM-DB: integrated Ethiopian traditional herbal medicine and
   phytochemicals database
SO BMC COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Ethiopia; Integrated database; Traditional medicine; Phytochemicals
ID NATURAL-PRODUCTS; PLANTS; UMLS
AB Background Recently, there has been an increasing tendency to go back to nature in search of new medicines. To facilitate this, a great deal of effort has been made to compile information on natural products worldwide, and as a result, many ethnic-based traditional medicine databases have been developed. In Ethiopia, there are more than 80 ethnic groups, each having their indigenous knowledge on the use of traditional medicine. About 80% of the population uses traditional medicine for primary health care. Despite this, there is no structured online database for Ethiopian traditional medicine, which limits natural products based drug discovery researches using natural products from this country. Description To develop ETM-DB, online research articles, theses, books, and public databases containing Ethiopian herbal medicine and phytochemicals information were searched. These resources were thoroughly inspected and the necessary data were extracted. Then, we developed a comprehensive online relational database which contains information on 1054 Ethiopian medicinal herbs with 1465 traditional therapeutic uses, 573 multi-herb prescriptions, 4285 compounds, 11,621 human target gene/proteins, covering 5779 herb-phenotype, 1879 prescription-herb, 16,426 herb-compound, 105,202 compound-phenotype, 162,632 compound-gene/protein, and 16,584 phenotype-gene/protein relationships. Using various cheminformatics tools, we obtained predicted physicochemical and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties of ETM-DB compounds. We also evaluated drug-likeness properties of these compounds using FAF-Drugs4 webserver. From the 4285 compounds, 4080 of them passed the FAF-Drugs4 input data curation stage, of which 876 were found to have acceptable drug-likeness properties. Conclusion ETM-DB is the largest, freely accessible, web-based integrated resource on Ethiopian traditional medicine. It provides traditional herbal medicine entities and their relationships in well-structured forms including reference to the sources. The ETM-DB website interface allows users to search the entities using various options provided by the search menu. We hope that our database will expedite drug discovery and development researches from Ethiopian natural products as it contains information on the chemical composition and related human target gene/proteins. The current version of ETM-DB is openly accessible at http://biosoft.kaist.ac.kr/etm..

AB Background Internationally, there is a drive to involve patients and the public in health research, due to recognition that patient and public involvement (PPI) may increase the impact and relevance of health research. This scoping review describes the extent and nature of PPI in dementia research in the European Union (EU) and summarises: (i) how PPI is carried out; and (ii) the impact of PPI on people living with dementia and the public, researchers, and the research process. Methods Relevant studies were identified by searches in electronic reference databases and then filtered by two reviewers independently. Eligibility criteria for included studies were: (i) people living with dementia and/or care partners; (ii) PPI activity in dementia research conducted in the European Union (EU); and (iii) published between 2000 and 2018. An adapted version of the Guidance for Reporting Involvement of Patients and the Public (GRIPP2 SF) was used to collate the data. There was no language restriction other than the abstract needed to be available in English. Results We found 19 studies from the UK and one from the Netherlands meeting inclusion criteria. No studies from other EU countries met inclusion criteria. Studies reported various methods of PPI including workshops, drop-in sessions, meetings, consensus conference, reader consultation and participatory approach. The reported aims of PPI included identifying and prioritising research questions (n = 4), research design (n = 5), undertaking and managing research (n = 8), and data analysis and interpretation (n = 3). All PPI related to design and implementation of non-pharmacological studies. One study described two pharmacological studies as case studies incorporating PPI. Seventeen studies reported anecdotal impacts of PPI. Conclusions Further development of PPI in dementia research in the EU and in pharmacological dementia research is required. Given the wide range of objectives of PPI in dementia research, PPI methods should be flexible and appropriate for the research context. Researchers should also formally evaluate and report the impacts of PPI for researchers, patients and the general public using good quality research designs to foster development of the field and enable the benefits and challenges of PPI to be better understood.

AB Background Factors associated with increases in dental caries and changes in the family socioeconomic profile were investigated in a paediatric primary health care (PHC) cohort in Northeast Brazil during the implementation of social and income transfer programmes. Method A prospective analytical study compared data from two surveys on caries in primary dentition conducted in 2006 (age: 18-36 months, n = 1045) and 2010 (age: 5-7 years). Data from the sample recruited and re-examined in 2010 (n = 469) were analysed. Prevalences (P) and the mean primary decayed, missing and filled teeth (dmft) index, cumulative incidence and mean increase were calculated. Differences (p <= 0.05 and 95% CI) in dmft >= 1 were identified via McNemar's test. Differences in the mean dmft were evaluated according to socioeconomic variables (Kruskal-Wallis test and p <= 0.05). Multivariate analysis with a negative binomial model was used for the risk factors associated with increasing dmft. In the univariate analyses, nonparametric methods (Kruskal-Wallis test) were used to compare subsamples. Variables with p <= 0.20 were included in the multivariate model and retained when p <= 0.05. Results The prevalence and mean dmft (18-36 months and 5-7 years: p = 28.6 and 68.9%, mean = 1.01 and 3.46, respectively) and variation in mean dmft changed significantly (p < 0.005) with the education level and occupation of the mother; the prevalence and mean dmft were lower for higher maternal education level and maternal participation in the labour market. The cumulative incidence and mean increase in dmft were 8.71% and 2.45, respectively. Common risk predictors for increases in caries were consumption of sweets (RR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.09-2.14) and attendance at public schools (RR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.81-1.89). Use of private clinical services was a protective factor (RR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.54-0.87). Conclusion Increases in caries were observed despite positive changes in the distribution of socioeconomic indicators for the analysed children's families. The risk factors identified for the increase in caries suggest ongoing problems regarding the effectiveness of intersectoral and health measures for controlling caries in populations exposed to PHC programmes.

AB Background There is a paucity of population-based surveys on oral health conditions in Ecuador. Thus, the aim of this study was to conduct an epidemiological survey with a representative sample of children aged 12 years from public schools of Quito, Ecuador. The aim of this initial report was to describe the methodology used in the survey, as well to present results regarding calibration procedures and prevalence of oral-health related outcomes. Methods We invited 33 public schools' coordinators from the urban area of Quito, and 1100 children (12 years old) to take part in this study. Six trained and calibrated examiners conducted clinical examinations using oral mirrors and ball-ended probes to assess: dental caries, traumatic dental injuries, malocclusion, gingival bleeding, presence of calculus and fluorosis. Children also responded a questionnaire on Oral Health-Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL). Individual sociodemographic data was collected through a questionnaire sent to parents. Moreover, some contextual data on school environment (infrastructure conditions, promotion of health practices and negative episodes) were also evaluated. Prevalence values, crude and weighted by sampling weights, and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated. Results Nine hundred and ninety-eight children from 31 schools were examined from March to May 2017. The adjusted prevalence values (95%CI) for the six outcomes evaluated were: dental caries = 60.3% (55.3 to 65.0%); traumatic dental injuries = 20.7% (17.2 to 24.8%); dental fluorosis = 63.7% (58.5 to 68.5%); gingival bleeding = 92.0% (87.1 to 95.2%); presence of calculus = 69.9 (60.5 to 77.9%); and malocclusion = 25.8% (21.8 to 30.3%). Adjusted mean of number of decayed, missed or filled permanent teeth (DMF-T) was 1.61 (1.37 to 1.84). Results on OHRQoL and other contextual variables will be reported in other articles. Conclusion The prevalence of the majority of oral health problems in 12-year-old children from public schools in Quito-Ecuador was compatible with those observed in other similar cities. However, periodontal health and fluorosis seem to be highly prevalent in children from Quito.

AB Background This study examines how prevalence and behaviors of smoking differ by socioeconomic status among rural southwest Chinese adults. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted including 7743 adults aged >= 35 years in rural regions of Yunnan Province, China from 2016 to 2018. Information on individual socioeconomic status (SES), ethnicity, and self-reported smoking behaviors was collected utilizing a standardized questionnaire. The individual socioeconomic position (SEP) index was constructed using principal component analysis. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between individual SES variables and the prevalence and behaviors of smoking. Results In the study population, the overall prevalence rate of current smokers was 33.5%. Males had a markedly higher prevalence of current smokers than females (62.6% vs. 4.8%, P < 0.01). Of these smokers, 74.5% began smoking during adolescence, 88.8% had never attempted to quit smoking, and 81.1% reported smoking in public places. Ethnic minority participants and those with low levels of education and/or low SEP were more likely to use tobacco as well as more likely to start smoking, and regularly smoke, during adolescence (P < 0.01). Participants with poor access to medical services had a higher prevalence of current smoking than their counterparts (P < 0.01). Among current smokers, Han ethnicity, good access to medical services, and high SEP were positively associated with the probability of having attempted to quit smoking at least once, while a high level of education and high SEP were negatively associated with the probability of smoking in public places. Conclusions Disparities in prevalence and behaviors of smoking exist across a diversity of indicators of individual SES in rural southwest China. Future tobacco cessation interventions should focus on men, ethnic minorities, and those with low education levels, poor access to medical services, and low SEP.

AB Background Electronic health record (EHR) data, collected primarily for individual patient care and billing purposes, compiled in health information exchanges (HIEs) may have a secondary use for population health surveillance of noncommunicable diseases. However, data compilation across fragmented data sources into HIEs presents potential barriers and quality of data is unknown. Methods We compared 2015 patient data from a mid-size health system (Database A) to data from System A patients in the Utah HIE (Database B). We calculated concordance of structured data (sex and age) and unstructured data (blood pressure reading and A1C). We estimated adjusted hypertension and diabetes prevalence in each database and compared these across age groups. Results Matching resulted in 72,356 unique patients. Concordance between Database A and Database B exceeded 99% for sex and age, but was 89% for A1C results and 54% for blood pressure readings. Sensitivity, using Database A as the standard, was 57% for hypertension and 55% for diabetes. Age and sex adjusted prevalence of diabetes (8.4% vs 5.8%, Database A and B, respectively) and hypertension (14.5% vs 11.6%, respectively) differed, but this difference was consistent with parallel slopes in prevalence over age groups in both databases. Conclusions We identified several gaps in the use of HIE data for surveillance of diabetes and hypertension. High concordance of structured data demonstrate some promise in HIEs capacity to capture patient data. Improving HIE data quality through increased use of structured variables may help make HIE data useful for population health surveillance in places with fragmented EHR systems.

ID INDOOR RADON; EXPOSURE; AWARENESS; EVALUATE; GAS
AB Background Radon is a high impact environmental pollutant and is the second leading cause of lung cancer in Canada. Building design, extended winter, and geographical location expose residents of Ottawa-Gatineau (the national capital region in Canada) to an increased risk. It is surprising that residents have an inadequate awareness of the risk - despite its gravity - and have taken minimum preventive actions. This study explores perceptions of radon health risk and examines the factors that enable and hinder the adoption of preventive measures among Ottawa-Gatineau residents. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with 35 residents with varying educational and income levels to inquire about their knowledge and perception of radon, and to explore their views of enablers and obstacles to taking action to reduce radon risks. Thematic, inductive data analysis was undertaken. Results The results indicate that: 1) Residents obtained information on radon from various sources that include the media, their education or occupation, their social network, and home renovation events. Limited references were made to the National Radon Program responsible for testing for radon and informing residents. 2) Awareness of radon risk varied, and the knowledge retained by some residents is insufficient to adequately protect their health. 3) Enablers for taking protective action included: having an understanding of the risk along with health consciousness; caring for family and children; knowing others who had contracted lung cancer and having financial resources. Obstacles consisted of: lack of awareness; cost; lack of home ownership; and potential difficulty in selling the house. 4) Residents attributed primary responsibility to public agencies for disseminating information, and incentivizing or mandating action through more stringent regulation. Conclusion Risk perceptions are subjective, and are influenced by micro and macro level factors. Inducing protective action to reduce risk requires comprehensive interventions taking into account the dual cognitive and emotional aspects of risk perception. Future research may explore the dual aspects of risk perception and examine the contents of the risk communication message. Policy should address the responsibility of both governments and residents in tackling the issue.

DE Improving access to psychological therapies; Cognitive Behavioural

ID DISORDERS
AB This commentary examines publicly available information on 2017-2018 outcomes in the UK government's Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme, a National Health Service (NHS) primary care mental health programme in England. In that year there were 1.4 million referrals into IAPT and over 500,000 people completed a course of treatment. The IAPT database collects routine session-by-session outcome monitoring data for this population, including outcomes for depression and anxiety in a stepped care model which includes a range of psychological therapies, among them Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Person-centred Experiential Therapy, known in the IAPT programme as Counselling for Depression (CfD). In 2017-18, 32% of all referrals were for anxiety and stress disorders, 26% for depression, and 35% were unspecified. The definition of treatment completion is receipt of 2 sessions or more and on this basis 60% of all referrals in 2017-18 did not complete treatment, predominantly because they failed to attend the initial appointment, or ended after only one session. Four years of data on outcomes for CBT and CfD suggests these therapies are broadly comparable in terms of both recovery rate and average number of sessions, though the number of referrals to each therapy varied widely. Data on treatment choice and satisfaction was favourable but there were issues with low return rates and invalid data. Information on outcomes for ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and religion, as well as a measure of local economic deprivation, indicate lower outcomes for a number of patient groups. Data on employment status outcomes suggest little overall change, including for the category of those on benefits payments. The data published alongside the annual IAPT reports mean there is an increasing amount of information in the public domain about IAPT performance, but it is time consuming to extract and evaluate. This report highlights a number of points of concern which suggest the need for improvement on multiple axes. We suggest that improved researcher access to the huge IAPT dataset can allow for more detailed evaluations of IAPT that can inform policy/decision-making to improve outcomes for clients.

AB In recent years, outbreaks caused by multi-host pathogens (MHP) have posed a serious challenge to public and animal health authorities. The frequent implication of wildlife in such disease systems and a lack of guidelines for mitigating these diseases within wild animal populations partially explain why the outbreaks are particularly challenging. To face these challenges, the French Ministry of Agriculture launched a multi-disciplinary group of experts that set out to discuss the main wildlife specific concepts in the management of MHP disease outbreaks and how to integrate wildlife in the disease management process. This position paper structures the primary specific concepts of wildlife disease management, as identified by the working group. It is designed to lay out these concepts for a wide audience of public and/or animal health officers who are not necessarily familiar with wildlife diseases. The group's discussions generated a possible roadmap for the management of MHP diseases. This roadmap is presented as a cycle for which the main successive step are: step 1-descriptive studies and monitoring; step 2-risk assessment; step 3-management goals; step 4-management actions and step 5-assessment of the management plan. In order to help choose the most adapted management actions for all involved epidemiological units, we integrated a decision-making framework (presented as a spreadsheet). This tool and the corresponding guidelines for disease management are designed to be used by public and health authorities when facing MHP disease outbreaks. These proposals are meant as an initial step towards a harmonized transboundary outbreak response framework that integrates current scientific understanding adapted to practical intervention.

TI Dietary pattern and its association with iodine deficiency among school
   children in southwest Ethiopia; A cross-sectional study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PREGNANCY; GROWTH; GOITER
AB Background
   Despite the universal iodization of salt in Ethiopia, iodine deficiency disorder remains a major public health problem and continued to affect a large segment of the population. It is thus essential to assess factors contributing to the unacceptably high endemic goiter rate in the country and avail evidence for further additional interventions. In line with this, we examined the association of dietary pattern and iodine deficiency among school-age children in Ethiopia.
   Method
   We conducted a school-based cross-sectional study among 767 children aged 6 to 12 in southwest Ethiopia. We collected socio-demographic and other important health related information using a pre-tested structured questionnaire through the interview. Dietary pattern of children was measured using modified Hellen Keller's food frequency questionnaire. We measured iodine deficiency using urinary iodine concentration level and total goiter rate, according to the World Health Organization threshold criteria. We used a multivariate linear regression model to identify dietary and sociodemographic factors that affect urinary iodine level among children.
   Result
   Out of the 767 children included in the study, 12% and 4% of children have grade 1 and grade 2 goiter respectively, making the total goiter rate 16%. While the prevalence of iodine deficiency based on urinary iodine concentration is 58.8% of which 13.7% had severe, 18.6% had moderate and 26.5% had mild form. The proportion of children who consumed godere/taro root/, banana, corn, Abyssinian cabbage, and potato, respectively at daily basis 57.8%, 53.1%, 37.9%, and 31.2%, respectively. Age (beta = -0.7, 95%CI = -1.1, -0.4), sex (beta = -22.3, 95%CI = -33.8, -10.8), consumption of taro root (beta = -27.4, 95%CI = -22.9, -31.8), cabbage (beta = -11.7, 95%CI = -5.7, -17.6), Abyssinian cabbage (beta = 12.4, 95%CI = 6.7, 18.2), and banana (beta = 5.6, 95%CI = 0.01, 11.2) significantly associated with urinary iodine level.
   Conclusion
   Iodine deficiency remains an important public health problem in southwest Ethiopia. Over-consumption of goitrogenic foods and under-consumption of iodine-rich foods were prevalent and associated with lower urinary iodine level. Therefore, dietary counseling apart from universal salt iodization is recommended.

DT Article
ID CARE
AB Background
   It is cost-effective to perform an HIV test in people with specific indicator conditions (IC) with an undiagnosed HIV prevalence of at least 0.1%. Our aim was to determine the HIV prevalence for 14 different conditions across 20 European countries.
   Methods
   Individuals aged 18-65 years presenting for care with one of 14 ICs between January 2012 and June 2014 were included and routinely offered an HIV test. Logistic regression assessed factors associated with testing HIV positive. Patients presenting with infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome (IMS) were recruited up until September 2015.
   Results
   Of 10,877 patients presenting with an IC and included in the analysis, 303 tested positive (2.8%; 95% CI 2.5-3.1%). People presenting with an IC in Southern and Eastern Europe were more likely to test HIV positive as were people presenting with IMS, lymphadenopathy and leukocytopenia/thrombocytopenia. One third of people diagnosed with HIV after presenting with IMS reported a negative HIV test in the preceding 12 months. Of patients newly diagnosed with HIV where data was available, 92.6% were promptly linked to care; of these 10.4% were reported lost to follow up or dead 12 months after diagnosis.
   Conclusion
   The study showed that 10 conditions had HIV prevalences > 0.1%. These 10 ICs should be adopted into HIV testing and IC specialty guidelines. As IMS presentation can mimic acute HIV sero-conversion and has the highest positivity rate, this IC in particular affords opportunities for earlier diagnosis and public health benefit.

AB An evaluation of Vasterbotten Intervention Programme (VIP) was recently conducted by San Sebastian et al. (BMC Public Health 19:202, 2019). Evaluation of health care interventions of this kind require 1) an understanding of both the design and the nature of the intervention, 2) correct definition of the target population, and 3) careful choice of the appropriate evaluation method. In this correspondence, we review the approach used by San Sebastian et al. as relates to these three criteria. Within this framework, we suggest important explanations for why the conclusions drawn by these authors contradict a large body of research on the effectiveness of the VIP.

AB Background Improvement of health literacy, health behavioural change, creating a supportive physical and social environment to be more conducive to health should be the focus of child and adolescent public health. The concept of Health Promoting School initiated by World Health Organization aims to move beyond individual behavioural change and to consider organisational structure change such as improvement of the school's physical and social environment. The aim of this study is identification of the key indicators for successful implementation of Health Promoting School by analysing the findings of the school health profile based on the structured framework of Hong Kong Healthy School Award Scheme and the health status of students investigated by the Hong Kong Student Health Survey. Methods This is a retrospective correlation study. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilised to analyse for significant improvement of school health profile measured at baseline (n = 104) and among those schools implemented the Hong Kong Healthy School Award Scheme (n = 54). Those indicators showing statistical significance were chosen to be part of the core indicators reflecting effective Health Promoting School. Each of those selected core indicators was then correlated with the related student health outcomes measured by the Hong Kong Student Health Survey Questionnaire to further identify the core indicators. Results A total of 20 core indicators among all the six Key Areas of Health Promoting School (6 indicators under action competencies, 2 under community link, 2 under physical environment, 2 under social environment, 4 under healthy school policies, 1 under services of school health protection) have been identified with the method mentioned above. Conclusions This study has identified the indicators with most significant impact on a wide range of health related outcomes. Those are key indicators for motivating positive change of the schools and students. They can be considered as school performance indicators to help schools embarking their Health Promoting School journey as another key education objective.

AB Background Urban green open space is a valuable resource for physical activities of urban inhabitants and has the potential to reduce chronic illness and improve health. Research on the relationships between green open space and physical activity is incomplete and limited in China. Thus, the study examines how the urban green open space contributes to physical activity. Methods A questionnaire was designed based on the social ecology theory to investigate the physical activity of 513 residents in urban green open space. We use the time and frequency of residents exercising in urban green space to measure physical activity, and use the factor analysis to synthesize a large number of original factors (i.e., infrastructure, safety, accessibility, landscape quality, and space environment) into relatively few composite indicators. Based on the collected data of the cross-sectional population, the Order Probit regression model was constructed to analyze how urban green open space affects the residents' physical activity from the perspective of social ecology. Results 1 in community factors: accessibility is significantly positive correlation with residents' physical activity, and there is no significant correlation between safety and physical activity; 2 in natural factors: space environment and landscape quality are not significantly correlated with residents' physical activity; 3 in built environmental factors: infrastructures, the area of green space, the size of open space, and entertainment facilities are significantly correlated to residents' activity. Basketball courts, volleyball courts, swimming pools, and sports equipment will promote physical activity; 4 apart from the attributes of green open space, other factors are significantly correlated to physical activity in the green open space, e.g. having a companion. Conclusions Urban green open space plays an important role in promoting physical activity especially among the women and the old, and improving the attributes (such as accessibility, infrastructures, the area of green space, the size of open space and entertainment facilities) of the urban green open space and trying to set up group sports proper to play with companion (like "square dancing" and "Tai Chi") can promote Chinese residents' physical activity so as to improve public health. The results are significant to facilitate environment health.

AB Background Vibrio parahaemolyticus (V. parahaemolyticus) is a leading cause of food poisoning and is of great importance to public health due to the frequency and seriousness of the diseases. The simple, timely and efficient detection of this pathogen is a major concern worldwide. In this study, we established a simple and rapid method based on recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) for the determination of V. parahaemolyticus. According to the gyrB gene sequences of V. parahaemolyticus available in GenBank, specific primers and an exo probe were designed for establishing real-time recombinase polymerase amplification (real-time RPA). Results The real-time RPA reaction was performed successfully at 38 degrees C, and results were obtained within 20 min. The method only detected V. parahaemolyticus and did not show cross-reaction with other bacteria, exhibiting a high level of specificity. The study showed that the detection limit (LOD) of real-time RPA was 1.02 x 10(2) copies/reaction. For artificially contaminated samples with different bacteria concentrations, V. parahaemolyticus could be detected within 5-12 min by real-time RPA in oyster sauce, codfish and sleeve-fish at concentrations as low as 4 CFU/25 g, 1 CFU/25 g and 7 CFU/25 g, respectively, after enrichment for 6 h, but were detected in a minimum of 35 min by real-time PCR (Ct values between 27 and 32). Conclusion This study describes a simple, rapid, and reliable method for the detection of V. parahaemolyticus, which could potentially be applied in the research laboratory and disease diagnosis.

AB Background Pneumonia is a significant public health problem globally. The early identification and management of the determinants of pneumonia demands clear evidence. But, there is a limited data on this issue in the current study area. Thus, this study aimed to identify the determinants of pneumonia among 2-59 months old children at Debre Markos Referral Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A Hospital based unmatched case-control study was conducted among 334 (167 Cases and 167 Controls) children at Debre Markos Referral Hospital from February 1 to March 30, 2018. Consecutive sampling technique was employed and data were collected with a pre-tested interviewer administered questionnaire. Data were entered into Epi-Data version 4.2, and analyzed using SPSS version 25 software. Bi-variable and multi-variable logistic regression analyses were fitted. Variables having p-value < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Results A total of 328(164 cases and 164 controls) 2-59 months old children were included in this study. Not opening windows daily [AOR:6.15(2.55,14.83)], household near to the street [AOR:4.23(1.56,11.44)], child care by the house workers and relatives [AOR:2.97 (1.11,7.93)], using only water for hand washing before child feeding [AOR:3.81 (1.51, 9.66)], mixed feeding practice from birth to six months [AOR: 7.62 (2.97, 19.55)], having upper respiratory tract infection in the last 2 weeks for the child [AOR: 5.33 (2.16, 13.19)] and children with history of co- residence with URTI family [AOR: 6.17 (2.36,16.15)] were found to be determinants of pneumonia. Conclusions The main contributing factors for pneumonia in this study are preventable with no or minimal cost. Therefore, we recommend appropriate and adequate health education regarding pneumonia prevention and control.

AB Background Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) has long been a pervasive public health concern. With the aging Chinese population, the prevention, assessment and management of postmenopausal osteoporosis were particularly important. During the breastfeeding, a large amount of Calcium loss from maternal bone for infants' growth. However, whether this loss is completely reversible remains controversial. As the relationship between breastfeeding and postmenopausal osteoporosis is different from society to society and is not clear from the literature, the purpose of this study was to determine whether breastfeeding was an independent factor for the development of PMOP based on Chinese postmenopausal population. Methods A retrospective cross-sectional investigation was conducted at Tianjin Xiaobailou health Community Healthcare Center between December 2017 and June 2018. Postmenopausal women over the age of 50 who underwent the annual health examination or visited the center to perform bone densitometry as a part of routine screening for disease were recruited. A trained community nurse administered a questionnaire to all participants by face-to-face interview. Participants were questioned about age, BMI, Vitamin D and calcium intake, the history of smoking, drinking and fracture, age of menarche, age of menopause, the number of pregnancy, parity, feeding pattern (breastfeeding, artificial feeding and mixed feeding) and overall breastfeeding duration. BMD measurements were carried out using quantitative ultrasound (QUS) at the bilateral radius. Results A total of 202 women who met the inclusive and exclusive criteria were enrolled. Univariate analysis revealed that overall breastfeeding more than 24 months increased the risk of osteoporosis (OR 39.00, 95%CI 2.40-634.65, p = 0.010). However, multivariate estimate of the risk of osteoporosis by overall breastfeeding duration suggested that when controlling for age, BMI, the number of pregnancy and parity, the overall breastfeeding duration was not an independent risk factor for postmenopausal osteoporosis (OR 5.22, 95%CI 0.18-147.76, p = 0.333). Additionally, age (OR 1.16, 95%CI 1.05-1.29, p = 0.003), BMI (OR 1.26, 95%CI 1.04-1.54, p = 0.021) and the number of pregnancy (OR 1.80, 95%CI 1.08-2.98, p = 0.024) were significant associated with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Conclusion Breastfeeding was not associated with postmenopausal osteoporosis, while age, BMI and the number of pregnancy may contribute to increasing risk of postmenopausal osteoporosis in Chinese women.

ID UNITED-STATES; MORTALITY; CHILD; MALTREATMENT
AB Although injury-related deaths have been documented among children and adult populations, insufficient attention has been directed towards injury-related infant deaths. The objective of this retrospective study was to investigate maternal and infant characteristics associated with injury-related infant deaths in West Virginia. Birth and infant mortality data for 2010-2014 were sourced from the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health, Charleston. Relative risk was calculated using log-binomial regression utilizing generalized estimating equations. Maternal characteristics associated with injury-related infant mortality in West Virginia were race/ethnicity (X-df=2(2) = 7.48, p = .03), and smoking during pregnancy (X-df=1(2) = 13.1, p < .00). Risk of a Black Non-Hispanic infant suffering an injury-related death was 4.0 (95% CL 1.7, 9.3) times that of infants of other races/ethnicities. Risk of an infant dying from an injury-related cause, if the mother smoked during pregnancy, was 2.9 (95% CL 1.6, 5.0) times the risk of such a death if maternal smoking status during pregnancy is unknown or no smoking, controlling for race/ethnicity. This study provides important information to public health stakeholders at both the state and local levels in designing interventions for partial reduction or prevention of injury-related infant mortality in West Virginia.

AB Introduction
   End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is increasing globally, and renal transplantation (RT) is the preferred renal replacement therapy to treat ESRD. Internationally, there are only a few countries with RT rates above 50 per million population (pmp), while most of the countries have RT rates between 30-40 pmp. The low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) makes up the majority for the RT rates below 20 pmp in which Malaysia belongs to despite its increasing ESRD rates. There is a need to explore the barriers to access RT with targeted solutions to improve the RT rates and service in LMIC. Thus, a qualitative study was undertaken in Malaysia to address this issue.
   Method
   A qualitative methodological approach was performed between March-May 2018. Semi-structured interviews were used to explore current RT policy and service availability. Key-informants were identified from a detailed stakeholder analysis of RT system in Malaysia. Interviews were digitally audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, coded with ATLAS.ti software and underwent thematic analysis thoroughly.
   Results
   Eight key-informants participated in the study. Barriers and related solutions were classified using the socio-ecological model (SEM). As reported, the barriers and solutions of RT in Malaysia are the results of a complex interplay of personal, cultural, and environmental factors. Key barriers are linked to public's attitude and perception towards RT and the unaccommodating practices in the healthcare fraternity for RT. Key-informants provided a systematic solution that shed light on how RT could be improved at each SEM level via effective communication, education and inter-agency collaboration.
   Conclusion
   The SEM provided a framework to foster a better understanding of current practice, barriers, and solutions to RT in Malaysia. This study is the first to explore the barriers and related solutions to RT comprehensively as a whole. Implications of these findings could prompt a policy change for a better RT service delivery model not just for Malaysia but also for other LMIC. Further stakeholder engagement and evaluation of the systems are required to provide insight into best practices that will help to improve the RT rates and service in Malaysia.

AB Since 2013, epidemics caused by novel H7N9 avian influenza A viruses (AIVs) have become a considerable public health issue. This study investigated the evolution of these viruses at the population level. Compared to H7 and N9 before 2013, there were 18 and 24 substitutions in the majority of novel H7N9 AIVs, respectively. Nine of these in HA and six in NA were rare before 2013, and four of these in HA and two in NA displayed host tropism. S136(128) N and A143(135) V are located on the receptor binding sites of the HA1 subunit and might be important factors in determining the host species of novel H7N9 AIV. On an overall scale, the evolution of H7 and N9, both in terms of time distribution and host species, is under negative selection. However, both in HA and NA, several sites were under positive selection. In both the overall epidemics and the human-derived H7N9 AIVs, eight positive selection sites were identified in HA1, with some located within the known antigen epitopes or the receptor binding site(RBS) domain. This may induce variations in H7N9 AIV with positive selection. It is necessary to strengthen the surveillance of novel H7N9 AIVs, both in human and bird population to determine whether a new virus has emerged through selection pressure and to prevent future epidemics from occurring.

AB Background
   The Thailand National Strategic Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) 2017-2021, endorsed by the Thai Cabinet in 2016, aims to increase public knowledge about antibiotics and AMR awareness by 20% by 2021. This study assesses the prevalence of antibiotics use, clinical indications and sources; knowledge and access to information related to antibiotics and AMR; and factors related to level of knowledge and access to information among Thai adult population.
   Methods
   An AMR module was developed and embedded into the 2017 Health and Welfare Survey; a cross-sectional, two-stage stratified sampling, nationally representative household survey carried out biannually by National Statistical Office. The survey applied a structured interview questionnaire. The survey was conducted in March 2017 where 27,762 Thai adults were interviewed of the AMR module. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.
   Results
   The one-month prevalence of antibiotic use was 7.9% for three common conditions; flu (27.0%), fever (19.2%) and sore throat (16.8%). The majority of antibiotics (70.3%) were provided by public or private healthcare facilities, and 26.7% by pharmacies. Thai adults have low levels of knowledge about antibiotics; only 2.6 gave correct answers to all six statements related to antibiotics, while 13.5% gave wrong answers to all six statements. A few factors associated with knowledge and having received information on antibiotics were assessed. People who have higher education levels, and belong to richer wealth quintiles, and receive antibiotics and AMR information have significantly higher levels of knowledge about antibiotics. In the last 12 months, only 17.8% of respondents had heard information about the proper use of antibiotics and AMR; mostly from doctors (36.1%), health workers (24.8%) and pharmacists (17.7%).
   Conclusions
   There is a large gap of public knowledge about the use of antibiotics. The main communication channel is through healthcare professionals, which indicates they are key persons in communicating information about the proper use of antibiotics to the public.

   A qualitative study using in-depth, face-to-face, and semi-structured interviews with 15 physicians held in July 2017 at a tertiary care hospital in Jazan, the distal south-western province in Saudi Arabia. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, coded using the qualitative software NVivo11 and analysed thematically. Data saturation was assumed as no new understandings of the broad thematic issues were produced by the last three interviews.
   Results
   Themes identified were: Knowledge, Resistance, Barriers and Facilitators. Participants acknowledged their lack of awareness of available guidelines and their lack of training and education about Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I). They highlighted a lack of education for patients about insomnia and its treatment. Beliefs about dependence on hypnotics and the inappropriateness of international guidelines for Saudi Arabia inclined many to resist using them. Inability to document diagnosis and consultations due to limited time and lack of suitable electronic systems, lack of suitably trained practitioners for referral for CBT-I, and lack of accountability for practice were identified as key barriers to following international guidelines. Development of national guidelines was the most important facilitator suggested by participants.
   Conclusions
   The health authorities in the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) should improve general public awareness about sleep disorders and provide focused training for specialists and technologists. Above all, KSA needs its own nationwide guidelines for treating sleep-disorders based on evidence-based clinical trials, consistent with its history, culture, socioeconomic conditions and traditions.

AB Background
   Perceived as a minor transportation mode mainly for recreation, cycling and its related safety issues have not been treated as a citywide concern in Hong Kong and have thus received inadequate research efforts. Our study aimed to illuminate the safety challenges faced by cyclists in Hong Kong.
   Methods
   We examined the police crash records from 1998 to 2017 and developed a Bayesian Poisson state space model to evaluate the longitudinal change in traffic injuries to cyclists. We then used quasi-induced exposure to measure the annual relative risk of crash involvement for cycling. Based on an officially published travel characteristics survey, we further measured the risk of injury for cycling per minutes cycled.
   Results
   Between 1998 and 2017, Hong Kong witnessed a more than twofold increase in the number of cyclist injuries, with an average annual increase rate of 5.18% (95% CI: 0.53%-12.77%). By 2017, cyclists were 2.21 (1.82-2.69) times more likely to be involved in traffic crashes than in 1998. Per 10 million minutes, the injury rates for cycling were 28.64 (27.43-29.70) and 42.54 (41.07-44.02) on weekdays during 2001-2003 and 2010-2012. After adjusting for sex and age groups, cyclists were 1.95 (1.43-2.61) times more likely to be injured in 2010-2012 than in 2001-2003. Per minutes traveled, cyclists also sustained significantly higher risks of fatality and injury than pedestrians, private car drivers and passengers, taxi passengers, public bus passengers, and minibus passengers. A comparison of Hong Kong with other regions suggests that Hong Kong is among the most dangerous areas for cycling in terms of fatality rate per minutes cycled.
   Conclusions
   Cyclist injuries have become a substantial public health burden in Hong Kong. A range of countermeasures with proven effectiveness should be promptly implemented to improve the safety of these vulnerable road users.

TI The effectiveness of financial intervention strategies for reducing

AB Background: The increasing trend of Caesarean section (CS) in childbirth has become a global public health challenge. Previous studies have proposed financial intervention strategies for reducing CS rates by limiting caesarean delivery on maternal request (CDMR). This study synthesizes such strategies while evaluating their effectiveness.
   Methods: The sources of data for this study are Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL. The publication period included in this study is from January 1991 to November 2018. The financial intervention strategies are divide into two categories: healthcare provider interventions and patient interventions. Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) was employed to assess the risk of bias of included studies. The outcome of each study was evaluated with Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) through the GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool software.
   Results: Nine studies were included in this systematic review: five with high certainty evidence (HCE), three with moderate certainty evidence (MCE), and one with low certainty evidence (LCE). Of the nine studies, seven are centered on the effect of provider-side interventions. Three of the HCE studies found that the diagnosis-related group payment system, risk-adjusted capitation, and equalizing fee for both facilities and physicians were effective intervention strategies. One HCE and one MCE study showed that only equalizing facility fees between vaginal and CS deliveries in healthcare service settings had no significant effect on reducing the CS rate. The MCE study showed that case payment had a negative effect on reducing the CS rates. One LCE study revealed that the effect of a global budget system was uncertain, and one HCE and one MCE study focused on combining both provider and patient-side interventions. However, equalizing fees for vaginal and CS deliveries and a co-payment policy for CDMRs failed to reduce the CS rate.
   Conclusions: The effectiveness of risk-adjusted payment methods appears promising and should be the subject of further research. Financial interventions should consider stakeholders' characteristics, especially the personal interests of doctors. Finally, high-quality randomized control trials and comparative studies on different financial intervention methods are needed to confirm or refute previous studies' outcomes.

AB Background: Gambling for money is a popular leisure time activity in most countries, which has major social and economic impacts not only affecting the gambler, but his/her significant others, and the society. Gambling impact studies can help researchers and policymakers compare the health and social costs and benefits of different gambling policies and can be used when considering which gambling policies will reduce or increase costs or benefits the most. In a public health approach, the impacts of gambling, negative and positive, are assessed across the entire severity spectrum of the activity. Although some studies have created basic principles for conducting impact studies, a theoretical model is currently lacking. The aim of this debate is to review complementing and contrasting views on the effects of gambling to create a conceptual model, where a public health perspective is applied.
   Main text: The effects of gambling can be structuralized using a conceptual model, where impacts are divided into negative and positive; costs and benefits. Costs and benefits are categorized into three classes: financial, labor and health, and well-being. These classes manifest in personal, interpersonal, and societal levels. Individual impacts cause effects on a personal level to gamblers themselves. External impacts influence the interpersonal and society/community levels and concern other people. The temporal level refers to the development, severity and scope of the gambling impact. These include general impacts, impacts of problem gambling and long-term impacts of gambling.
   Conclusions: The conceptual model offers a base on which to start building common methodology for assessing the impact of gambling on the society. While measuring monetary impacts is not always straightforward, the main issue is how to measure the social impacts, which are typically ignored in calculations, as are personal and interpersonal impacts. The reviewed empirical work largely concentrated on the costs of gambling, especially costs on the community level. The Model can be used to identify areas where research is scarce. Filling the gaps in knowledge is essential in forming a balanced evidence base on the impacts of gambling. Ideally, this evidence could be the starting point in formulating public policies on gambling.

ID ANTENATAL CARE; WOMEN; MEN
AB Background Male partner involvement has been shown to increase mothers' uptake of Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV (PMTCT) and improve maternal and infant HIV treatment outcomes. Currently, male involvement in PMTCT is measured primarily through men's attendance at HIV testing and counselling which may not be a true reflection of their engagement. This study therefore set out to explore the meaning of male partner involvement and propose a definition and theoretical model of this concept in PMTCT in Uganda. Methods Eight focus group discussions and five in-depth interviews were conducted with couples at three public health facilities and community members in the health facility catchment areas in Uganda. The study employed a grounded theory approach underpinned by the pragmatic philosophical paradigm. Data were analyzed using the constant comparative method, performing three levels of open, axial, and selective coding. Results Of the 61 participants, 29 (48%) were male and the majority 39 (63.9%) were in long term marital relationships, while about half were self-employed 29 (47.5%). Three themes emerged for the meaning of male involvement in PMTCT (a) HIV treatment support (b) economic support and (c) psychosocial support. HIV treatment support included adherence support, couples' HIV counseling and testing, and clinic attendance during and after pregnancy. Participants expressed that men were engaged in PMTCT when they offered economic support by providing basic needs and finances or when they included their female partners in financial planning for the family. Psychosocial support arose from the female participants who defined male involvement as family support, perceived societal recognition and emotional support. Emotional support also included the absence of harm resulting from women's disclosure of HIV test results to their male partner. Conclusions This study proposes a new definition for male partner involvement in PMTCT in Uganda. The definition extends beyond men's clinic attendance and HIV testing and counselling. Further research should seek to develop and validate tools to accurately measure male partner involvement as the next step in the development of interventions to improve PMTCT outcomes.

SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH

DT Article
DE Sustainability; Nigeria; Family planning; Urban; Quality
AB Background To date, there is little information on the sustainability of family planning (FP) service quality after completion of a donor-funded program. This paper examines the sustainability of the Nigerian Urban Reproductive Health Initiative (NURHI) program on quality of FP services in two cities: Ilorin, where the program ended in March 2015 and Kaduna where the program continued. Methods Data come from three time periods: 2011, before program implementation; 2014, near Phase 1 completion; and 2017, two-years post Phase 1. In 2011, we undertook a facility audit and provider surveys in all public sector facilities in each city as well as all private facilities mentioned as the source for FP or maternal, newborn, and child health services in a 2010 women's household survey. In 2014 and 2017, we returned to the same facilities to undertake the facility audit and provider surveys. Quality is measured from principal component analyses of 30 items from the facility audit and provider surveys. Service use outcomes are measured as the ratio of FP clients (total and new) to the number of reproductive health staff members. Multivariate random effect models are estimated to examine changes in the outcomes over time, between NURHI and non-NURHI facilities and by city. Results We demonstrate that NURHI facilities had better quality and higher service use than non-NURHI facilities. Further, while quality of services was higher in Ilorin in 2011, by 2014 and three years later (2017), the quality was better in Kaduna where the program continued. In addition, while no difference was found in service utilization between Ilorin and Kaduna in 2014, by 2017, Kaduna had significantly more new FP users than Ilorin. Conclusions In Ilorin, quality of services did not continue its strong upward trend after the program ended. Programs need to consider long-term strategies that support continuation of program components post program implementation. This may include ensuring continued training of providers and addressing equipment and commodity stock-outs through system changes rather than specific facility-level changes. The findings from this study can be used to inform future programs seeking to improve quality of FP services in a sustainable manner.

AB Background A debate on the decision of women to choose a cesarean section as the mode of birth in uncomplicated pregnancies from the views of relevant stakeholders. Main text Using five electronic databases, a literature search was conducted for studies published from January 2003 to December 2016. Studies on a woman's right to request or to choose a cesarean section as the mode of birth in uncomplicated pregnancies were included. Fifty-five articles were identified (39 research studies and 16 opinion-based articles). Among health professionals, obstetricians were the most supportive of this right. It is argued that although women reported wanting to choose the mode of birth, with the safety of their babies as the priority, they also relied on the advice of their maternity care provider and considered it the responsibility of their obstetrician to make the decision. A higher proportion of the general public in countries with well-developed private healthcare accepted that a woman should have the freedom to choose the mode of birth. Conclusions This review provided a debate on the choice of pregnant women in uncomplicated pregnancies on the mode of birth from various stakeholders. Further research is required to explore what the meanings of autonomy of pregnant women to choose the mode of birth, and the process that they go through when making this decision.

AB Background In recent times, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases are posing a public health threat in developing countries, and vigilant surveillance is necessary to prepare against these threats. Analyses of multi-year comprehensive infectious disease syndrome data are required in Mongolia, but have not been conducted till date. This study aimed to describe the trends in the incidence of infectious disease syndromes in Mongolia during 2009-2017 using a nationwide syndrome surveillance system for infectious diseases established in 2009. Methods We analyzed time trends using monthly data on the incidence of infectious disease syndromes such as acute fever with rash (AFR), acute fever with vesicular rash (AFVR), acute jaundice (AJ), acute watery diarrhea (AWD), acute bloody diarrhea (ABD), foodborne disease (FD) and nosocomial infection (NI) reported from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2017. Time series forecasting models based on the data up to 2017 estimated the future trends in the incidence of syndromes up to December 2020. Results During the study, the overall prevalence of infectious disease syndromes was 71.8/10,000 population nationwide. The average number of reported infectious disease syndromes was 14,519 (5229-55,132) per year. The major types were AFR (38.7%), AFVR (31.7%), AJ (13.9%), ABD (10.2%), and AWD (1.8%), accounting for 96.4% of all reported syndromes. The most prevalent syndromes were AJ between 2009 and 2012 (59.5-48.7%), AFVR between 2013 and 2014 (54.5-59%), AFR between 2015 and 2016 (67.6-65.9%), and AFVR in 2017 (62.2%). There were increases in the prevalence of AFR, with the monthly number of cases being 37.7 +/- 6.1 during 2015-2016; this could be related to the measles outbreak in Mongolia during that period. The AFVR incidence rate showed winter's multiplicative seasonal fluctuations with a peak of 10.6 +/- 2 cases per 10,000 population in 2017. AJ outbreaks were identified in 2010, 2011, and 2012, and these could be associated with hepatitis A outbreaks. Prospective time series forecasting showed increasing trends in the rates of AFVR and ABD. Conclusions The evidence-based method for infectious disease syndromes was useful in gaining an understanding of the current situation, and predicting the future trends of various infectious diseases in Mongolia.

AB Background
   Tuberculosis (TB), a bacterial infectious disease, continues to be a public health concern in many developing countries. However, lack of data concerning the public health burden and potential risk factors for the disease hampers control programs in target areas. Therefore, the aims of present study were to determine the prevalence of TB and genetic diversity of M. tuberculosis isolates from individuals visiting health facilities in South Gondar Zone, north-west Ethiopia.
   Methods
   A cross-sectonal study was conducted between March 2015 and April 2017. Bacteriological examination, region of difference (RD) 9 based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and spoligotyping were used.
   Results
   The overall prevalence of all smear positive TB was 6.3% (186/2953). Extra pulmonary TB (EPTB) was clinically characterized in about 62.4% (116/186) TB-positive cases. Some demographic characteristics, such as patients' origin (districts where patients were recruited) [patients' origin (chi-square (chi(2)) value; 62.8, p<0.001) were found to be significantly associated risk factors for the occurrence of TB in the study area. All the mycobacterial isolates were found to be M. tuberculosis. Among the 35 different spoligotype patterns identified, 22 patterns were shared types. The three dominantly identified families were T, CAS and Manu, each consisting of 46.9%, 24.0% and 10.4% of the isolates, respectively.
   Conclusion
   The present study revealed that TB continues to be a public health problem in South Gondar Zone which suggests a need of implementing effective disease control strategies.

TI Gut microbiome response to a modern Paleolithic diet in a Western
   lifestyle context
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID INFLAMMATION; IMPACT
AB The modern Paleolithic diet (MPD), featured by the consumption of vegetables, fruit, nuts, seeds, eggs, fish and lean meat, while excluding grains, dairy products, salt and refined sugar, has gained substantial public attention in recent years because of its potential multiple health benefits. However, to date little is known about the actual impact of this dietary pattern on the gut microbiome (GM) and its implications for human health. In the current scenario where Western diets, low in fiber while rich in industrialized and processed foods, are considered one of the leading causes of maladaptive GM changes along human evolution, likely contributing to the increasing incidence of chronic non-communicable diseases, we hypothesize that the MPD could modulate the Western GM towards a more "ancestral" configuration. In an attempt to shed light on this, here we profiled the GM structure of urban Italian subjects adhering to the MPD, and compared data with other urban Italians following a Mediterranean Diet (MD), as well as worldwide traditional hunter-gatherer populations from previous publications. Notwithstanding a strong geography effect on the GM structure, our results show an unexpectedly high degree of biodiversity in MPD subjects, which well approximates that of traditional populations. The GM of MPD individuals also shows some peculiarities, including a high relative abundance of bile-tolerant and fat-loving microorganisms. The consumption of plant-based foods-albeit with the exclusion of grains and pulses-along with the minimization of the intake of processed foods, both hallmarks of the MPD, could therefore contribute to partially rewild the GM but caution should be taken in adhering to this dietary pattern in the long term.

AB Smallholder large ruminant production in Lao People's Democratic Republic (Laos) is characterised by low reproductive efficiency. To determine if common abortifacient bovid infectious diseases are involved, a serological investigation was conducted. Sera was collected from stored and fresh cattle (n = 390) and buffalo (n = 130) samples from 2016-18 from, and then examined for associations in a retrospective risk factor study of 71 herds. The sera were assayed for antibodies to Neospora caninum, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), Leptospira interrogans serovar Hardjo and Brucella abortus using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. These pathogens were detected in buffalo samples at 78.5% (95% CI 71.4-85.6), 0%, 2.3% (95% CI 0-4.9) and 0%, respectively, and in cattle at 4.4% (95% CI 2.4-6.4), 7.7% (95% CI 3.1-12.3), 12.8% (95% CI 9.5-16.1) and 0.26% (95% CI 0-0.8), respectively. Exposure of buffalo to N. caninum was positively associated with buffalo age, with a predicted seropositivity at birth of 52.8%, increasing to 97.2% by 12 years of age (p = 0.037). Exposure of cattle to L. interrogans serovar Hardjo was more prevalent in females compared to males, was associated with higher titres of BVDV, and was more prevalent in the wet season compared to the dry season. Exposure of cattle to BVDV was more prevalent in males compared to females, the wet and dry seasons were comparable, and was associated with rising antibody titres against N. caninum and L. interrogans serovar Hardjo. The risk factor survey identified that the probability of herds being N. caninum positive increased with farmer age, if farmers believed there were rodents on farm, and if farmers weren't aware that canids or rodents could contaminate bovid feed on their farm. The probability of a herd being positive to L. interrogans serovar Hardjo increased on farms where multiple cows shared the same bull, where farmers had lower husbandry knowledge, and on farms that used water troughs. The probability of a herd being BVDV seropositive increased with increasing herd size and increasing titres to N. caninum. The benchmarking of bovid exposure to emerging abortifacient pathogens and identification of their risk factors potentially informs disease prevention strategies, supporting efforts to establish a biosecure beef supply for enhanced smallholder livestock productivity, public health and food security in Laos and surrounding countries.

AB Background: Children's centres in the UK provide a setting for public health programmes; offering support to families living in the most disadvantaged areas where obesity prevalence is at its highest. Health, Exercise and Nutrition in the Really Young (HENRY) is an eight-week obesity prevention programme currently delivered in children's centres across the UK. However, low participant engagement in some local authorities threatens its potential reach and impact. This study aimed to explore the factors influencing participant engagement with HENRY to describe where local intervention may support engagement efforts.
   Method: A focused ethnography study was undertaken in five children's centres delivering HENRY across the UK. One hundred and ninety hours of field observations, 22 interviews with staff (commissioners, HENRY co-ordinators, managers and facilitators) and six focus groups (36 parents), took place over five consecutive days in each centre. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used to guide the observations and analysis of the data.
   Results: Three overarching themes described the factors influencing participant engagement with HENRY: local authority decision making around children's centre programmes; children's centre implementation of HENRY; and the participant experience of HENRY. The results indicate that factors influencing participant engagement with public health programmes begin at the commissioning body level, influencing children's centre implementation and subsequently the experience of participants. Local authority funding priorities and constraints influence availability of places and who these places are offered to, with funding often targeted towards those deemed most at need. This was perceived to have a detrimental effect on participant experience of the programme.
   Conclusion: In summary, participant engagement is affected by multiple factors, working at different levels of the children's centre and local authority hierarchy, most of which are at play even before participants decide whether or not they choose to enrol and maintain attendance. For programmes to achieve their optimal reach and impact, factors at the commissioning and local implementation level need to be addressed prior to addressing participant facing issues.

   eligible for subsidized dental care - a qualitative study

LA English
DT Article
DE Elderly; Dental care subsidies; Older population; Dental care
   utilisation
ID ORAL-HEALTH; ACCESS; PEOPLE
AB Background: The World Health Organization has highlighted the paucity of research into the oral health needs of older adults. In Singapore, until recently, publically funded/subsidized oral health care for adults has been limited to basic primary care at government-funded polyclinics. Access to a more comprehensive range of subsidized care in the private sector was widened through the government-funded Community Health Assistance Scheme (CHAS) in 2012 and Pioneer Generation (PG) scheme in 2015. Little is known about the attitude to dental service utilization among older adults in Singapore since then.
   Methods: We conducted semi-structured individual interviews with 25 participants above 65 years of age who were eligible for subsidized dental care plans. Participants were recruited from a public teaching hospital and a public primary care clinic in Singapore. The duration of each interview was 15-30 min. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and the transcripts were analyzed thematically using a phenomenological approach.
   Results: Pertinent themes emerged related to four major areas: (a) general awareness towards oral health, (b) life course perspective of oral health, (c) barriers to visit the dentist, (d) shaping dental service utilisation behaviours through provision of financial subsidies for dental care. Most participants perceived a strong relationship between oral health and systemic health. However, there were erroneous traditional beliefs such as oral health is not part of physical health and edentulous participants did not need to visit a dentist. Fear, anxiety, previous negative experience and lack of knowledge were barriers to visiting the dentist. Trust and convenience were considerations for patients when deciding whether to switch from public to private dental services where CHAS/PG were only available.
   Conclusion: Our study provided important insights regarding oral health perceptions and beliefs of older people residing in the community which may affect their dental service utilization. This further highlights the importance of understanding the concerns of this group when implementing healthcare policies for elderly in Singapore. The findings of our study will serve as a baseline for future studies in Singapore and inform studies in other countries that implement targeted schemes for older adults.

AB Background: The minimum wage creates both winners (through wage increases) and-potentially-losers (through job losses). Research on the health effects of minimum wage policies has been sparse, particularly across gender and among racial/ethnic minorities. We test the impact of minimum wage increases on health outcomes, health behaviors and access to healthcare across gender and race/ethnicity.
   Methods: Using 1993-2014 data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, variables for access to healthcare (insurance coverage, missed care due to cost), health behavior (exercise, fruit, vegetable and alcohol consumption) and health outcomes (self-reported fair/poor health, hypertension, poor physical health days, poor mental health days, unhealthy days) were regressed on the product of the ratio of the 1-year lagged minimum wage to the state median wage and the national median wage, using Linear Probability Models and Poisson Regression Models for dichotomous and count outcomes, respectively. Regressions (total population, gender-stratified, race/ethnicity stratified (white, black, Latino), gender/race/ethnicity stratified and total population with interaction terms for race/ethnicity/gender) controlled for state-level ecologic variables, individual-level demographics and fixed-effects (state and year).
   Results were adjusted for complex survey design and Bonferroni corrections were applied to p-values such that the level of statistical significance for a given outcome category was 0.05 divided by the number of outcomes in that category. Results: Minimum wage increases were positively associated with access to care among white men, black women and Latino women but negatively associated with access to care among white women and black men. With respect to dietary quality, minimum wage increases were associated with improvements, mixed results and negative impacts among white, Latino and black men, respectively. With respect to health outcomes, minimum wage increases were associated with positive, negative and mixed impacts among white women, white men and Latino men, respectively.
   Conclusions: While there is enthusiasm for minimum wage increases in the public health community, such increases may have to be paired with deliberate strategies to protect workers that might be vulnerable to economic dislocation. Such strategies may include more robust unemployment insurance or increased access to job training for displaced workers.

AB Background Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major public health problem in correctional settings. HCV treatment is often not possible in U.S. jails due to short lengths of stay. Linkage to care is crucial in these settings, but competing priorities complicate community healthcare engagement and retention after incarceration. Methods We conducted a single arm clinical trial of a combined transitional care coordination (TCC) and patient navigation intervention and assessed the linkage rate and factors associated with linkage to HCV care after incarceration. Results During the intervention, 84 participants returned to the community after their index incarceration. Most participants were male and Hispanic, with a history of mental illness and a mean age of 45 years. Of those who returned to the community, 26 (31%) linked to HCV care within a median of 20.5 days; 17 (20%) initiated HCV treatment, 15 (18%) completed treatment, 9 (11%) had a follow-up lab drawn to confirm sustained virologic response (SVR), and 7 (8%) had a documented SVR. Among those with follow-up labs the known SVR rate was (7/9) 78%. Expressing a preference to be linked to the participant's existing health system, being on methadone prior to incarceration, and feeling that family or a loved one were concerned about the participant's wellbeing were associated with linkage to HCV care. Reporting drinking alcohol to intoxication prior to incarceration was negatively associated with linkage to HCV care. Conclusion We demonstrate that an integrated strategy with combined TCC and patient navigation may be effective in achieving timely linkage to HCV care. Additional multicomponent interventions aimed at treatment of substance use disorders and increasing social support could lead to further improvement.

AB Background Hepatitis C infection is a major public health concern globally. In Ireland, like other European countries, people who use drugs (PWUD) and prisoners carry a larger HCV disease burden than the general population. Recent advances in HCV management have made HCV elimination across Europe a realistic goal. Engaging these two marginalised and underserved populations remains a challenge. The aim of this review was to map key findings and identify gaps in the literature (published and unpublished) on HCV infection in Irish PWUD and prisoners. Methods A scoping review guided by the methodological framework set out by Levac and colleagues (based on previous work by Arksey & O'Malley). Results A total of 58 studies were identified and divided into the following categories; Epidemiology, Guidelines and Policy, Treatment Outcomes, HCV-related Health Issues and qualitative research reporting on Patients' and Health Providers' Experiences. This review identified significantly higher rates of HCV infection among Irish prisoners and PWUD than the general population. There are high levels of undiagnosed and untreated HCV infection in both groups. There is poor engagement by Irish PWUD with HCV services and barriers have been identified. Prison hepatology nurse services have a positive impact on treatment uptake and outcomes. Identified gaps in the literature include; lack of accurate epidemiological data on incident infection, untreated chronic HCV infection particularly in PWUD living outside Dublin and those not engaged with OST. Conclusion Ireland like other European countries has high levels of undiagnosed and untreated HCV infection. Collecting, synthesising and identifying gaps in the available literature is timely and will inform national HCV screening, treatment and prevention strategies.

AB Background The SELPHI study (An HIV Self-Testing Public Health Intervention) is an online randomised controlled trial (RCT) of HIV self-testing (HIVST). The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of recruiting UK men who have sex with men (cis and trans) and trans women who have sex with men to the SELPHI pilot, and the acceptability of the HIVST intervention used among those randomised to receive a kit. Methods A mixed-methods approach to assessing trial feasibility and intervention acceptability was taken, using quantitative data from advertising sources and RCT surveys alongside qualitative data from a nested sub-study. Results Online recruitment and intervention delivery was feasible. The recruitment strategy led to the registration of 1370 participants of whom 76% (1035) successfully enrolled and were randomised 60/40 to baseline testing vs no baseline testing. Advertising platforms performed variably. Reported HIVST kit use increased from 83% at two weeks to 96% at three months. Acceptability was very high across all quantitative measures. Participants described the instructions as easy to use, and the testing process as simple. The support structures in SELPHI were felt to be adequate. Described emotional responses to HIVST varied. Conclusions Recruiting to a modest sized HIVST pilot RCT is feasible, and the recruitment, intervention and HIVST kit were acceptable. Research on support needs of individuals with reactive results is warranted.

AB Background Dietary supplements (DSs) are widely used. However, consumers know little about the safety and efficacy of DSs. There is a growing interest in accessing health information online; however, health information, especially online information on DSs, is scattered with varying levels of quality. In our previous work, we prototyped a web application, ALOHA, with interactive graph-based visualization to facilitate consumers' browsing of the integrated DIetary Supplement Knowledge base (iDISK) curated from scientific resources, following an iterative user-centered design (UCD) process. Methods Following UCD principles, we carried out two design iterations to enrich the functionalities of ALOHA and enhance its usability. For each iteration, we conducted a usability assessment and design session with a focus group of 8-10 participants and evaluated the usability with a modified System Usability Scale (SUS). Through thematic analysis, we summarized the identified usability issues and conducted a heuristic evaluation to map them to the Gerhardt-Powals' cognitive engineering principles. We derived suggested improvements from each of the usability assessment session and enhanced ALOHA accordingly in the next design iteration. Results The SUS score in the second design iteration decreased to 52.2 +/- 11.0 from 63.75 +/- 7.2 in our original work, possibly due to the high number of new functionalities we introduced. By refining existing functionalities to make the user interface simpler, the SUS score increased to 64.4 +/- 7.2 in the third design iteration. All participants agreed that such an application is urgently needed to address the gaps in how DS information is currently organized and consumed online. Moreover, most participants thought that the graph-based visualization in ALOHA is a creative and visually appealing format to obtain health information. Conclusions In this study, we improved a novel interactive visualization platform, ALOHA, for the general public to obtain DS-related information through two UCD design iterations. The lessons learned from the two design iterations could serve as a guide to further enhance ALOHA and the development of other knowledge graph-based applications. Our study also showed that graph-based interactive visualization is a novel and acceptable approach to end-users who are interested in seeking online health information of various domains.

AB Background Salmonella enterica is regarded as a major public health threat worldwide. Salmonella secretes the novel translocated effector protein K2 (SseK2), but it is unclear whether this protein plays a significant role in Salmonella enterica Typhimurium virulence. Results A Delta sseK2 mutant of S. Typhimurium exhibited similar growth curves, adhesion and invasive ability compared with wild-type (WT) bacteria. However, deletion of sseK2 rendered Salmonella deficient in biofilm formation and the early proliferative capacity of the Delta sseK2 mutant was significantly lower than that of the WT strain. In vivo, the LD50 (median lethal dose) of the Delta sseK2 mutant strain was increased 1.62 x 10(3)-fold compared with the WT strain. In addition, vaccinating mice with the Delta sseK2 mutant protected them against challenge with a lethal dose of the WT strain. The ability of the Delta sseK2 mutant strain to induce systemic infection was highly attenuated compared with the WT strain, and the bacterial load in the animals' internal organs was lower when they were infected with the Delta sseK2 mutant strain than when they were infected with the WT strain. Conclusions We conclude that sseK2 is a virulence-associated gene that plays a vital role in Salmonella virulence.

AB Background Despite advances in operative techniques and preoperative care, proximal femur fractures (PFF) still represent a great public health problem. Displacement and fracture stability have been assumed as important determinants of treatment modality and outcome in such fractures. Purpose of this study was to determine whether the radiological severity of PFF fractures has increased over time. Methods In a cohort study, the plain radiographs of all patients with PFF aged over 50 years who were admitted to Umea University Hospital in 1981/82, 2002 and 2012 were recruited to examine the types of fractures. Results The ratio of undisplaced to displaced femoral neck (FN) fractures was 30 to 70% in 1981/82, 28 to 72% in 2002 and 25 to 75% in 2012. The ratio of stable to unstable intertrochanteric (IT) fractures was 64 to 36% in 1981/82, 68 to 32% in 2002 and 75 to 25% in 2012. The ratio of simple to comminute subtrochanteric fractures was 35 to 65% in 1981/82, 16 to 84% in 2002 and 12 to 88% in 2012. In both FN and IT fractures we found no statistical difference among these 3 study periods, p = 0.67 and p = 0.40. In subtrochanteric fractures we saw a tendency towards more comminute subtrochanteric fractures (1981/82 to 2012), p = 0.09. Conclusions We found no significant increment in the radiological severity of FN and IT over a 30 years' period. However, there was tendency towards an increase in comminute subtrochanteric fractures.

AB Background Stroke is the second-leading global cause of death behind heart disease in 2013 and is a major cause of permanent disability. The burden of stroke in terms of mortality, morbidity and disability is increasing across the world. It is currently observed to be one of the commonest reasons of admission in many health care setups and becoming an alarming serious public health problem in our country Ethiopia. Despite the high burden of strokes globally, there is insufficient information on the current clinical profile of stroke in low and middle income countries (LMICs) including Ethiopia. So, this study was aimed to assess risk factors, clinical presentations and predictors of stroke subtypes among adult patients admitted to stroke unit of Jimma university medical center (JUMC). Methods Prospective observational study design was carried out at stroke unit (SU) of JUMC for 4 consecutive months from March 10-July 10, 2017. A standardized data extraction checklist and patient interview was used to collect data. Data was entered into Epi data version 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of stroke subtypes. Result A total of 116 eligible stroke patients were recruited during the study period. The mean age of the patients was 55.1 +/- 14.0 years and males comprised 62.9%. According to world health organization (WHO) criteria of stroke diagnosis, 51.7% of patients had ischemic while 48.3% had hemorrhagic stroke. The most common risk factor identified was hypertension (75.9%) followed by family history (33.6%), alcohol intake (22.4%), smoking (17.2%) and heart failure (17.2%). The most common clinical presentation was headache complained by 75.0% of the patients followed by aphasia 60.3% and hemiparesis 53.4%. Atrial fibrillation was the independent predictor of hemorrhagic stroke (AOR: 0.08, 95% CI: 0.01-0.68). Conclusion The clinical characteristics of stroke in this set up were similar to other low- and middle-resource countries. As stroke is a high priority chronic disease, large-scale public health campaign should be launched focusing on public education regarding stroke risk factors and necessary interventions.

AB Background Major mental disorders in prison populations have been recognised as a long-term problem with an important impact on public health. Despite this, screening activities in prisons are still weak in Latin America. We proposed to estimate the prevalence of depression and psychosis and associated factors in the largest Ecuadorian prison for male inmates. Methods Cross-sectional study with 309 prisoners chosen at random between January and February 2017, who were administered two structured questionnaires. The first examined socio-demographic and occupational characteristics prior to incarceration and presence of social support networks; the second was the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview version in Spanish 5.0.0. We used maximum likelihood tests and multiple logistic regression to assess associations between depression, psychosis and study factors. Results The prevalence of depression and psychosis were 50.2% (95% CI 44.6-55.8) and 25.9% (95% CI 21.0-30.8), respectively. The two conditions occurred together in 22.0% of the cases (95% CI 14.8-29.2), and depression or psychosis (D/P) was found in 54.0% (95% CI 48.4-59.6). Consuming drugs while in prison was found in 41.4% (95% CI 35.9-46.9). When age was considered among those consuming drugs, the prevalence of D/P were 72.2, 88.0, and 92.3%, respectively for the age-groups 18-29, 30-39 and 40 years or over (p-value < 0.001). Using a multivariate model, we found that not receiving visits (AOR 3.15 95%CI 1.42-6.96) and consuming drugs while in prison (AOR 5.85 95%CI 3.06-11.16) were associated with D/P, while the age effect disappears. Inmates who stopped drug consumption in prison or who had never consumed did not present any significant differences. Conclusions Depression and psychosis in prisoners are strongly affected by the absence of visitors and by consumption of drugs in prison. Greater presence of social support networks and preventive actions targeting drug abuse would contribute to improving the mental health of prison inmates.

AB Background Depression is a major problem among nurses; hence, it is important to develop a primary prevention strategy to manage depression among nurses. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) study aims to investigate the effects of a newly developed internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) program on depressive symptoms, measured at baseline and three- and six-month follow-ups, among nurses in Japan. Methods Nurses working at three university hospitals, one public hospital, and twelve private hospitals who meet inclusion criteria will be recruited and randomized either to the intervention group or the control group (planned N = 525 for each group). The newly developed iCBT program for nurses consists of six modules, which cover different components of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); transactional stress model (in module 1), self-monitoring skills (in module 2), behavioral activation skills (in module 3), cognitive restructuring skills (in modules 4 and 5), relaxation skills (in module 5), and problem-solving skills (in module 6). Participants in the intervention group will be asked to read these modules within 9 weeks. The primary outcome will be depressive symptoms as assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) at baseline, three-, and six-month follow-ups. Discussion The greatest strength of this study is that it is the first RCT to test the effectiveness of the iCBT program in improving depressive symptoms among nurses. A major limitation is that all measurements, including major depressive episodes, are self-reported and may be affected by situational factors at work and participants' perceptions.

DE Meningitis; Media coverage; Public health; Policy
ID NEWS COVERAGE
AB Background Between 2015 and 2017 six deaths due to meningitis in the Lombardy Region, Northern Italy, caught the attention of media and increased concern among the population, with a consequent increase in demand for vaccination. Considering the evidence about the impact of media coverage of health issues on public behaviour, this paper investigates the trend of media coverage and internet searches regarding meningitis in the Lombardy Region. Methods Content analysis of online articles published from January 2015 to May 2017 and analysis of Google Trends were carried out. A codebook was created in order to assess the content of each article analysed, based on six areas: article characteristics, information about meningococcal disease and vaccination, Local Health Authority activities, accuracy of information and tone of the message. Results Both public interest and media attention peaked in December 2016 and January 2017, when the Lombardy Regional Authority changed its policy by offering co-payment to adults with a saving of 50%. The frequency of meningitis coverage decreased after the announcement of policy change. For example, articles containing new information on meningitis or meningococcal vaccine (76 to 48%, p = 0.01) and preventive recommendations (31% down to 10%, p = 0.006) decreased significantly. An alarmist tone appeared in 21% of pre-policy articles that decreased to 5% post-policy (p = 0.03). Conclusions The findings suggest a role for the media in fostering public pressure towards health services and policy-makers. A collaboration between Public Health institutions and the media would be beneficial in order to improve communication with the public.

DE Public health; Monitoring; Old age; Indicators
ID FRAMEWORK
AB Background The scoping review was conducted as part of the project "Improving Health Monitoring in Old Age" (IMOA) which aims at developing a conceptual framework with key indicators for a public health monitoring of the population aged 65 years and older in Germany. We systematically identified indicator-based monitoring systems that focus on health and wellbeing of older populations in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and analysed them with regard to structure, development and content. Methods A systematic search strategy included searching the websites of national public health institutes, an additional internet search and a MEDLINE search via PubMed. Indicator systems were included if they presented data on a national level, if they were published or updated after 01/01/2007, if they relied on more than one data source and if they were available in English or German. Data on the structure and development of the indicator sets were extracted using a standardized documentation form, and a content analysis of the indicators was conducted using a pre-defined conceptual framework with three health areas and 11 health domains that is based on the Worlds Health Organization's "World Report on Ageing and Health" and on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Results Ten indicator-based monitoring systems met our inclusion criteria. Of these, six systems focused exclusively on older populations, and four offer a specific subset of indicators for older age. The number of indicators varied between 22 and 53 (median 32.5). Four systems were directly related to national public health or healthy ageing strategies, and two systems had been developed in consensus processes involving multiple stakeholders. The highest numbers of indicators could be assigned to the domains "health care", "nursing and community care", "wealth and poverty" and "physical health". Overall, 47 different concepts could be identified in the monitoring systems. Conclusion Among indicator-based monitoring systems of health in older age identified in member countries of the OECD, there is considerable variation with regard to structure, development and content. The results will inspire the development of a public health monitoring of the older population in Germany.

ID BODY-MASS INDEX; OVERWEIGHT; RISK; BIRTH; ADULTS; HEALTH
AB Background Approximately 17% of children in the U.S. are obese. Children that are overweight or obese are also more likely to be obese as adults and suffer from various chronic diseases and premature death. Maternal obesity can affect the weight status of her offspring through intrauterine mechanisms like excessive gestational weight gain (GWG). Current literature shows a positive association between maternal weight status and GWG on child obesity, yet the direct and indirect effects have not been decomposed or quantified. The purpose of this study was to estimate the effect of maternal obesity on child obesity, mediated by GWG, which is a modifiable risk factor. Methods The study participants were a birth cohort of offspring from women who received prenatal care in the Duke/Durham Regional health care system in Durham, NC between 2005 and 2009. Anthropomorphic data was collected via electronic medical records (EMRs) during each voluntary visit to a health care facility. The exposure of interest was maternal obesity, measured by pre-pregnancy body mass index, the mediator was GWG, dichotomized into excessive and not excessive based on maternal prenatal BMI, and the outcome was child obesity at age 4, measured as BMI z-scores from the last recorded height and weight. A counterfactual theory-based product method analysis estimated the mediated effects of GWG, adjusted for maternal race, socioeconomic status, and smoking status. Results Of the 766 children, 25% were overweight or obese, and among all mothers, 25 and 31% were overweight and obese, respectively. Maternal BMI was associated with an overall increase of 0.04 in offspring z-score. The proportion of the effect of maternal obesity on child age 4 obesity mediated by GWG was 8.1%. Conclusion GWG, in part, mediated the relationship between maternal BMI and childhood adiposity. Even when the mediator is fixed, children are at an increased risk of a higher BMI if the mother is obese. These findings highlight an important public health education opportunity to stress the impact of a pre-pregnancy weight and excessive GWG on the risk of child obesity for all mothers.

AB Background Incentives are central to economics and are used across the public and private sectors to influence behavior. Recent interest has been shown in using financial incentives to promote desirable health behaviors and discourage unhealthy ones. Main text If we are going to use incentive schemes to influence health behaviors, then it is important that we give them the best chance of working. Behavioral economics integrates insights from psychology with the laws of economics and provides a number of robust psychological phenomena that help to better explain human behavior. Individuals' decisions in relation to incentives may be shaped by more subtle features - such as loss aversion, overweighting of small probabilities, hyperbolic discounting, increasing payoffs, reference points - many of which have been identified through research in behavioral economics. If incentives are shown to be a useful strategy to influence health behavior, a wider discussion will need to be had about the ethical dimensions of incentives before their wider implementation in different health programmes. Conclusions Policy makers across the world are increasingly taking note of lessons from behavioral economics and this paper explores how key principles could help public health practitioners design effective interventions both in relation to incentive designs and more widely.

AB Background Screening for medical conditions (MCs) of public health importance is a first step in disease prevention and control. Prior studies in the United States found oral health care providers (OHCPS) embrace screening for increased risk of medical conditions in the dental setting. Our objectives were to assess Saudi Arabian (SA) dentist's attitudes, willingness and perceived barriers towards implementing screening for MCs into their dental practices. Methods A self-administered, 5-point Likert Scale (1 = very important/willing to 5 = very unimportant/unwilling) questionnaire was given to a convenience sample of 190 practicing dentists. Friedman nonparametric analysis of variance was used to compare responses within each question. Results Of the 143 responding dentists the mean age was 31 years; 102 (71%) were men. The majority felt it was important for a dentist to screen for cardiovascular disease (98.6%), hypertension (97.9%), diabetes (97.9%), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (97.9%), and hepatitis C virus (98.6%). Respondents were willing to refer a patient to a physician (97.9%); send samples to an outside laboratory (96.1%); conduct screening that yields immediate results (96.2%); and discuss results immediately with the patient (93.7%). Respondents were willing to measure/collect blood pressure (67.2%); weight and height (63.7%); and finger stick blood (54.6%). The whole responding dentists (100%) reported time as an important barrier. Respondents were significantly more willing to refer a patient for consultation than send samples to an outside laboratory (mean ranks: 2.32, 2.81, P < 0.001); significantly more willing to measure blood pressure than take oral fluids for salivary diagnostics (mean ranks 2.22, 2.75, p = 0.003). Insurance was significantly (P < 0.05) less important barrier than time, cost, patients' willingness or liability (mean ranks 3.56, 2.63, 3.00, 2.79, 3.02, respectively). Conclusions The majority of dentists in this study reported positive attitudes towards and willingness to perform medical screenings in their practice. Time was an important factor.

AB Background Plasma-free amino acid profiles have been reported to correlate with obesity and glucose metabolism, and have been studied as potentially useful biomarkers of lifestyle-related diseases affecting metabolism in adulthood. However, knowledge of these relationships is lacking in children, despite the growing public health problem posed by childhood obesity. The aim of this study was to assess whether plasma-free amino acid profiles can serve as useful biomarkers of lifestyle-related diseases in children with obesity. Methods This retrospective study used the medical records of 26 patients (15 male, 11 female) aged 9 or 10 years presenting with moderate to severe obesity and hyperlipidemia between April 2015 and March 2017. A degree of obesity of 30% or more was defined as moderate or severe. Amino acid levels were compared between obese children with and without impaired glucose tolerance using a t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. In addition, the influence of factors such as intima media thickness, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, amino acids, and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were analyzed pairwise using Pearson's correlation or Spearman's rank correlation. Results HOMA-IR was positively correlated with valine, leucine (Leu), isoleucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, methionine, threonine, lysine, alanine, tyrosine, glutamate (Glu), proline, arginine, ornithine, total free amino acids (all P < 0.01), and aspartate (P = 0.010). Moreover, blood uric acid levels were positively correlated with Leu (P = 0.005) and Glu (P = 0.019), and negatively correlated with serine, glycine, and asparagine (P = 0.007, P = 0.003, and P = 0.013, respectively). Conclusions Amino acid profile reflects impaired glucose tolerance and hyperuricemia at an early stage of obesity. It is therefore a useful marker to inform early intervention in children with obesity, as in adults.

AB Background Childhood overweight/obesity has become a major public health concern globally because of its adverse health consequences and escalating prevalence. The factors underlying the disease conditions manifested during adulthood commonly originate in childhood. Nepal is going through a transition where under-nutrition co-exists with obesity; however, there is a lack of well-documented information on childhood overweight or obesity in Nepal. This study was carried out to determine the prevalence and associated factors of childhood overweight/obesity among urban primary school children. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted from May to October of 2017. Behavioral data were collected using a structured self-administered questionnaire with parents of children aged 6-13 years old in grades 1-5 studying in private schools of Lalitpur district in Nepal. Study participants were selected using two-stage cluster random sampling from 10 private schools. Height and weight measurements of 575 children were taken and BMI-for-age-sex was calculated using WHO AnthroPlus. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21. Associated factors were examined using Chi-square tests followed by multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results The study found that out of 575 students, 107 (18.6%) were overweight and 41 (7.1%) were obese. Among 328 male children, 62 (19.0%) were overweight and 35 (10.6%) were obese. Likewise, among 247 female children, 45 (18.2%) were overweight and 6 (2.4%) were obese. Male children (aOR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.38-3.53), children of mothers with a high school (aOR = 3.13, 95% CI: 1.39-7.12) or university level of education (aOR = 3.09, 95% CI: 1.23-7.70) and children of mothers in a professional field (aOR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.02-4.05) had a greater likelihood of being overweight/obese. Likewise, students consuming energy-dense less nutrient food (aOR = 2.92, 95% CI: 1.66-5.12), lacking active travel to and from school (aOR = 2.38, 95% CI: 1.12-4.79) and those having sedentary behaviors (aOR = 3.01, 95% CI: 1.20-7.29) were likely to be overweight/obese. Conclusions More than one-quarter of the children in urban Lalitpur were found to be overweight/obese. High junk food consumption and sedentary activity were found to be significantly associated with childhood overweight/obesity. School health and awareness programs aiming to reduce the intake of energy-dense foods and promote an active lifestyle including active transportation to school among children are imperative. Future studies to objectively measure the type and amount of food intake and physical activity of students are recommended.

TI Understanding the unintended consequences of public health policies: the
   views of policymakers and evaluators
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID INEQUALITIES; DELIBERATION
AB Background Public health policies sometimes have unexpected effects. Understanding how policies and interventions lead to outcomes is essential if policymakers and researchers are to intervene effectively and reduce harmful and other unintended consequences (UCs) of their actions. Yet, evaluating complex mechanisms and outcomes is challenging, even before considering how to predict assess and understand outcomes and UCs when interventions are scaled up. We aimed to explore with UK policymakers why some policies have UCs, and how researchers and policymakers should respond. Methods We convened a one-day workshop with 14 people involved in developing, implementing or evaluating social and public health policies, and/or evaluating possible unintended effects. This included senior evaluators, policymakers from government and associated agencies, and researchers, covering policy domains from public health, social policy, poverty, and international development. Results Policymakers suggested UCs happen for a range of reasons: poor policy design, unclear articulation of policy mechanisms or goals, or unclear or inappropriate evidence use, including evaluation techniques. While not always avoidable, it was felt that UCs could be partially mitigated by better use of theory and evidence, better involvement of stakeholders in concurrent design and evaluation of policies, and appropriate evaluation systems. Conclusions UCs can be used to explore the mechanisms underpinning social change caused by public health policies. Articulating these mechanisms is essential for truly evidence-informed decision-making, to enable informed debate about policy options, and to develop evaluation techniques. Future work includes trying to develop a holistic stakeholder-led evaluation process.

ID BODY-IMAGE CONCERNS; SELF-ESTEEM
AB Background Eating disorders among adolescents are an ongoing public health concern. Sustainable health promotion programmes require a thorough understanding of the social context in which minors engage. Initial studies show that young people make extensive use of social networks in order to exchange experiences and gather information. During this process their (buying) behaviour is significantly affected by so-called influencers. Methods The exploratory research studies non-campaign driven health communication on dieting and exercise by influencers in social networks with a focus on content, techniques and visible impact. In a mixed methods approach, we initially analysed 1000 posts from influencers on Instagram quantitatively. Subsequently we conducted an in-depth content analysis of 9 extreme and 27 typical communication threads. Results Influencers gain the trust and friendship of their followers by designing body-shape focused visual content and targeted communication techniques. They identify and define diet and exercise as factors to be controlled for body perfection. By consuming dietary supplements and wearing tight-fitting branded sportswear, influencers promise a simplified way of optimizing one's appearance as the key to happiness. Direct and surreptitious advertising of industry-specific products constitutes the communicative focus. At the same time, minors identify with the roles and ideals demonstrated by influencers and their needs are satisfied on several different levels. This creates a relationship of dependency between influencers and their followers. Conclusions The dynamics in the field of health communication by influencers on social networks will become increasingly important in the coming years. This is largely due to the targeted demand on the part of (mainly) underage users and the high attractiveness of influencer marketing on the part of companies. Influencers suggest a dependence on happiness, well-being, health and beauty. Only those who create a body shaped through control and discipline are healthy and beautiful - and can be happy. The indirectly communicated conclusions, which can be considered as extremely critical, illustrate the need for action in order to protect and positively accompany young people in their psychological and physical development. The shift of authority figures within Generation Z, as well as identified communication techniques, can be considered and may be harnessed by targeted, group-oriented campaign designs.

ID HEALTH; PREVALENCE; GROWTH
AB Background Domestic violence and abuse (DVA) is a serious public health issue, threatening the health of individuals the world over. Whilst DVA can be experienced by both men and women, the majority is still experienced by women; around 30% of women worldwide who have been in a relationship report that they have experienced violence at the hands of their partner, and every week in England and Wales two women are killed by their current or ex-partner. The purpose of this study was to explore the concept of thrivership with women who have experienced DVA, to contribute to our understandings of what constitutes 'thriving' post-abuse, and how women affected can move from surviving to thriving. Methods Thirty-seven women took part in this qualitative study which consisted of six focus groups and four in-depth interviews undertaken in one region of the UK in 2018. Data were analysed using a thematic analysis approach. Initial findings were reported back to a group of participants to invite respondent validation and ensure co-production of data. Results The process of 'thrivership' - moving from surviving to thriving after DVA - is a fluid, non-linear journey of self-discovery featuring three 'stages' of victim, survivor, and thriver. Thriving after DVA is characterised by a positive outlook and looking to the future, improved health and well-being, a reclamation of the self, and a new social network. Crucial to ensuring 'thrivership' are three key components that we propose as the 'Thrivership Model', all of which are underpinned by education and awareness building at different levels: (1) Provision of Safety, (2) Sharing the Story, (3) Social Response. Conclusions The study findings provide a new view of thriving post-abuse by women who have lived through it. The proposed Thrivership Model has been developed to illustrate what is required from DVA-services and public health practitioners for the thrivership process to take place, so that more women may be supported towards 'thriving' after abuse.

TI Regulatory and policy tools to address unproven stem cell interventions
   in Canada: the need for action
SO BMC MEDICAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Stem cell therapies; Unproven therapies; Policy; Law; Regulation
ID THERAPIES
AB Background The marketing of unproven direct-to-consumer stem cell interventions is becoming widespread in Canada. There is little evidence supporting their use and they have been associated with a range of harms. Canada has been slower to act against clinics offering these interventions than other jurisdictions, including the United States. Here, we outline the regulatory and policy tools available in Canada to address this growing problem. Main body Health Canada's regulations governing cell therapies are complex, but recent statements make it clear that Health Canada believes it has jurisdiction over many of the currently marketed stem cell interventions. Still, further regulatory clarity is needed from Health Canada, as are increased directed enforcement efforts on interventions that fall within their scope. The Competition Bureau, via the Competition Act, prohibits advertisers from making materially false or misleading promotional representations. The Competition Bureau could collaborate with the scientific community to analyze the claims of existing clinics in Canada, and impose sanctions upon those who breach the established standard. Professional regulators, including provincial colleges of physicians and surgeons, have considerable power over what products and services their members can offer. Every college of physicians in Canada requires, via policy and codes of ethics, that doctors maintain evidence-based practices. This requirement is incompatible with offering many unproven stem cell interventions. Litigation may be another tool, including the use of fraud, misrepresentation and/or negligence claims for failing to meet the required standard of care. Finally, political pressure on federal and provincial lawmakers could encourage changes to marketing, cell therapy and professional regulations that would allow a more comprehensive response. Conclusions In sum, there are many existing tools that can be used to protect the public from unproven stem cell interventions. Increased bureaucratic will and grassroots efforts are needed in order to effect a positive policy response.

ID ASYMPTOMATIC MICROHEMATURIA; URINALYSIS; ADULTS; RISK
AB Background Microscopic hematuria is a common incidental finding on routine urinalysis. Although there are no clear recommendations to perform routine urinalysis, some studies have shown that up to 50% of general practitioners continue to perform annual routine urinalysis regardless of age or risk factors. The aim of this study was to identify associated factors and prevalence of dipstick microscopic hematuria in the general male population presenting to an annual public men's health fair. Method We conducted a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data at an annual Men's Health fair from 2008 to 2013. Patient reported health questionnaires, basic physical exam including digital rectal exam, basic bloodwork and dipstick urinalysis data was examined. Results A total of 979 patients were reviewed. Of these, 850 provided a urine sample and were included in the final analysis. Seventy-three (8.6%) patients had positive hematuria on urinalysis. Average age in both groups was 55 years. Presence of microscopic hematuria was correlated with presence of diabetes and proteinuria with odds-ratio of 2.8 (1.3-5.8) and 2.9 (1.7-5.0) respectively on multivariate analysis. There was no significant correlation identified with age, hypertension, coronary artery disease, body-mass index, smoking, prostate specific antigen (PSA) or International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Limitation of this study is the lack of follow-up and knowledge of subsequent investigations of patients. Conclusion Microscopic hematuria is a prevalent condition in the male population presenting to a health fair. The only factors associated with microscopic hematuria were diabetes and proteinuria. No association was found between hematuria and smoking, age, or lower urinary tract symptoms.

TI Knowledge, attitude and practice towards malaria among symptomatic
   patients attending Tumbi Referral Hospital: A cross-sectional study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID COMMUNITY KNOWLEDGE
AB Background
   Despite significant improvement in prevention and control over the past decades malaria remains a significant public health concern in Tanzania with 93% of the population being at risk. To prevent malaria infection and promote malaria free zones, understanding the community's knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward malaria control are essential. This study therefore aimed at determining the levels of understanding, and attitudes, as well as socio-cultural aspects of malaria prevention and treatment-seeking behaviours among suspected malaria patients.
   Methods
   This study was a hospital based cross-sectional study, in which patients attending Tumbi Referral Hospital with symptoms and signs that warrant inclusion of suspicion of malaria, were recruited. We used a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire to collect participants' demographic characteristics, as well as information on their knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards malaria infection. Data were analysed using Stata Version 12.1.
   Results
   We enrolled a total of 295 respondents of which 179 (60.68%) were females. Participants' ages ranged from 1-91 years, with a mean of 31.4 years. Seventy-nine (26.8%) patients reported having malaria in the previous 28 days, with 57 (72.2%) being laboratory confirmed. Only 52 (65.8%) individuals reported taking prescribed medications for malaria. A total of 277 (93.90%) were aware of malaria, and 264 (95.31%) knew that it is transmitted by mosquito. Nearly all participants (263, 94.95%), identified sleeping under bed nets to be protective against malaria. About half of the respondents either agreed 63 (22.74%) or strongly agreed 62 (22.38%) that malaria can be transmitted like the common cold. Self-reported mosquito net use was 88.09% (244).
   Conclusion
   Despite the endemicity of malaria in our study site, patients had adequate knowledge, encouraging attitudes, and good practices related to malaria prevention and control.

TI A proposal of a new evaluation framework towards implementation of
   genetic tests
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH TECHNOLOGY-ASSESSMENT; CLINICAL UTILITY; PERSONAL UTILITY;
   PROGRAMS; WOMEN
AB Background
   The existing frameworks for the evaluation of genetic and genomic applications clearly address the technical and clinical value of a test, but are less concerned with the way genetic services are delivered and organized. We therefore aimed to develop a comprehensive new framework that includes an assessment of service delivery.
   Methods
   A new framework was built on the evaluation dimensions identified through a systematic review of the existing frameworks and a Delphi survey of Italian experts in public health genomics.
   Results
   Our framework has four sections. The first two sections, respectively, guide the evidence collection process for the genetic test (analytic validity; clinical validity; clinical utility; personal utility) and its delivery models (organizational aspects; economic evaluation; ethical, legal and social implications; patient perspective). The third section guides the formulation of the research priorities to be addressed in future research. Finally, the fourth section suggests three criteria to summarize the collected evidence (net benefit, cost-effectiveness, feasibility).
   Conclusion
   We have successfully developed an evaluation framework for the evaluation of genetic tests that includes an assessment of service delivery. It also introduces some neglected evaluation dimensions such as personal utility and patient perspective.

AB Background Human papillomavirus is recognized as a major cause of cervical cancer. It is estimated that annually, 7,095 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 4,732 die from the disease in Ethiopia. Understanding that the screening practice is very poor and the coverage is very limited, this disease burden is one of the major public health agendas in Ethiopia. This study aimed to assess the burden and genotype distribution of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR HPV) infection and cervical cytology abnormalities at selected obstetrics and gynecology clinics of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods An institutional-based cross-sectional study design was employed from June to October 2015. Cervical samples were collected from 366 participants based on inclusion criteria. HR HPV DNA was analyzed using an Abbott Real-Time PCR system, and cervical cytology screening was performed using the conventional Pap-smear technique. Data were entered in to Epi-data version 13 and analyzed using STATA version 11. Results The overall HR HPV burden and abnormal cytology were 13.7 and 13.1%, respectively. The majority of HR HPV types were other than types 16 and 18. Of the total abnormal cytology results, 81.3% were low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs), and 12.5 and 6.3% were atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs), respectively. Residence, occupation, and HIV serostatus were significantly associated with HR HPV infection. Among the variables, age, age at first marriage, and education were the only ones associated with cervical cytology abnormalities. The overall agreement between the real-time PCR and Pap cytology screening methods was 78.96% (Kappa value of 0.12, 95% CI (0.00-0.243), P = 0.01). Conclusions Non-16/18 HR HPV genotypes represented the largest proportion of HR HPV infections in this study. Women without cervical cytology abnormalities had the highest frequency of HR HPV infection. A large-scale community-based cohort study shall be designed and implemented to further identifying the persistent genotype and assessing the changes in cervical epithelial cell lines.

ID INTRAFAMILIAL TRANSMISSION; VIRUS-INFECTION; PREVALENCE
AB Background The epidemiology and risk factors for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Rwanda are not well known; however, this information is crucial to shaping the country's public health approach to hepatitis C control. Methods A HCV screening campaign was conducted in the general population in 24 districts previously identified to have a high HCV disease burden. At the time of sample collection, sociodemographic information and self-reported risk factors were collected. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were conducted to assess risk factors independently associated with hepatitis C antibodies (HCVAb) seroprevalence. Results Out of a total of 326,263 individuals screened for HCVAb, 22,183 (6.8%) were positive. In multivariate analysis, risk factors identified as statistically associated with HCVAb Seroprevalence include history of traditional operation or scarification (OR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.05-1.14), presence of viral hepatitis in the family (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.15-1.40), widowed or separated/divorced (OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.26-1.47), Southern province (OR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.88-2.08) and aged 65 years and older (OR = 4.86, 95% CI: 4.62-5.11). Ubudehe category 3 (OR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.93-1.01) and participants using RAMA (Health insurances for employees of public and private sectors) insurance (OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.70-0.85) had lower odds of HCV seroprevalence. Conclusions Our findings provide important information for Rwanda's strategy on prevention and case-finding. Future prevention interventions should aim to reduce transmission through targeted messaging around traditional healing practices and case-finding targeting individuals with a history of exposure or advanced age.

AB Background Chronic Kidney Disease in certain part of Sri Lanka and increasing burden of CKD in some other countries is a global public health problem. While the underlying causes of majority of cases are unknown, effective control and prevention strategies are yet to be taken. Though the disease has been identify more than decade ago, baseline data on renal function are not available. This study reports the age and sex disaggregated data of renal functions among screening participants of the Anuradhapura, the district with the highest disease burden in Sri Lanka. Methods The screening prorgramme was done as a part of CKD control programme of Anuradhapura. All screening centers were visited and information and urine sample collection tubes were distributed before the screening date. A serum and urine sample was taken from all participants. In a subsample, urine sulfosalicylic acid test (SSA Test), urine dipstick test, urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) and urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) was done. Results The study sample included 7768 apparently healthy people aging 18 to 93 years and females (n = 5522) accounted for 71.1% of the sample. Mean age of the participants was 45.9 (SD 14.1) years. Mean eGFR in this population was 90.8 mL/min/1.73m(2)(SD 24.6) with a significantly lower eGFR (88.1 mL/min/1.73m(2)) among males compared to female (92.8 mL/min/1.73m(2)). Mean eGFR was 115 mL/min/1.73m(2) (SE .5) among participants aging less than 30 and this value drastically reduced to 59.1 mL/min/1.73m(2) (SE 1.2) among people aging more than 70 years. Proportion of people having reduction of eGFR compatible with mild, moderate, severe and kidney failure categories was 33.9(32.7-34.8), 8.4(7.8-9.0), 1.5(1.2-1.7) and 0.7(0.5-0.9). The age and sex adjusted prevalence of eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in a single sample in this population was 10.6%. Bayesian Latent Class model analysis shows that UPCR> 150 has the highest sensitivity to detect those who are with eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. UACR, the usual recommended test as a screening test was having a sensitivity of 35.3% in this population. Conclusion UPCR and UACR should be use as a screening tests in areas with high proportion of CKDu patients. More research are required to investigate the use of age and sex specific cut off values to diagnose CKD.

AB Background Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a growing public health problem. Many risk factors were identified and interventions were applied accordingly, but the incidence of end-stage renal disease continued increasing. Some other risk factors may be ignored. Gut microbiota has been recognized as an important endogenous organ. The kidney-gut axis would contribute to gut dysbiosis, which might worsen CKD. Constipation, commonly seen in CKD, was one of the clinical presentation of gut dysbiosis. The clinical impact of constipation to CKD remains unknown. Our study aimed at assessing the risk of ESRD between CKD patients with and without constipation in a nationwide database. Methods We identified newly diagnosed cases of CKD without constipation history before in 2000-2011 from the Taiwan National Health Insurance database. Subjects who developed constipation later formed constipation group. The others without constipation matched by propensity score formed non-constipation group. The incidence rates and hazards of ESRD in patients with and without constipation by the end of 2013 were compared by using Cox proportional hazard models with a time-dependent variable. Results The incidences of ESRD per 1000 person-years were 22.9 for constipation group and 12.2 for non-constipation group, respectively. Cox proportional hazard models with a time-dependent variable revealed an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.90 (95% CI, 1.60-2.27). Compared to the CKD patients without constipation, adjusted hazard ratio for the CKD patients with laxatives < 33, 33-197 and >= 198 days per year were 0.45 (0.31-0.63), 1.85 (1.47-2.31) and 4.41 (3.61-5.39) respectively. Conclusion In a population of newly-diagnosed CKD patients, we observed that subjects with de novo constipation, as compared with non-constipation, have increased risk of developing ESRD. More severe constipation would increase the risk further.

   AFRICA; UPDATE
AB Background Stroke is the second-leading global cause of death behind heart disease in 2013 and is a major cause of permanent disability. The burden of stroke in terms of mortality, morbidity and disability is increasing across the world. It is currently observed to be one of the commonest reasons of admission in many health care setups and becoming an alarming serious public health problem in our country Ethiopia. Despite the high burden of strokes globally, there is insufficient information on the current clinical profile of stroke in low and middle income countries (LMICs) including Ethiopia. So, this study was aimed to assess risk factors, clinical presentations and predictors of stroke subtypes among adult patients admitted to stroke unit of Jimma university medical center (JUMC). Methods Prospective observational study design was carried out at stroke unit (SU) of JUMC for 4 consecutive months from March 10-July 10, 2017. A standardized data extraction checklist and patient interview was used to collect data. Data was entered into Epi data version 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of stroke subtypes. Result A total of 116 eligible stroke patients were recruited during the study period. The mean age of the patients was 55.1 +/- 14.0 years and males comprised 62.9%. According to world health organization (WHO) criteria of stroke diagnosis, 51.7% of patients had ischemic while 48.3% had hemorrhagic stroke. The most common risk factor identified was hypertension (75.9%) followed by family history (33.6%), alcohol intake (22.4%), smoking (17.2%) and heart failure (17.2%). The most common clinical presentation was headache complained by 75.0% of the patients followed by aphasia 60.3% and hemiparesis 53.4%. Atrial fibrillation was the independent predictor of hemorrhagic stroke (AOR: 0.08, 95% CI: 0.01-0.68). Conclusion The clinical characteristics of stroke in this set up were similar to other low- and middle-resource countries. As stroke is a high priority chronic disease, large-scale public health campaign should be launched focusing on public education regarding stroke risk factors and necessary interventions.

AB Background The article by Marryat, Thompson and Wilson (2017) in BMC Pediatrics presents an evaluation of the implementation of the Triple P system as a public health intervention conducted by the Glasgow City Council and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. Discussion Unfortunately, the conclusions drawn are questionable for multiple reasons. The lack of a controlled design precludes defensible conclusions about intervention effects free from routine threats to internal validity. There was a substantial mismatch between the intervention sample and the population sample assessed. The article's title and abstract leave readers with the mistaken impression that the children assessed for outcome were suitably representative of intervention families, when in fact many of the children in the intervention families were missing from the teacher-report outcome assessment (a single questionnaire), and many or most of the children in the teacher-report outcome assessment belonged to families who had never received the intervention. Although Triple P targets parent-child relations and child behavioural and emotional problems at home, Marryat et al. narrowly defined mental health impact as child difficulties in nursery or preschool, while not reporting data from practitioners and parents in the same evaluation that did not support the authors' conclusion. The paper was further diminished by a number of misleading statements and factual errors related for example to other research on Triple P. Studying the extent to which child mental health functioning at home can generalise to school settings is an important topic of inquiry in relation to parenting support interventions, but unfortunately the Marryat et al. article did not move this area forward.

AB Pregnant women are highly susceptible to anaemia and iron deficiency due to the increased demands of pregnancy as well as other factors. Iron supplementation is recommended in pregnancy, yet the benefits on newborn outcomes are variable between populations, most likely due to the heterogeneity in the prevalence of iron deficiency, detrimental birth outcomes and infectious diseases. Furthermore, there are concerns regarding iron supplementation in malaria-endemic areas due to reports of increased risk of malaria in those receiving iron. This is compounded by limited knowledge of how iron deficiency, anaemia, malaria, and other infections may interact to influence birth outcomes. In a recent cohort study in Papua New Guinea, where there is a high burden of infections and iron deficiency, we found that iron deficiency in pregnancy was associated with a reduced risk of adverse birth outcomes. However, this effect could not be wholly explained by interactions between iron deficiency and malaria. We proposed that iron deficiency may confer a degree of protection against other infectious pathogens, which in turn caused improvements in birthweight. We argue that further studies in multiple populations are crucial to elucidate interactions between iron status, iron supplementation and birthweight as well as to understand the context-specific benefits of iron supplementation in pregnancy and inform public policy. Focus should be given to haematological studies on anaemia, haemodilution and iron absorption, as well as investigating infectious diseases and other nutritional deficiencies. This is a particular priority in resource-constrained settings where the prevalence of iron deficiency, poor nutrition, infections and poor birth outcomes are high. While current recommendations of iron supplementation and malaria prophylaxis to reduce the burden of poor pregnancy outcomes should be supported, the strength of evidence underpinning these must be improved and new insights should be garnered in order to maximise improvements in maternal and child health.

AB Background As public health becomes increasingly central to the practice of medicine, educational efforts are necessary to prepare medical students to apply public health concepts in their care of patients. There are few accessible and informative tools to prepare students to engage with population health challenges. Methods We distributed an online questionnaire to clinical students, querying gaps in their education on public health topics. Based upon the responses, we developed a web-based curriculum for medical students rotating at a public safety-net hospital on pediatrics, medicine, primary care, psychiatry, and surgery services from April-December 2017 (available at ). Students received guiding questions and media-based resources (e.g. podcasts, TedTalks, YouTube videos) in weekly modules addressing topics in public health. Each module incorporated 30 min of mobile-optimized content, including specific data relating the topic to the Central Harlem community. Familiarity with public health was assessed with pre- and post-program quizzes, including 10 multiple-choice and 2 open-ended questions. Results Among the 70 participating students, 59 (84%) completed both the pre- and post-assessments. The five-week curriculum covered health systems, social determinants, race, substance use, violence, and alternative care models. After completing the five-week curriculum, the mean correct score on a multiple-choice quiz rose from 57 to 66% (p = 0.001). In the qualitative section of the test, students were asked what public health topics should be taught in medical school. Frequently suggested topics included social determinants of health (25%), epidemiology (25%), health systems (25%), insurance (21%), policy (17%), economics (17%), racism (15%), and health disparities (8%). When asked how public health will impact their medical career, students frequently responded that it would greatly impact their clinical practice (49%), choice of residency program (17%), and decision to pursue advocacy or additional degrees (15%). Conclusions Learners participating in this five-week online public health curriculum demonstrated a significant increase in public health knowledge. The online format allowed for high participation across five different specialty rotations, and community-specific data allowed students to recognize the importance of public health in medical practice.

AB Background Adolescents engage in various combinations (typologies) of physical activity and sedentary behaviors, which impact their health and wellbeing in different ways. As such, there is a need to understand the factors that may inhibit or facilitate engagement in combinations of activity-related behaviors to help inform effective intervention strategies targeting those most in need. The aim of this study was to identify ecological correlates of adolescent physical activity and sedentary behavior typologies. Methods Cross-sectional study of 473 adolescents (15.0 +/- 1.6 years, 41.4% boys) from 18 secondary schools in Melbourne, Australia. Intrapersonal, interpersonal and neighborhood-physical environmental factors were assessed via self-report surveys and Geographic Information Systems. Multinomial logistic regression models determined the relative risk ratio of membership of three homogenous activity-related behavior typologies based on the potential correlates. Results Higher levels of self-efficacy for physical activity, parental screen-time restriction rules, parental support for physical activity, sibling screen-time co-participation and perceptions of neighborhood pedestrian/traffic safety were associated with greater likelihood of adolescents being in the typology defined as highly active and low sedentary compared to the physically inactive, highly sedentary typology. Higher frequency of co-participation in screen-time with friends was associated with greater likelihood of adolescents being in the typology defined as moderately active, high screen-time compared to physically inactive, highly sedentary. Conclusions A range of intrapersonal, interpersonal and environmental correlates appear to play a role in adolescent activity-related typology membership. The findings may inform public health interventions targeting unique adolescent subgroups most at risk of poor health outcomes based on their engagement in combinations of activity-related behaviors.

TI Factors influencing willingness and ability to pay for social health

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID TO-PAY; EXPENDITURE; GHANA
AB Background
   Many low and middle-income countries are increasingly cognisant of the need to offer financial protection to its citizens through pre-payment schemes in order to curb high out of pocket expenditure and catastrophic spending on healthcare. However, there is limited rigorous contextual evidence to make decisions regarding optimal design of such schemes. This study assesses the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for the recently introduced state contributory health insurance scheme (SHIS) in Nigeria.
   Methods
   The study took place in 6 local government areas in Kaduna state, North-west Nigeria. Data were collected from a household survey using a three-stage cluster sampling approach, with each household having the same probability of being selected. Interviews were conducted with 4000 individuals in 1020 households. Contingent valuation was used to elicit the willing to pay (WTP) for the household using the bidding game technique. The relationship between socioeconomic status and WTP was also examined using logistic regression models.
   Findings
   About 82% of the household heads were willing to pay insurance premiums for their households, which came to an average of 513 Naira (1.68 USD) per month per person. The average amount individuals were willing to pay was lower in rural areas (611 Naira) compared to urban areas (463 Naira). These results were influenced by household size, level of education, occupation and household income. In addition, only 65% of the households had the ability to pay the average premium.
   Conclusion
   Socioeconomic factors influence individuals' WTP for contributory health insurance schemes. It is important to create awareness about the benefits of the insurance scheme, especially in rural areas, and in both the formal and informal sectors in Nigeria. WTP information can inform the amount of insurance premiums. However, it is important to consider differences between the WTP and the cost of benefits package to be offered, as the premium amount may need to be subsidized with public financing.

AB Aim
   To investigate cycling participation and barriers, and facilitators in adults with a lower limb amputation in Thailand.
   Method
   Questionnaires were given to 424 adults with uni/bilateral lower limb amputation from mid-foot to hip disarticulation level at five public hospitals in Bangkok and prosthetic mobile units in Thailand. Participant characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics. Variables associated with cycling (p<0.1) were entered in a logistic regression model.
   Results
   Participants who cycled (46.7%, N = 197), mostly used their walking prostheses (91.9%, n = 188). Of cyclists, 92.4% had cycled before the amputation. Cyclists started cycling after the amputation by themselves (86.7%) mostly in order to increase/maintain health (67.0%). Most cyclists cycled on quiet roads. The most frequent destination was shops/market (64.1%). More facilitators were reported than barriers. Most reported barriers were related to health problems and negative attitudes toward cycling. Most reported facilitators were related to perceived health benefits and positive attitude toward cycling. The likelihood of cycling after the amputation increased in people who cycled before the amputation, were amputated lower than the knee, used a prosthetic foot with axis/axes, were amputated due to trauma, had income higher than 415 euro/month, and who reported a higher numbers of facilitators.
   Conclusion
   After a lower limb amputation, nearly half of people cycled. People with a below knee amputation due to trauma with prior cycling experience and higher income tended to cycle after the amputation. People who perceived more facilitators were more likely to cycle. Although cyclists could use a walking prosthesis to cycle, a prosthetic foot with a greater range of motion than the SACH increased the cycling likelihood.

TI Failures in the case management of children with uncomplicated malaria
   in Bata district of Equatorial Guinea and associated factors
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID RESISTANCE; ARTEMISININ; ARTEMETHER
AB Background
   In Equatorial Guinea, malaria continues to be one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality among children. The National Therapeutic Guide established artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) as first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria, but compliance with this treatment is low. The aim of this study was to assess, for the first time, the performance of public healthcare workers in the diagnosis and treatment of uncomplicated malaria, their compliance with first-line Malaria National Therapeutic Guide and the associated factors.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional survey was conducted at the nine public health facilities in the Bata District of Equatorial Guinea to assess the management of uncomplicated malaria in children < 15 years of age. Bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses were used to determine the recommended treatment compliance and related factors.
   Results
   A total of 227 children with uncomplicated malaria were recorded from 9 public health facilities. Most of the treatments prescribed (83.3%) did not follow the first-line treatment recommended for uncomplicated malaria. The diagnosis was established with parasite confirmation in 182 cases (80.2%). After adjustment for other variables, children under 2 months of age, the use of parasite confirmation to the diagnosis of malaria and being familiar with the national therapeutic guide were significantly associated with the prescription of the first-line recommended treatment. Cases attended at the hospital or in a health facility with ASAQ in the pharmacy at the time of the study were also more likely to be prescribed with the recommended treatment, but with non-significant association after adjustment for other variables.
   Conclusions
   This study identified the factors associated with the low compliance with the first-line treatment by the public healthcare facilities of Bata District of Equatorial Guinea. It seems necessary to improve case management of children with uncomplicated malaria; to reinforce the use of Malaria National Therapeutic Guide and to inform about the danger of using artemisinin monotherapy. Furthermore, it is crucial to provide recommended first-line treatment to the pharmacies of all public health facilities to ensure access to this treatment.

AB Background To determine the optimal cut-off values and evaluate the associations of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and waist-height ratio (WHtR) with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Methods A large-scale cross-sectional survey was conducted among 35,256 adults aged 20-74 years in Shanghai between June 2016 and December 2017. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were conducted to assess the optimal cut-off anthropometric indices of CVD risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia and hyperuricemia. Multivariate Logistic regression models were preformed to evaluate the odds ratio of CVD risk factors. Results The area under the curve (AUC) of WHtR was significantly greater than that of BMI or WC in the prediction of hypertension and diabetes, and AUCs were higher in women than men. The optimal cut-off values of WHtR were approximately 0.51 in both sexes, while the cut-off values of BMI and WC were higher for men compared with women. The optimal cutoff values of BMI and WC varied greatly across different age groups, but the difference in WHtR was relatively slight. Among women, the optimal threshold of anthropometric indices appeared to increase with age for hypertension and diabetes. The odds ratio between anthropometric indices and CVD risk factors were attenuated with age. WHtR had the greatest odds ratio for CVD risk factors among adults under 60 years old except for women with hypertension, while among 60-74 years, BMI yielded the greatest odds ratio in terms of all CVD outcomes except for women with diabetes. Conclusions WHtR had the best performance for discriminating hypertension and diabetes and potentially be served as a standard screening tool in public health. The associations between three anthropometric indices and CVD risk factors differed by sex and decreased with age. These findings indicated a need to develop age- and gender-specific difference and make effective strategies for primary prevention of CVDs.

AB A major challenge of eco-epidemiology is to determine which factors promote the transmission of infectious diseases and to establish risk maps that can be used by public health authorities. The geographic predictions resulting from ecological niche modelling have been widely used for modelling the future dispersion of vectors based on the occurrence records and the potential prevalence of the disease. The establishment of risk maps for disease systems with complex cycles such as cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) can be very challenging due to the many inference networks between large sets of host and vector species, with considerable heterogeneity in disease patterns in space and time. One novelty in the present study is the use of human CL cases to predict the risk of leishmaniasis occurrence in response to anthropogenic, climatic and environmental factors at two different scales, in the Neotropical moist forest biome (Amazonian basin and surrounding forest ecosystems) and in the surrounding region of French Guiana. With a consistent data set never used before and a conceptual and methodological framework for interpreting data cases, we obtained risk maps with high statistical support. The predominantly identified human CL risk areas are those where the human impact on the environment is significant, associated with less contributory climatic and ecological factors. For both models this study highlights the importance of considering the anthropogenic drivers for disease risk assessment in human, although CL is mainly linked to the sylvatic and peri-urban cycle in Meso and South America.

AB Background
   To improve schistosomiasis control programs in Uganda, where intestinal schistosomiasis is a widespread public health problem, a country-wide assessment of the disease prevalence among all age ranges is needed. Few studies have aimed to quantify the relationships between disease prevalence and water and sanitation characteristics across Uganda to understand the potential to interrupt disease transmission with an integrated package of interventions.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   A nationally representative survey was undertaken that included a household and individual questionnaire followed by disease testing based on detection of worm antigens (circulating cathodic antigen-CCA), diagnosis and treatment. A comprehensive set of questions was asked of randomly sampled individuals, two years of age and above, to understand their water and sanitation infrastructure, open defecation behaviors, exposure to surface water bodies, and knowledge of schistosomiasis. From a set of 170 randomly sampled, geographically diverse enumeration areas, a total of 9,183 study participants were included. After adjustment with sample weights, the national prevalence of schistosomiasis was 25.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 22.3, 29.0) with children ages two to four most at risk for the disease with 36.1% infected (95% CI: 30.1, 42.2). The defecation behaviors of an individual were more strongly associated with infection status than the household water and sanitation infrastructure, indicating the importance of incorporating behavior change into community-led total sanitation coverage.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Our results highlight the importance of incorporating monitoring and evaluation data into control programs in Uganda to understand the geographic distribution of schistosomiasis prevalence outside of communities where endemicity is known to be high. The high prevalence of schistosomiasis among the youngest age group, ineligible to receive drug treatment, shows the imperative to develop a child-appropriate drug protocol that can be safely administered to preschool-aged children. Water and sanitation interventions should be considered an essential investment for elimination alongside drug treatment.

AB Bacillus anthracis and Yersinia pestis are zoonotic bacteria capable of causing severe and sometimes fatal infections in animals and humans. Although considered as diseases of antiquity in industrialized countries due to animal and public health improvements, they remain endemic in vast regions of the world disproportionally affecting the poor. These pathogens also remain a serious threat if deployed in biological warfare. A single vaccine capable of stimulating rapid protection against both pathogens would be an extremely advantageous public health tool. We produced multiple-antigen fusion proteins (MaF1 and MaF2) containing protective regions from B. anthracis protective antigen (PA) and lethal factor (LF), and from Y. pestis V antigen (LcrV) and fraction 1 (F1) capsule. The MaF2 sequence was also expressed from a plasmid construct (pDNA-MaF2). Immunogenicity and protective efficacy were investigated in mice following homologous and heterologous prime-boost immunization. Antibody responses were determined by ELISA and anthrax toxin neutralization assay. Vaccine efficacy was determined against lethal challenge with either anthrax toxin or Y. pestis. Both constructs elicited LcrV and LF-specific serum IgG, and MaF2 elicited toxin-neutralizing antibodies. Immunizations with MaF2 conferred 100% and 88% protection against Y. pestis and anthrax toxin, respectively. In contrast, pDNA-MaF2 conferred only 63% protection against Y. pestis and no protection against anthrax toxin challenge. pDNA-MaF2-prime MaF2-boost induced 75% protection against Y. pestis and 25% protection against anthrax toxin. Protection was increased by the molecular adjuvant CARDif. In conclusion, MaF2 is a promising multi-antigen vaccine candidate against anthrax and plague that warrants further investigation.

AB Background
   Amoebiasis, caused by Entamoeba histolytica infection, is a global public health problem. However, available drugs to treat amoebiasis are currently limited, and no effective vaccine exists. Therefore, development of new preventive measures against amoebiasis is urgently needed.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   Here, to develop new drugs against amoebiasis, we focused on E. histolytica adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate kinase (EhAPSK), an essential enzyme in Entamoeba sulfolipid metabolism. Fatty alcohol disulfates and cholesteryl sulfate, sulfolipids synthesized in Entamoeba, play important roles in trophozoite proliferation and cyst formation. These processes are closely associated with clinical manifestation and severe pathogenesis of amoebiasis and with disease transmission, respectively. We validated a combination approach of in silico molecular docking analysis and an in vitro enzyme activity assay for large scale screening. Docking simulation ranked the binding free energy between a homology modeling structure of EhAPSK and 400 compounds. The 400 compounds were also screened by a 96-well plate-based in vitro APSK activity assay. Among fifteen compounds identified as EhAPSK inhibitors by the in vitro system, six were ranked by the in silico analysis as having high affinity toward EhAPSK. Furthermore, 2-(3-fluorophenoxy)-N-[4-(2-pyridyl)thiazol-2-yl]-acetamide, 3-phenyl-N-[4-(2-pyridyl)thiazol-2-yl]-imidazole-4-carboxamide, and auranofin, which were identified as EhAPSK inhibitors by both in silico and in vitro analyses, halted not only Entamoeba trophozoite proliferation but also cyst formation. These three compounds also dose-dependently impaired the synthesis of sulfolipids in E. histolytica.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Hence, the combined approach of in silico and in vitro-based EhAPSK analyses identified compounds that can be evaluated for their effects on Entamoeba. This can provide leads for the development of new anti-amoebic and amoebiasis transmission-blocking drugs. This strategy can also be applied to identify specific APSK inhibitors, which will benefit research into sulfur metabolism and the ubiquitous pathway terminally synthesizing essential sulfur-containing biomolecules.

TI Epidemiology, ecology and human perceptions of snakebites in a savanna
   community of northern Ghana
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID PSAMMOPHIS-PHILLIPSI; BITE
AB Background
   Worldwide, snakebite envenomations total similar to 2.7 million reported cases annually with similar to 100,000 fatalities. Since 2009, snakebite envenomation has intermittently been classified as a very important 'neglected tropical disease' by the World Health Organisation. Despite this emerging awareness, limited efforts have been geared towards addressing the serious public health implications of snakebites, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where baseline epidemiological and ecological data remain incomplete. Due to poverty as well as limited infrastructure and public health facilities, people in rural Africa, including Ghana, often have no other choice than to seek treatment from traditional medical practitioners (TMPs). The African 'snakebite crisis' is highlighted here using regionally representative complementary data from a community-based epidemiological and ecological study in the savanna zone of northern Ghana.
   Methodology and findings
   Our baseline study involved two data collection methods in the Savelugu-Nanton District (in 2019 the district was separated into Savelugu and Nanton districts) in northern Ghana, comprising a cross-sectional study of 1,000 residents and 24 TMPs between December 2008 and May 2009. Semi-structured interviews, as well as collection of retrospective snakebite and concurrent rainfall records from the Savelugu-Nanton District Hospital and Ghana Meteorological Authority respectively over 10-years (1999-2008) were used in the study. Variables tested included demography, human activity patterns, seasonality, snake ecology and clinical reports. Complementary data showed higher snakebite prevalence during the rainy season, and a hump-shaped correlation between rainfall intensity and snakebite incidences. Almost 6% of respondents had experienced a personal snakebite, whereas similar to 60% of respondents had witnessed a total of 799 snakebite cases. Out of a total of 857 reported snakebite cases, 24 (similar to 2.8%) died. The highest snakebite prevalence was recorded for males in the age group 15-44 years during farming activities, with most bites occurring in the leg/foot region. The highest snakebite rate was within farmlands, most severe bites frequently caused by the Carpet viper (Echis ocellatus).
   Conclusion
   The relatively high community-based prevalence of similar to 6%, and case fatality ratio of similar to 3%, indicate that snakebites represent an important public health risk in northern Ghana. Based on the high number of respondents and long recording period, we believe these data truly reflect the general situation in the rural northern savanna zone of Ghana and West Africa at large. We recommend increased efforts from both local and international health authorities to address the current snakebite health crisis generally compromising livelihoods and productivity of rural farming communities in West Africa.

TI Gambian human African trypanosomiasis in North West Uganda. Are we on

SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID EPIDEMIOLOGIC SURVEILLANCE
AB In 1994, combined active and passive screening reported 1469 cases from the historic Gambian Human African Trypanosomiasis (gHAT) foci of West Nile, Uganda. Since 2011 systematic active screening has stopped and there has been reliance on passive screening. During 2014, passive screening alone detected just nine cases. In the same year a tsetse control intervention was expanded to cover the main gHAT foci in West Nile to curtail transmission of gHAT contributing to the elimination of gHAT as a public health problem in the area. It is known that sole reliance on passive screening is slow to detect cases and can underestimate the actual true number. We therefore undertook an active screening programme designed to test the efficacy of these interventions against gHAT transmission and clarify disease status. Screening was conducted in 28 randomly selected villages throughout the study area, aiming to sample all residents. Whole blood from 10,963 participants was analysed using CATT and 97 CATT suspects (0.9%) were evaluated with microscopy and trypanolysis. No confirmed cases were found providing evidence that the gHAT prevention programmes in West Nile have been effective. Results confirm gHAT prevalence in the study area of West Nile is below the elimination threshold (1 new case / 10,000 population), making elimination on course across this study area if status is maintained. The findings of this study can be used to guide future HAT and tsetse management in other gHAT foci, where reduced caseloads necessitate a shift from active to passive screening.

AB Antimicrobial resistance is one of the major public health threats of the 21st century. There is a pressing need to adopt more efficient treatment strategies in order to prevent the emergence and spread of resistant strains. The common approach is to treat patients with high drug doses, both to clear the infection quickly and to reduce the risk of de novo resistance. Recently, several studies have argued that, at least in some cases, low-dose treatments could be more suitable to reduce the within-host emergence of antimicrobial resistance. However, the choice of a drug dose may have consequences at the population level, which has received little attention so far. Here, we study the influence of the drug dose on resistance and disease management at the host and population levels. We develop a nested two-strain model and unravel trade-offs in treatment benefits between an individual and the community. We use several measures to evaluate the benefits of any dose choice. Two measures focus on the emergence of resistance, at the host level and at the population level. The other two focus on the overall treatment success: the outbreak probability and the disease burden. We find that different measures can suggest different dosing strategies. In particular, we identify situations where low doses minimize the risk of emergence of resistance at the individual level, while high or intermediate doses prove most beneficial to improve the treatment efficiency or even to reduce the risk of resistance in the population.

   MANAGEMENT; UGANDA; TIME
AB Author summaryWhy was this study done? One of the largest contributors to preventable deaths in low- and middle-income countries is poor quality of care delivered by the public health system. Yet, given the multiple dimensions of care quality, there are currently no standard measures to evaluate impacts in this domain. While health system strengthening (HSS) initiatives strive to simultaneously increase access to healthcare and improve care quality, few studies have evaluated the impact of HSS initiatives on both targets. Our study sought to determine whether an HSS intervention in a rural health district of Madagascar, one of the world's poorest countries, improved the quality of maternal and child care at the population level. What did the researchers do and find? We used data from a district-representative open longitudinal cohort that followed over 1,500 households between 2014 and 2016, in order to compare trends in the content of care as a proxy for care quality, inside and outside the intervention catchment, through difference-in-differences analyses. We also analysed data from a Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) conducted in health facilities supported by the HSS intervention. Our data set included self-reported information on health seeking behaviors and care content for common illnesses of children under five ( = 657 in 2014; 411 in 2016), and for maternal care before and during live births that occurred in the previous two years ( = 552 in 2014; 524 in 2016). nnWe found that compared to the non-intervention group, the intervention group experienced a larger improvement in most care content outputs for childhood illnesses (e.g., 24.4% more children with diarrhea were prescribed oral rehydration therapy after two years than in the non-intervention area) and for perinatal care, whereas trends in antenatal care content were more similar in both populations. Despite progress, there remained important gaps in the provision of essential health services for individuals in both the intervention and non-intervention groups. What do these findings mean? The study provides evidence that HSS initiatives can successfully increase access to healthcare in target populations while also improving the quality of certain primary care services provided. The approach used here can be adapted to other local HSS initiatives to stimulate more comprehensive impact evaluations. Evidence from this study can help guide investments in integrated primary care systems that are needed globally to improve maternal and child care. The interpretation of the study findings is limited by the absence of randomization in the allocation of the intervention's programs and by the reliance on self-reported answers.
   Background In order to reach the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, gains attained in access to primary healthcare must be matched by gains in the quality of services delivered. Despite the broad consensus around the need to address quality, studies on the impact of health system strengthening (HSS) have focused predominantly on measures of healthcare access. Here, we examine changes in the content of maternal and child care as a proxy for healthcare quality, to better evaluate the effectiveness of an HSS intervention in a rural district of Madagascar. The intervention aimed at improving system readiness at all levels of care (community health, primary health centers, district hospital) through facility renovations, staffing, equipment, and training, while removing logistical and financial barriers to medical care (e.g., ambulance network and user-fee exemptions). Methods and findings We carried out a district-representative open longitudinal cohort study, with surveys administered to 1,522 households in the Ifanadiana district of Madagascar at the start of the HSS intervention in 2014, and again to 1,514 households in 2016. We examined changes in healthcare seeking behavior and outputs for sick-child care among children <5 years old, as well as for antenatal care and perinatal care among women aged 15-49. We used a difference-in-differences (DiD) analysis to compare trends between the intervention group (i.e., people living inside the HSS catchment area) and the non-intervention comparison group (i.e., the rest of the district). In addition, we used health facility-based surveys, monitoring service availability and readiness, to assess changes in the operational capacities of facilities supported by the intervention. The cohort study included 657 and 411 children (mean age = 2 years) reported to be ill in the 2014 and 2016 surveys, respectively (27.8% and 23.8% in the intervention group for each survey), as well as 552 and 524 women (mean age = 28 years) reported to have a live birth within the previous two years in the 2014 and 2016 surveys, respectively (31.5% and 29.6% in the intervention group for each survey). Over the two-year study period, the proportion of people who reported seeking care at health facilities experienced a relative change of +51.2% (from 41.4% in 2014 to 62.5% in 2016) and -7.1% (from 30.0% to 27.9%) in the intervention and non-intervention groups, respectively, for sick-child care (DiD p-value = 0.01); +11.4% (from 78.3% to 87.2%), and +10.3% (from 67.3% to 74.2%) for antenatal care (p-value = 0.75); and +66.2% (from 23.1% to 38.3%) and +28.9% (from 13.9% to 17.9%) for perinatal care (p-value = 0.13). Most indicators of care content, including rates of medication prescription and diagnostic test administration, appeared to increase more in the intervention compared to in the non-intervention group for the three areas of care we assessed. The reported prescription rate for oral rehydration therapy among children with diarrhea changed by +68.5% (from 29.6% to 49.9%) and -23.2% (from 17.8% to 13.7%) in the intervention and non-intervention groups, respectively (p-value = 0.05). However, trends observed in the care content varied widely by indicator and did not always match the large apparent increases observed in care seeking behavior, particularly for antenatal care, reflecting important gaps in the provision of essential health services for individuals who sought care.
   The main limitation of this study is that the intervention catchment was not randomly allocated, and some demographic indicators were better for this group at baseline than for the rest of the district, which could have impacted the trends observed. Conclusion Using a district-representative longitudinal cohort to assess the content of care delivered to the population, we found a substantial increase over the two-year study period in the prescription rate for ill children and in all World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended perinatal care outputs assessed in the intervention group, with more modest changes observed in the non-intervention group. Despite improvements associated with the HSS intervention, this study highlights the need for further quality improvement in certain areas of the district's healthcare system. We show how content of care, measured through standard population-based surveys, can be used as a component of HSS impact evaluations, enabling healthcare leaders to track progress as well as identify and address specific gaps in the provision of services that extend beyond care access.

AB Background Evidence on the association between breastfeeding and later childhood obesity and blood pressure (BP) is inconsistent, especially in HIV-prevalent areas where, until recently, HIV-infected women were discouraged from breastfeeding, but obesity is increasingly prevalent. Methods and findings The Siyakhula cohort (2012-2014), a population-based prospective cohort study, collected data over 3 visits on HIV-negative children ages 7 to 11 years in rural South Africa. We used weight (body mass index [BMI]), fat, and BP as outcome variables and incorporated early life (including mother's age at delivery and HIV status) and current life factors (including maternal education and current BMI). Our primary exposure was breastfeeding duration. We dichotomized 3 outcome measures using pre-established thresholds for clinical interpretability: (1) overfat: >= 85th percentile of body fat; (2) overweight: >1 SD BMI z score; and (3) prehypertension: >= 90th percentile for systolic BP (SBP) or diastolic BP (DBP). We modelled each outcome using multivariable logistic regression, including stopping breastfeeding, then early life, and finally current life factors. Of 1,536 children (mean age = 9.3 years; 872 girls; 664 boys), 7% were overfat, 13.2% overweight, and 9.1% prehypertensive. Over half (60%) of the mothers reported continued breastfeeding for 12+ months. In multivariable analyses, continued breastfeeding between 6 and 11 months was associated with approximately halved odds of both being overfat (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21-0.91, P = 0.027) and overweight (aOR = 0.46, CI 0.26-0.82, P = 0.0083), but the association with prehypertension did not reach statistical significance (aOR = 0.72, CI 0.38-1.37, P = 0.32). Children with a mother who was currently obese were 5 times more likely (aOR = 5.02, CI 2.47-10.20, P < 0.001) to be overfat and over 4 times more likely to be overweight (aOR = 4.33, CI 2.65-7.09, P < 0.001) than children with normal weight mothers. Differences between HIV-exposed and unexposed children on any of the outcomes were minimal and not significant. The main study limitation was that duration of breastfeeding was based on maternal recall. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first study examining and quantifying the association between breastfeeding and childhood obesity in an African setting with high HIV prevalence. We observed that breastfeeding was independently associated with reduced childhood obesity for both HIV-exposed and unexposed children, suggesting that promoting optimal nutrition throughout the life course, starting with continued breastfeeding, may be critical to tackling the growing obesity epidemic. In the era of widespread effective antiretroviral treatment for HIV-infected women for life, these data further support the recommendation of breastfeeding for all women.
   Author summaryWhy was this study done? Mounting evidence suggests a protective association between being breastfed and later obesity, mostly from resource-rich settings where HIV is not highly prevalent. However, data are inconsistent, with methodological problems including confounding with socioeconomic status (SES), which may influence both breastfeeding and later childhood obesity, small studies with the potential to overestimate the effects of breastfeeding, and a lack of studies allowing for maternal HIV status (HIV-infected women were, until recently, discouraged from breastfeeding because of concerns about postnatal transmission to the child). To our knowledge, this is the first study examining breastfeeding and childhood obesity in an African setting with high HIV rates where many women chose and were supported to breastfeed. What did the researchers do and find? We examined the association between breastfeeding, HIV exposure, and later childhood obesity, overfatness, and blood pressure (BP) in a large cohort of rural South African children. We found that breastfeeding beyond 6 months was associated with half the odds of both being overfat and overweight in children aged 7 to 11 years. Differences between children of HIV-positive and HIV-negative mothers in terms of their body fat, body mass index (BMI), and BP were small and not statistically significant. What do these findings mean? We provide evidence confirming that public health promotion of optimal nutrition through breastfeeding in early life has benefits that extend into midchildhood, for both children exposed to maternal HIV infection and those not exposed. Our findings suggest that, with the advent of widespread effective antiretroviral treatment for all HIV-infected pregnant women for life, which negates mother-to-child transmission risk, breastfeeding guidance could be considered for all women irrespective of maternal HIV status. This is especially pertinent as obesity levels and the number of HIV-exposed children continue to increase in many African settings. Future studies using prospective information on breastfeeding may be able to further clarify the protective effects of long-term breastfeeding on later child outcomes and explore the importance of when and what types of other foods or liquids are introduced into children's diets.

AB Author summaryWhy was this study done? Child acute malnutrition (AM) is a serious public health problem affecting 52 million children under the age of 5 years worldwide. Background Community-based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) has been widely adopted to treat childhood acute malnutrition (AM), but its effectiveness in program settings is often limited by implementation constraints, low screening coverage, and poor treatment uptake and adherence. This study addresses the problem of low screening coverage by testing the impact of distributing small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNSs) at monthly screenings held by community health volunteers (CHVs). Screening sessions included behavior change communication (BCC) on nutrition, health, and hygiene practices (both study arms) and SQ-LNSs (one study arm). Impact was assessed on AM screening and treatment coverage and on AM incidence and prevalence. Methods and findings A two-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial in 48 health center catchment areas in the Bla and San health districts in Mali was conducted from February 2015 to April 2017. In both arms, CHVs led monthly AM screenings in children 6-23 months of age and provided BCC to caregivers. The intervention arm also received a monthly supply of SQ-LNSs to stimulate caregivers' participation and supplement children's diet. We used two study designs: i) a repeated cross-sectional study (n = approximately 2,300) with baseline and endline surveys to examine impacts on AM screening and treatment coverage and prevalence (primary study outcomes) and ii) a longitudinal study of children enrolled at 6 months of age (n = 1,132) and followed monthly for 18 months to assess impact on AM screening and treatment coverage and incidence (primary study outcomes). All analyses were done by intent to treat. The intervention significantly increased AM screening coverage (cross-sectional study: +40 percentage points [pp], 95% confidence interval [CI]: 32, 49, p < 0.001; longitudinal study: +28 pp, 95% CI: 23, 33, p < 0.001). No impact on treatment coverage or AM prevalence was found. Children in the intervention arm, however, were 29% (95% CI: 8, 46; p = 0.017) less likely to develop a first AM episode (incidence) and, compared to children in comparison arm, their overall risk of AM (longitudinal prevalence) was 30% (95% CI: 12, 44; p = 0.002) lower. The intervention lowered CMAM enrollment by 10 pp (95% CI: 1.9, 18; p = 0.016), an unintended negative impact likely due to CHVs handing out preventive SQ-LNSs to caregivers of AM children instead of referring them to the CMAM program. Study limitations were i) the referral of AM cases by our research team (for ethical reasons) during monthly measurements in the longitudinal study might have interfered with usual CMAM activities and ii) the outcomes presented by child age also reflect seasonal variations because of the closed cohort design. Conclusions Incorporating SQ-LNSs into monthly community-level AM screenings and BCC sessions was highly effective at improving screening coverage and reducing AM incidence, but it did not improve AM prevalence or treatment coverage. Future evaluation and implementation research on CMAM should carefully assess and tackle the remaining barriers that prevent AM cases from being correctly diagnosed, referred, and adequately treated.

AB Author summaryWhy was this study done? Expectations of healthcare quality are believed to influence how patients experience and rate healthcare; however, little is known about expectations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). High satisfaction with poor-quality care is common in LMICs; one possible explanation is that expectations of care are low. This study was conducted to better understand expectations of healthcare quality in LMICs. What did the researchers do and find? We used an innovative internet sampling methodology to collect information from 17,996 individuals in 12 LMICs. Vignettes describing poor-quality care were used to elicit expectations of healthcare; good ratings for poor-quality care approximate low expectations. Over half of respondents (53%) rated the poor-quality care vignettes as good quality or better; low expectations were more likely if respondents were less educated, were male, reported good personal health, or had experienced discrimination during a healthcare visit in the past. What do these findings mean? Internet users in LMICs are a relatively privileged subgroup in our study countries, limiting the generalizability of our findings. Populations with low expectations are more likely to be satisfied with poor-quality care, reducing the demand-side pressure that health systems experience to deliver high-quality care. Raising expectations of quality may be one approach to improving the quality of healthcare in LMICs.
   Background High satisfaction with healthcare is common in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), despite widespread quality deficits. This may be due to low expectations because people lack knowledge about what constitutes good quality or are resigned about the quality of available services. Methods and findings We fielded an internet survey in Argentina, China, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Lebanon, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, and South Africa in 2017 (N = 17,996). It included vignettes describing poor-quality services-inadequate technical or interpersonal care-for 2 conditions. After applying population weights, most of our respondents lived in urban areas (59%), had finished primary school (55%), and were under the age of 50 (75%). Just over half were men (51%), and the vast majority reported that they were in good health (73%). Over half (53%) of our study population rated the quality of vignettes describing poor-quality services as good or better. We used multilevel logistic regression and found that good ratings were associated with less education (no formal schooling versus university education; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.22, 95% CI 1.90-2.59, P < 0.001), better self-reported health (excellent versus poor health; AOR 5.19, 95% CI 4.33-6.21, P < 0.001), history of discrimination in healthcare (AOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.36-1.57, P < 0.001), and male gender (AOR 1.32, 95% CI 1.23-1.41, P < 0.001). The survey did not reach nonusers of the internet thus only representing the internet-using population. Conclusions Majorities of the internet-using public in 12 LMICs have low expectations of healthcare quality as evidenced by high ratings given to poor-quality care. Low expectations of health services likely dampen demand for quality, reduce pressure on systems to deliver quality care, and inflate satisfaction ratings. Policies and interventions to raise people's expectations of the quality of healthcare they receive should be considered in health system quality reforms.

TI Association of social contact with dementia and cognition: 28-year
   follow-up of the Whitehall II cohort study

   DECLINE; AGE
AB Author summaryWhy was this study done? There is a need to identify lifestyle factors that affect the risk of developing dementia so that prevention efforts can be appropriately targeted. Previous studies show that having less frequent social contact with others is associated with higher dementia risk, but short follow-up in these studies means that this could be due to social isolation being an early consequence, rather than a cause, of dementia. What did the researchers do and find? We used data from 10,228 participants of the Whitehall II study, aged 45 years on average at the beginning of the study, who were asked on six occasions between 1985 and 2013 about their frequency of social contact with friends and relatives. Participants completed cognitive tests administered five times between 1997 and 2016 and were followed through electronic health records until 2017 to ascertain dementia diagnosis. We found that greater frequency of social contact at age 60 years was associated with lower risk of developing dementia and that this association was linked to social contact with friends rather than relatives. We found that more frequent midlife social contact was associated with higher subsequent cognitive performance, with cognitive differences between those with high and low social contact frequency maintained during average 15 years of cognitive follow-up. What do these findings mean? Our analysis suggests that more frequent social contact during early and midlife may build cognitive reserve, which is maintained and delays or prevents the clinical expression of dementia. An alternative explanation for our findings is that early cognitive differences could affect individuals' subsequent ability to establish and maintain social relationships, as well as increase susceptibility to later dementia. A limitation is that our study derived cases of dementia from health records, which has the potential to miss cases of dementia in people who are more socially isolated, which would be likely to underestimate the association between social contact and dementia.
   Background There is need to identify targets for preventing or delaying dementia. Social contact is a potential target for clinical and public health studies, but previous observational studies had short follow-up, making findings susceptible to reverse causation bias. We therefore examined the association of social contact with subsequent incident dementia and cognition with 28 years' follow-up. Methods and findings We conducted a retrospective analysis of the Whitehall II longitudinal prospective cohort study of employees of London civil service departments, aged 35-55 at baseline assessment in 1985-1988 and followed to 2017. Social contact was measured six times through a self-report questionnaire about frequency of contact with non-cohabiting relatives and friends. Dementia status was ascertained from three linked clinical and mortality databases, and cognition was assessed five times using tests of verbal memory, verbal fluency, and reasoning. Cox regression models with inverse probability weighting to account for attrition and missingness examined the association between social contact at age 50, 60, and 70 years and subsequent incident dementia. Mixed linear models examined the association of midlife social contact between 45 and 55 years and cognitive trajectory during the subsequent 14 years. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, education, health behaviours, employment status, and marital status. Of 10,308 Whitehall II study participants, 10,228 provided social contact data (mean age 44.9 years [standard deviation (SD) 6.1 years] at baseline; 33.1% female; 89.1% white ethnicity). More frequent social contact at age 60 years was associated with lower dementia risk (hazard ratio [HR] for each SD higher social contact frequency = 0.88 [95% CI 0.79, 0.98], p = 0.02); effect size of the association of social contact at 50 or 70 years with dementia was similar (0.92 [95% CI 0.83, 1.02], p = 0.13 and 0.91 [95% CI 0.78, 1.06], p = 0.23, respectively) but not statistically significant. The association between social contact and incident dementia was driven by contact with friends (HR = 0.90 [95% CI 0.81, 1.00], p = 0.05), but no association was found for contact with relatives. More frequent social contact during midlife was associated with better subsequent cognitive trajectory: global cognitive function was 0.07 (95% CI 0.03, 0.11), p = 0.002 SDs higher for those with the highest versus lowest tertile of social contact frequency, and this difference was maintained over 14 years follow-up. Results were consistent in a series of post hoc analyses, designed to assess potential biases. A limitation of our study is ascertainment of dementia status from electronic health records rather than in-person assessment of diagnostic status, with the possibility that milder dementia cases were more likely to be missed. Conclusions Findings from this study suggest a protective effect of social contact against dementia and that more frequent contact confers higher cognitive reserve, although it is possible that the ability to maintain more social contact may be a marker of cognitive reserve. Future intervention studies should seek to examine whether improving social contact frequency is feasible, acceptable, and efficacious in changing cognitive outcomes.

TI Design and methods of Shape Up Under 5: Integration of systems science
   and community-engaged research to prevent early childhood obesity
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID INTERVENTIONS; DISPARITIES; DIFFUSION; NUTRITION; CHILDREN; WHOLE
AB Shape Up Under 5 (SUU5) was a two-year early childhood obesity prevention pilot study in Somerville, Massachusetts (2015-2017) designed to test a novel conceptual framework called Stakeholder-driven Community Diffusion. For whole-of-community interventions, this framework posits that diffusion of stakeholders' knowledge about and engagement with childhood obesity prevention efforts through their social networks will improve the implementation of health-promoting policy and practice changes intended to reduce obesity risk. SUU5 used systems science methods (agent-based modeling, group model building, social network analysis) to design, facilitate, and evaluate the work of 16 multisector stakeholders ('the Committee'). In this paper, we describe the design and methods of SUU5 using the conceptual framework: the approach to data collection, and methods and rationale for study inputs, activities and evaluation, which together may further our understanding of the hypothesized processes within Stakeholder-driven Community Diffusion. We also present a generalizable conceptual framework for addressing childhood obesity and similar complex public health issues through whole-of-community interventions.

TI Determinants of shingles vaccine acceptance in the United Kingdom

   ENGLAND; PROGRAM
AB Background
   The United Kingdom (UK) was the first European country to introduce a national immunisation program for shingles (2013-2014). That year, vaccination coverage ranged from 50 to 64% across the UK, but uptake has declined ever since. This study explored determinants of the acceptance of the shingles vaccine in the UK.
   Methods
   Vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, who were eligible for the last catch-up cohort of the 2014-2015 shingles vaccination campaign, were identified using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (the National Health Service data research service) and invited to participate by their general practitioner (GP). An anonymised self-administered questionnaire was developed using the Health Belief Model as a theoretical framework, to collect data on demographic and socio-economic characteristics, health status, knowledge, influences, experiences and attitudes to shingles and the shingles vaccine. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the factors associated with vaccination. Physicians' views concerning perceived barriers to vaccination were also assessed.
   Results
   Of the 2,530 questionnaires distributed, 536 were returned (21.2%) from 69 general practices throughout the UK. The majority of responders were female (58%), lived in care homes (56%) and had completed secondary or higher education (88%). There were no differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated responders. Being offered the shingles vaccine by a GP/nurse (odds ratio (OR) = 2.3), and self-efficacy (OR = 1.2) were associated with being vaccinated (p<0.05). In contrast, previous shingles history (OR = 0.4), perceived barriers to vaccination (OR = 0.7) and perceived control of the disease (OR = 0.7) were associated with not being vaccinated against shingles (p<0.05). Less than half (44.0%) of GPs were aware of the local communication campaigns regarding shingles and the shingles vaccine.
   Conclusions
   Socio-psychological factors largely influence shingles vaccination acceptance in this study. The results add to existing evidence that healthcare providers (HCPs) have a pivotal role against vaccine hesitancy. Campaigns focusing on GPs and accessible information offered to eligible members of the public can further enhance shingles vaccine uptake.

TI Learnt effects of environmental cues on transport-related walking;

   INTERVENTION; EVERYDAY LIFE; BEHAVIOR; EXERCISE; IMPLICIT; CONTEXT;
   TOLERANCE
AB Background
   In Ecological models, physical environments can be important determinants of transport-related walking. With repeated exposure to the same environment, learning of a linkage between the cues in the environment and walking should occur. Subsequent encounters with the cues can prompt the behaviour relatively automatically. No studies have experimentally tested the potential learning of this linkage between cues and behaviour. Choices between stairs and escalators in public access settings were employed to test this premise for transport-related walking.
   Methods
   Three studies investigated the effects of visual cues on stair/escalator choices (combined n = 115,062). In quasi-experimental, interrupted time-series designs, observers audited choices in public access settings. Design alone phases with art or coloured backgrounds were compared with design plus message phases in which verbal health promotion messages were superimposed on the visual cues. Analyses used bootstrapped logistic regression.
   Results
   In initial studies, the design alone phases had no effect whereas subsequent design plus message phases reduced escalator choice. In two further studies, a 5-6 week design plus message phase that reduced escalator choice preceded a design alone phase. The visual background behind the successful health promotion message was reintroduced four weeks after the intervention was removed. The visual cue of design alone reduced escalator choice after it had been paired with the verbal health promotion message. There were no differences between art and coloured backgrounds.
   Conclusion
   These studies demonstrate for the first time a learnt linkage between transport-related walking and environmental cues. Discussion focuses on the mechanisms that may underlie this learning and cues in the environment that are relevant to transport-related walking.

   DIFFERENCES; PUBLIC-HEALTH; POPULATION; PREVALENCE; EDUCATION;
   COMORBIDITY; COSTS; LIFE
AB Background
   People with multimorbidity have reduced functional capacity, lower quality of life, higher mortality rates and use healthcare resources more intensively than healthy people or those with a single chronic condition. Multimorbidity was defined as the coexistence of two or more chronic conditions in the same person. The aim of this study was to explore associations between multimorbidity and use of healthcare services and the impact of socioeconomic status on utilization of hospitalizations and bed days.
   Methods
   The study population included all individuals aged 16 years and older who lived in the Capital Region of Denmark on January 1st, 2012. Data on chronic conditions, use of healthcare services and demographics were obtained from Danish national administrative and health registries. Zero-inflated models were used to calculate anticipated annual use of hospitalizations and bed days.
   Findings
   The study population comprised 1,397,173 individuals; the prevalence of multimorbidity was 22%. Prevalence was inversely related to educational attainment. For people with multimorbidity, utilization of hospitalizations and bed days increased approximately linearly with the number of chronic conditions. However, a steep increase in utilization of bed days was observed between five and six or more chronic conditions. An educational gradient in hospitalization rates and use of bed days was observed regardless of the number of chronic conditions. Educational attainment was strongly associated with healthcare utilization.
   Conclusion
   Multimorbidity was associated with a significant increase in utilization of all healthcare services in Denmark. In addition, a socioeconomic gradient was observed in utilization of hospitalizations and bed days.

TI 'It's like a burden on the head': Redefining adequate menstrual hygiene
   management throughout women's varied life stages in Odisha, India
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID SANITATION EXPERIENCES; HEALTH; GIRLS; SCHOOLS
AB There has been growing recognition of menstrual hygiene management (MHM) as a significant public health issue. However, research has predominately focused on the experiences of adolescent girls in school settings. The purpose of this research is to examine detailed accounts of menstruation for women in rural Odisha, India at various life stages with a view toward improving international monitoring of MHM. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were conducted to understand women's experiences of menstruation across four life stages (unmarried women, recently married women, married women, and older women). Thematic analysis was used to identify menstruation-related challenges and needs. We found women voiced needs that aligned with those captured by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP) definition for MHM: access to clean materials, privacy for changing materials, soap and water for bathing, and disposal facilities for materials. However, we also found women require materials that are not only clean but comfortable and reliable; soap and water for more than bathing; privacy for the full spectrum of menstruation-related practices, not just when changing; and disposal facilities that are private and safe, not just accessible. Additionally, we identified needs that extend beyond the existing definition: pain management, social support, and an enabling sociocultural environment. Overall, women representing all life stages discussed menstruation challenges, including bathing, pain, and washing, drying, and storing cloth materials. Cloth management challenges were most acute for unmarried and recently married women, who were concerned that practices could reveal their menstrual status and harm their reputations, thus informing their preference for disposable materials, if attainable. We propose a revised definition of adequate MHM for this population that more comprehensively captures their needs. This definition may also prove useful for other populations, future research, creating measures of assessment, and guiding interventions and program priorities.

TI Methods to include persons living with HIV not receiving HIV care in the

ID UNITED-STATES; SURVEILLANCE DATA; INFECTION; SUPPRESSION; RETENTION;
   SYSTEM
AB The Medical Monitoring Project (MMP) is an HIV surveillance system that provides national estimates of HIV-related behaviors and clinical outcomes. When first implemented, MMP excluded persons living with HIV not receiving HIV care. This analysis will describe new case-surveillance-based methods to identify and recruit persons living with HIV who are out of care and at elevated risk for mortality and ongoing HIV transmission. Stratified random samples of all persons living with HIV were selected from the National HIV Surveillance System in five public health jurisdictions from 2012-2014. Sampled persons were located and contacted through seven different data sources and five methods of contact to collect interviews and medical record abstractions. Data were weighted for non-response and case reporting delay. The modified sampling methodology yielded 1159 interviews (adjusted response rate, 44.5%) and matching medical record abstractions for 1087 (93.8%). Of persons with both interview and medical record data, 264 (24.3%) would not have been included using prior MMP methods. Significant predictors were identified for successful contact (e.g., retention in care, adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 5.02; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.98-12.73), interview (e.g. moving out of jurisdiction, aOR 0.24; 95% CI: 0.12-0.46) and case reporting delay (e.g. rural residence, aOR 3.18; 95% CI: 2.09-4.85). Case-surveillance-based sampling resulted in a comparable response rate to existing MMP methods while providing information on an important new population. These methods have since been adopted by the nationally representative MMP surveillance system, offering a model for public health program, research and surveillance endeavors seeking inclusion of all persons living with HIV.

   LAW
AB The 2016 Frank Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (Lautenberg TSCA) amended the 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to mandate protection of susceptible and highly exposed populations. Program implementation entails a myriad of choices that can lead to different degrees of public health protections. Well-documented exposures to multiple industrial chemicals occur from air, soil, water, food, and products in our workplaces, schools, and homes. Many hazardous chemicals are associated with or known to cause health risks; for other industrial chemicals, no data exist to confirm their safety because of flaws in 1976 TSCA. Under the 2016 Lautenberg amendments, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must evaluate chemicals against risk-based safety standards under enforceable deadlines, with an explicit mandate to identify and assess risks to susceptible and highly exposed populations. Effective public health protection requires EPA to implement the Lautenberg TSCA requirements by incorporating intrinsic and extrinsic factors that affect susceptibility, adequately assessing exposure among vulnerable groups, and accurately identifying highly exposed groups. We recommend key scientific and risk assessment principles to inform health-protective chemical policy such as consideration of aggregate exposures from all pathways and, when data are lacking, the use of health-protective defaults.

TI Client experiences with antenatal care waiting times in southern

ID QUALITY
AB Background: Antenatal care (ANC) provides a range of critical health services during pregnancy that can improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes. In Mozambique, only half of women receive four or more ANC visits, which are provided for free at public health centers by maternal and child health (MCH) nurses. Waiting time has been shown to contribute to negative client experiences, which may be a driver of low maternity care utilization. A recent pilot study of a program to schedule ANC visits demonstrated that scheduling care reduces waiting time and results in higher rates of complete ANC. This study aims to explore client experiences with waiting time for ANC in standard practice and care and after the introduction of appointment scheduling.
   Methods: This study uses a series of qualitative interviews to unpack client experiences with ANC waiting time with and without scheduled care, in order to better understand the impact of waiting time on client experiences. Thirty-eight interviews were collected in May to June 2017 at three pilot study clinics in southern Mozambique, with a focus on two paired intervention and comparison facilities sharing similar facility characteristics. Data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis methods using NVivo software.
   Results: Clients described strong motivations to seek ANC, pointing to the need to address convenience of care, and highlighted direct and indirect costs of seeking care that were exacerbated by long waiting times. Direct costs include time and transport costs of going to the clinic, while indirect costs include being unable to fulfill household and work obligations. Other barriers to complete ANC utilization of four or more visits include transport costs, negative provider experiences, and delayed ANC initiation, which limit the potential number of clinic contacts.
   Conclusions: Findings demonstrate that the scheduling intervention improves the client experience of seeking care by allowing women to both seek ANC and fulfill other productive obligations. Innovation in healthcare delivery should consider adapting models that minimize waiting times.

AB Background: Human adenoviruses (HAdV) are important pathogens of pediatric respiratory tract infections in Taiwan. There were two major HAdV epidemics in southern Taiwan in 2011 and 2014, respectively.
   Methods: The demographic, clinical characteristics, and risk factors for hospitalization of pediatric patients with HAdV infection in the two outbreaks were retrospectively compared. The epidemic was defined as >7% HAdV detection rate for six consecutive weeks. HAdV infection was defined as positive HAdV isolates from respiratory tract specimens. HAdV genotype was determined by PCR-based hexon gene sequencing.
   Results: A total of 1145 pediatric patients were identified (635 cases in 2011; 510 cases in 2014). HAdV genotype 3 and 7 contributed to both epidemics, although the proportion of HAdV3 decreased significantly (64.7% in 2011 to 25.5% in 2014, p<0.001) and was replaced by other genotypes (type 1, 4, and 6) in the 2014 epidemic. Among the hospitalized patients, there were more patients hospitalized with bronchopneumonia/or pneumonia in the 2011 epidemic (10.6% vs 5.1%, p<0.001), while more patients hospitalized with acute pharyngitis/pharyngoconjunctival fever (63.9% vs. 38.6%, p<0.001) in the 2014 epidemic. In both epidemics, hospitalized patients had higher WBC and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels than non-hospitalized patients. Using multivariate regression analysis, underlying disease and elevated CRP levels were independent risk factors for hospitalization in both epidemics.
   Conclusion: There were significant differences in clinical, viral characteristics and risk factors of hospitalization between the 2011 and 2014 epidemics. Understanding changes in the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of HAdV epidemics is important from a public health perspective.

ID HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS VACCINATION; INCOME; COVERAGE; IMPACT; GIRLS
AB BackgroundIn Mozambique cervical cancer is a public health threat, due to its high incidence and limited access to early diagnosis of precancerous lesions. International organisations are supporting the introduction of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines in low- and middle-income countries. Some of these countries recently conducted demonstration programmes, which included evaluation of acceptability, coverage, and practicality of implementation and of integration in existing programmes. Information on costs of delivering the vaccine is needed to overcome the challenges of reaching vaccine potential recipients in rural and remote areas.MethodsWe estimated the financial and economic costs of delivering HPV vaccination to ten-year-old girls at schools for the first vaccination cycle of the demonstration programme inthe Manhica district (southern Mozambique), delivered throughout 2014. We also estimated costs of an alternative scenario with a reduced number of doses and personnel, which was analogous to the second vaccination cycle delivered throughout 2015. Cost estimates followed a micro-costing approach and included interviews with key informants at different administrative levels through the administration of standard questionnaires developed by the World Health Organisation.ResultsConsidering only data from the first vaccination cycle (2014), which consisted in the administration of three doses, the average economic cost was US$17.59per dose and US$52.29 per fully-immunised girl (FIG). Financial cost per dose (US$6.07) andper FIG (US$17.95) were substantially lower. The economic cost was US$15.53per dose and US$31.14 per FIG when estimating an alternative cost scenario with reduced number of doses and personnel.ConclusionsThe average economic cost per dose was lower than the ones recently reported for low- and middle-income countries. However, our estimation of the financial cost per FIG was higher than the ones observed elsewhere (ranging from US$2.49 in India to US$20.36 in Vietnam) due to the high percentage of out-of-school girls which, reduced vaccine coverage and, therefore, reduced the denominator. Due to budget constraints, if Mozambique is to implement nation-wide HPV vaccination targeted to ten-year-old girls at schools, a reduction in personnel costs should be operated either by restricting the outreach vaccinator team or the number of supervision visits.

AB BackgroundSelf-medication is a public health concern that may create several problems such as increase in drug resistance, raise in drug use per capita, and creating side effects. This study was conducted to determine predictors of self-medication based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) among the Iranian women.MethodsThis was a cross sectional study. A sample of married women completed a validated, anonymous, self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire included items on demographic variables, knowledge, and TPB structures, and the checklist of women's self-medication practices. The study was conducted in six urban health centers of Shush and Zarandieh in Iran during January to July 2016. Data were analyzed using SPSS 23.0 applying t-test and logistic regression.ResultsA total of 360 women took part in the study. The results showed that 76% of women had a history of self-medication and 98.9% stored drugs at home. The most important reasons for self-medication were perceived self-medication harmless (41%), having history of a disease (35.5%), and availability of medications at home (34%). The most frequent diseases for self-medication were fatigue, weakness, and anxiety (24%), and fever (20%). The results obtained form logistic regression analysis indicated that age, place of residence, education level, health insurance status, as well as all constructs of the TPB were significant predictors for self-medication.ConclusionThe findings indicated that the prevalence of self-medication among Iranian women was high. Since women have important role in shaping the family health, the issue of high prevalence among this population should be considered as a serious problem in Iran. In this regard, it is recommended to consider factors affecting self-medication among women to reduce this health threatening factors.

AB Introduction
   Intimate partner violence (IPV) is regarded an important public health and human rights issue, characterized by physical, sexual or emotional abuse. Globally more than one in three women report physical or sexual violence by their intimate partners. Though the association between IPV and depression is known, we found no study investigating depression as a risk factor for IPV and very few studies using standard tools in assessing both IPV and depression among pregnant women.
   Aim
   To measure the prevalence of IPV and depression during pregnancy and assess the association between IPV and depression and other determinants.
   Methods
   A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 589 pregnant women living in Wondo-Genet district, southern Ethiopia. IPV experience was assessed using a structured questionnaire of the World Health Organization (WHO), and maternal depression was measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Descriptive statistics were computed and multivariable logistic regression was carried out to estimate risk and adjust for confounders.
   Results
   The overall prevalence of IPV was 21% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 18.1-24.7). After adjusting for potential confounders, increased risk of IPV remained among rural women (adjusted odds ratio[AOR] = 2.09; 95% CI = 1.06-4.09), women who had parental exposure to IPV (AOR = 14.00; 95% CI = 6.43-30.48), women whose pregnancy was not desired (AOR = 9.64; 95% CI = 3.44-27.03), women whose husbands used alcohol (AOR = 17.08; 95% CI = 3.83-76.19), women with depression (AOR = 4.71; 95% CI = 1.37-16.18) and women with low social support (AOR = 13.93; 95% CI = 6.98-27.77). The prevalence of antenatal depressive symptom (with EPDS score above 13) was 6.8% (95% CI 6.2-11.3). Increased risk of depression was found among women who had been exposed to IPV (AOR = 17.60; 95% CI = 6.18-50.10) and whose husbands use alcohol (AOR = 3.31; 95% CI = 1.33-8.24).
   Conclusion
   One in five pregnant women experienced IPV and it was strongly associated with depression. Screening for IPV and depression at antenatal visits with referral to relevant care and service is recommended.

AB Oncology-associated adverse drug/device reactions can be fatal. Some clinicians who treat single patients with severe oncology-associated toxicities have researched case series and published this information. We investigated motivations and experiences of select individuals leading such efforts. Clinicians treating individual patients who developed oncology-associated serious adverse drug events were asked to participate. Inclusion criteria included having index patient information, reporting case series, and being collaborative with investigators from two National Institutes of Health funded pharmacovigilance networks. Thirty-minute interviews addressed investigational motivation, feedback from pharmaceutical manufacturers, FDA personnel, and academic leadership, and recommendations for improving pharmacovigilance. Responses were analyzed using constant comparative methods of qualitative analysis. Overall, 18 clinicians met inclusion criteria and 14 interviewees are included. Primary motivations were scientific curiosity, expressed by six clinicians. A less common theme was public health related (three clinicians). Six clinicians received feedback characterized as supportive from academic leaders, while four clinicians received feedback characterized as negative. Three clinicians reported that following the case series publication they were invited to speak at academic institutions worldwide. Responses from pharmaceutical manufacturers were characterized as negative by 12 clinicians. One clinician's wife called the post-reporting time the "Maalox month," while another clinician reported that the manufacturer collaboratively offered to identify additional cases of the toxicity. Responses from FDA employees were characterized as collaborative for two clinicians, neutral for five clinicians, unresponsive for negative by six clinicians. Three clinicians endorsed developing improved reporting mechanisms for individual physicians, while 11 clinicians endorsed safety activities that should be undertaken by persons other than a motivated clinician who personally treats a patient with a severe adverse drug/device reaction. Our study provides some of the first reports of clinician motivations and experiences with reporting serious or potentially fatal oncology-associated adverse drug or device reactions. Overall, it appears that negative feedback from pharmaceutical manufacturers and mixed feedback from the academic community and/or the FDA were reported. Big data, registries, Data Safety Monitoring Boards, and pharmacogenetic studies may facilitate improved pharmacovigilance efforts for oncology-associated adverse drug reactions. These initiatives overcome concerns related to complacency, indifference, ignorance, and system-level problems as barriers to documenting and reporting adverse drug events-barriers that have been previously reported for clinician reporting of serious adverse drug reactions.

AB BackgroundInfertility is considered one of the global public health problems and during human history, it is also considered one of the unsolved problems of the continuous human race. This study aimed to collect and document the ethnopharmacological data on herbal remedies, which traditionally used by Palestinian healers in the rural areas of the West Bank area for the treatment of infertility in males and females.MethodsUsing a semi-structured questionnaire, an ethnopharmacological survey of medicinal plants used for the treatment of infertility in the West Bank area of Palestine was investigated. This survey involved 51 traditional healers which were interviewed in rural areas from 9 Palestinian regions.ResultsInformation about 31 plants used in the treatment of infertility in females and 24 plants used in the treatment of infertility in males were collected. This information including names of plants, parts used, mode and methods of preparation which were obtained from 51 traditional healers interviewed in rural areas of 9 regions of the West Bank/Palestine. This investigation is the first scientific work in the Middle East area which collected information about herbal remedies used by local Palestinian traditional healers for the treatments of infertility in males and females. The highest Frequency of Citation (FC) of herbal remedies used in case of infertility in females, were 98.04% for pollen grains from Ceratonia siliqua, 88.24% for Anastatica hierochuntica fruits and 84.31% for Parietaria judaica leaves, while the highest Frequency of Citation (FC) of herbal remedies used in case of infertility in males were 96.08% for Ferula hermonis roots, 88.24% for Phlomis brachyodon leaves and 86.27% for Phoenix dactylifera pollen grains.ConclusionHerbal healers in the West Bank area of Palestine have a wide range of herbal remedies used in case of infertility in males and in females. Unfortunately, most of them lack scientific evidence of pharmacological or toxicological nature. Therefore, the information obtained in this study can serve as a scientific base for further investigations to determine their efficacy and safety which might contribute to better integration of Palestinian traditional medicine into the global health system in the future.

AB BackgroundMany low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) are moving towards enforcing prescription-only access to antibiotics. This systematic literature review aims to assess the interventions used to enforce existing legislation prohibiting over-the-counter (OTC) sales of antibiotics in LMICs, their impact and examine the methods chosen for impact measurement including their strengths and weaknesses.MethodsBoth PubMed and Embase were systematically searched for studies reporting on impact measurement in moving towards prescription only access to antibiotics in LMICs. The PRISMA methodological review framework was used to ensure systematic data collection and analysis of literature. Narrative data synthesis was used due to heterogeneity of study designs.ResultsIn total, 15 studies were included that assessed policy impact in 10 different countries. Strategies employed to enforce regulations prohibiting OTC sales of systemic antibiotics included retention of prescriptions for antibiotics by pharmacies, government inspections, engaging pharmacists in the design of interventions, media campaigns for the general public and educational activities for health care workers. A variety of outcomes was used to assess the policy impact; changes in antimicrobial resistance rates, changes in levels of antibiotic use, changes in trends of antibiotic use, changes in OTC supply of antibiotics, and changes in reported practices and knowledge of pharmacists, medicine sellers and the general public. Differences in methodological approaches and outcome assessment made it difficult to compare the effectiveness of law enforcement activities. Most effective appeared to be multifaceted approaches that involved all stakeholders. Monitoring of the impact on total sales of antibiotics by means of an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis and analysis of pharmacies selling antibiotics OTC using mystery clients were the methodologically strongest designs used.ConclusionsThe published literature describing activities to enforce prescription-only access to antibiotics in LMICs is sparse and offers limited guidance. Most likely to be effective are comprehensive multifaceted interventions targeting all stakeholders with regular reinforcement of messages. Policy evaluation should be planned as part of implementation to assess the impact and effectiveness of intervention strategies and to identify targets for further activities. Robust study designs such as ITS analyses and mystery client surveys should be used to monitor policy impact.

AB BackgroundDespite significant advances in surgical techniques, immunosuppression protocols, follow up periods and antimicrobial stewardship in modern medicine; post-renal transplantation urinary tract infection remained a major public health problem globally. This multiple serious squeals includes asymptomatic bacteriuria, cystitis and pyelonephritis. Among these, the bacterial origin of infection complications accounts for the most significant clinical, socio-economic impacts in many countries of the world. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence of bacterial isolates that cause urinary tract infections, assess antibiotic susceptibility pattern among symptomatic and asymptomatic renal transplant recipients attending at St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.MethodsA hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from December 2017 to August 2018 among 74 renal transplant recipients St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A first morning voided clean-catch mid-stream urine specimens were collected and 0.001ml inoculated onto blood and MacConkey agar plates following the standard bacteriological protocols. It was incubated aerobically at 35-37 degrees C for 24-48h. Cultural characteristics and series of biochemical tests were used for the identification of isolates to species level based on the standard bacteriological protocols.ResultsA hospital-based cross-sectional study has shown that significant bacteriuria was found in 11/74 (14.9, 95% CI =8.2-24.7) patients. The prevalence among females 6/32 (18.75%) was higher among males 5/42 (11.9%) without significant association (COR=2.09, 95% CI=1.04-8.45, P=0.253). Urinary tract infection was higher in the age group of 35-49years old (19.3%). Age was statistically significant and stronger independent associated risk factor with crude odds ratio=3.67, 95% CI=2.89-20.07 and P=0.003, respectively. The most prevalent bacteria isolates were Escherichia coli 2(18.2%), Staphylococcus aureus 2(18.2%), Acinetobacter spp. 2(18.2%), Enterococcus spp. 2(18.2%), Coagulase-negative Staphylococci 2(18.2%) followed by Porteus mirabilis 1(9.1%).The majority (80%) of Gram-negative bacteria were resistant to ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Simultaneously, the multidrug-resistant bacterial isolates accounts for 82% among tested kidney allograft recipients.ConclusionsIn conclusion, the overall prevalence of urinary tract infection in the study participants was relatively low with a prevalence of 14.9%. Majority of the study participants were asymptomatic and a higher percentage of females were involved. The multidrug-resistant bacterial isolates in the present study account for 82%.

AB BackgroundSince there is a paucity of research on support for people using Anabolic Androgenic Steroids (AAS), we aimed to identify and synthesise the available evidence in this field. Gaining an understanding of the support both accessed and wanted by recreational AAS users will be of use to professionals who provide services to intravenous substance users and also to those working in the fields of public health and social care, with the aim to increase engagement of those using AAS.MethodsA systematic scoping review of the literatureto explore and identify the nature and scope of information and support both accessed and wanted by non-prescribed AAS users. Any support services or information designed to help people who use AAS were considered.ResultsWe identified 23 papers and one report for review, which indicated that AAS users access a range of sources of information on: how to inject, substance effectiveness, dosages and side effects, suggesting this is the type of information users want. AAS users sought support from a range of sources including medical professionals, needle and syringe programmes, friends, dealers, and via the internet, suggesting that, different sources were used dependent on the information or support sought.DiscussionAAS users tended to prefer peer advice and support over that of professionals, and access information online via specialist forums, reflecting the stigma that is experienced by AAS users. These tendencies can act as barriers to accessing services provided by professionals.ConclusionsSupport needs to be specific and targeted towards AAS users. Sensitivity to their perceptions of their drug-use and the associated stigma of being classified in the same sub-set as other illicit drug users is relevant to facilitating successful engagement.

AB BackgroundRoad traffic accidents (RTA) remain a global public health concern in developing countries. The aim of the study was to document the frequency, characteristics and hospital outcomes of road traffic accidents in Guinea from 2015 to 2017.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using medical records of RTA victims from 20 hospitals and a cross-sectional study of RTA cases from eight police stations in eight districts in Guinea, West Africa. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, trends of RTA, a sequence of interrupted time-series models and a segmented ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression.ResultsPolice stations recorded 3,140 RTA over 3 years with an overall annual increase in RTA rates from 14.0 per 100,000 population in 2015, to 19.2 per 100,000 population in 2016 (37.1% annual increase), to 28.7 per 100,000 population in 2017 (49.5% annual increase).Overall, the injury rates in 2016 and 2017 were .05 per 100,000 population higher on average per month (95% CI: .03-.07). Deaths from RTA showed no statistical differences over the 3 years and no association of RTA trends with season was found.Overall, 27,751 RTA victims were admitted to emergency units, representing 22% of all hospitals admissions. Most victims were males (71%) and young (33%). Deaths represented 1.4% of all RTA victims. 90% of deaths occurred beforeor within 24 h of hospital admission. Factors associated with death were being male (p=.04), being a child under 15years (p=.045) or an elderly person aged >= 65years (p<.001), and having head injury or coma (p<.001).ConclusionsRTA rates in Guinea are increasing. There is a need for implementing multisectoral RTA prevention measures in Guinea.

AB BackgroundMany tropical countries are currently experiencing dengue (DEN), chikungunya (CHIK) and also more recently Zika (ZIKA) epidemics (particularly in Latin America). Although the risk of transmission and spread of these infections in temperate regions remains a controversial issue, vector-borne diseases have been widely reported in the media and have been the focus of preventive strategies by national and international policy-makers and public health authorities. In this context, we wanted to determine the extent of risk perception in infectious diseases (ID) physicians of the current and future risk of arboviral disease introduction, autochthonous case development and epidemic scenarios in France, Western Europe.MethodsTo this aim, we developed an original standardized questionnaire survey which was disseminated by the French Infectious Diseases Society to ID physician members.ResultsWe found that ID physicians perceived the risk of introduction and outbreak development of DEN, CHIK and ZIKA in France to be low to medium-low. Generalized Linear Model(s) identified medical school training, the extent of professional experience, and awareness of the French national plan regarding arboviral infections as significant predictors for lower risk perception among respondents.ConclusionDespite the fact that arboviral diseases are increasingly being imported into France, sometimes resulting in sporadic autochtonous transmission, French ID physicians do not perceive the risk as high. Better communication and education targeting health professionals and citizens will be needed to enhance the effectiveness of the French national plan to prepare against arboviral diseases.

AB BackgroundReform of the health care system in China has prompted concerns about the utilization of mental health services. This study aims to compare the utilization of mental health services among inpatients in various types of health institutions in Shanghai (community health care centres, secondary general hospitals, tertiary general hospitals, and specialty hospitals).MethodsBased on electronic health record (EHR) data, we extracted all of the mental hospitalization data from various types of public health institutions in Pudong New Area, Shanghai, China, from 2013 to 2016. The distribution of mentally ill inpatients and the possible factors contributing to the observed differences in these institutions were analysed.ResultsSpecialty psychiatric hospitals in Pudong New Area, Shanghai, admitted more inpatients and treated in patients with more severe disorders (49.73%). However, those who were male (OR=0.545), were elderly (OR=20.133), had inferior insurance (urban social insurance for citizens: OR=4.013; paying themselves, OR=29.489), had a longer length of stay (OR=1.001) and had lower costs (OR=0.910) were more likely to choose community health centres than specialty hospitals. Those who preferred the secondary and tertiary hospitals to the specialty ones were more likely to be in the male, elderly, married, shorter length of stay and higher-cost groups. Notably, compared to those with urban social insurance for workers, those who had urban social insurance for citizens (OR=3.136) or paid out-of-pocket (OR=9.822) were significantly clustered in the tertiary hospitals rather than the specialty hospitals.ConclusionsInpatients who were male, were older, had inferior insurance, had a longer length of stay and had lower costs preferred the elementary health services. However, the utilization of mental health care in high-tier institutions reflected defects, especially the fact that the current health insurance system does not adequately restrict patients' choices, and those who paid more tended to choose tertiary hospitals instead of professional specialty ones. We suggest that psychiatric services should be enhanced by instituting reforms, including public education, improved health insurance, a forceful referral system, and competency reinforcement for primary care physicians, to provide a more integrated mental health system.

AB BackgroundAdolescent sexual risky behaviours continue to be significant drivers of the HIV epidemic globally. The objective of this study was to determine factors associated with prior engagement in high-risk sexual behaviours among adolescents (10-19years) in Karamoja sub-region, a pastoralist and post-conflict community in North-eastern Uganda.MethodsBetween August and September 2016, we conducted a cross-sectional study among 1439 adolescents receiving primary healthcare services at nine public health facilities located in five of the seven districts that make up Karamoja sub-region. High-risk sexual behaviour was defined as engaging in sex with two or more (2+) sexual partners in the 6 months preceding the survey or exchanging sex for money or gifts with no or inconsistent use of condoms over the same period of time. Factors associated with prior engagement in high-risk sexual behaviours were analysed using a modified Poison regression model with log-link and Poisson-family via a generalized linear model.ResultsEighty-two percent (81.8%, n=1177) of the respondents had ever tested for HIV while 62 % (61.5%, n=885) had ever had sex. Of those that had ever had sex, 11.4% (n=101) reported prior engagement in high-risk sexual behaviours. Prior engagement in high-risk sexual behaviours was lower among men than women (adjusted prevalence ratio (adj. PR)=0.46; 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI): 0.33, 0.62) and those whose sex debut was above 14years (adj.PR=0.63; 95% CI: 0.57, 0.69). However, prior engagement in high-risk sexual behaviours was significantly higher in adolescents who were not aware of their recent sexual partner's HIV status (adj.PR=2.43; 95% CI: 1.68, 3.52) and those who used illicit drugs (adj.PR=2.76; 95% CI: 1.88, 4.05).ConclusionPrior engagement in high-risk sexual behaviours was significantly associated with having sex with partners of unknown HIV sero-status and use of illicit drugs. These findings suggest a need for targeted interventions to improve mutual HIV status disclosure between sexual partners while minimizing their use of illicit drugs/substances.

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID IMPACT; INITIATION; CARE
AB Objective
   To compare the survival among patients with chronic kidney disease who had optimal starts of renal replacement therapy, dialysis or hemodialysis, with patients who had suboptimal starts.
   Methods
   A retrospective cohort consisting of > 18 year-old patients who started renal replacement therapy, using peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis, in any public hospital or associated center of the Andalusian Public Health System, between the 1st of January of 2006 and the 15th of March of 2017. The optimal start was defined when all the following criteria were met: a planned dialysis start, a minimum of six-month follow-up by a nephrologist, and a first dialysis method coinciding with the one registered at 90 days. The information was obtained from the registry of the Information System of the Transplant Autonomic Coordination of Andalusia.
   Results
   A total of 10,692 patients were studied. 4,377 (40.9%) of these patients died. A total of 4,937 patients (46.17%) achieved optimal starts of renal replacement therapy and showed higher survival rates (HR 0.669; 95% CI 0.628-0.712) in the multivariate analysis of Cox regression model.
   Conclusions
   Patients with an optimal start of renal replacement therapy have a greater survival than those who had a non-optimal start. Therefore, the necessary measures should be encouraged to increase the optimal start of the patient in dialysis.

AB Whole genome sequencing can provide essential public health information. However, it is now known that widely used short-read methods have the potential to miss some randomly-distributed segments of genomes. This can prevent phages, plasmids, and virulence factors from being detected or properly identified. Here, we compared assemblies of three complete Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O26:H11/H-genomes from two different sequence types (ST21 and 29), each acquired using the Nextera XT MiSeq, MinION nanopore-based sequencing, and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencing. Each closed genome consisted of a single chromosome, approximately 5.7 Mb for CFSAN027343, 5.6 Mb for CFSAN027346, and 5.4 MB for CFSAN027350. However, short-read whole genome sequencing (WGS) using Nextera XT MiSeq failed to identify some virulence genes in plasmids and on the chromosome, both of which were detected using the long-read platforms. Results from long-read MinION and PacBio allowed us to identify differences in plasmid content: a single 88 kb plasmid in CFSAN027343; a 157kb plasmid in CFSAN027350; and two plasmids in CFSAN027346 (one 95 Kb, one 72 Kb). These data enabled rapid characterization of the virulome, detection of antimicrobial genes, and composition/location of Stx phages. Taken together, positive correlations between the two long-read methods for determining plasmids, virulome, antimicrobial resistance genes, and phage composition support MinION sequencing as one accurate and economical option for closing STEC genomes and identifying specific virulence markers.

AB Group A rotaviruses (RVA) are one of the major causes of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in young children worldwide. Owing to lack of proper surveillance programs and health facilities, developing countries of Asia and Africa carry a disproportionately heavy share of the RVA disease burden. The aim of this hospital-based study was to investigate the circulation of RVA genotypes in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, Pakistan in 2015 and 2016, prior to the implementation of RVA vaccine. 639 faecal samples collected from children under 10 years of age hospitalized with AGE were tested for RVA antigen by ELISA. Among 171 ELISA positive samples, 143 were successfully screened for RT-PCR and sequencing. The prevalence of RVA was found to be 26.8% with the highest frequency (34.9%) found among children of age group 6-11 months. The most predominant circulating genotypes were G3P[8] (22.4%) followed by G12P[6] (20.3%), G2P[4] (12.6%), G1P[8] (11.9%), G9P[6] (11.9%), G3P[4] (9.1%), G1P[6] (4.2%), G9P[8] (4.2%), and G3P[6] (0.7%). A single mixed genotype G1G3P[8] was also detected. The findings of this study provide baseline data, that will help to assess if future vaccination campaigns using currently available RVA vaccine will reduce RVA disease burden and instigate evolutionary changes in the overall RVA biology. The high prevalence of RVA infections in Pakistan require to improve and strengthen the surveillance and monitoring system for RVA. This will provide useful information for health authorities in planning public health care strategies to mitigate the disease burden caused by RVA.

Scientists at the meeting underscored the importance of studying the temporal natural history of exposures that may cumulatively impact cancer risk later in life.A robust dialogue identified obesity as a major risk for cancer, and the food environment, especially high energy and low nutrient processed foods, as strong and prevalent risk factors for obesity. Further engagement highlighted challenges in the post-diagnostic setting, where similar opportunities to understand the complex interplay of nutrition, physical activity, and weight will inform better health outcomes.Going forward, holistic research approaches, encompassing insights from multiple disciplines and perspectives, will catalyze progress urgently needed to prevent cancer and improve public health.

AB BackgroundFood-producing animals, mainly poultry, have been associated with the maintenance and dissemination of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as plasmid-mediated AmpC (pAmpC)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, to humans, thus impacting food safety. Many studies have shown that Escherichia coli strains isolated from poultry and humans infections share identical cephalosporin resistance, suggesting that transmission of resistance from poultry meat to humans may occur. The aim of this study was to characterize pAmpC-producing E. coli strains isolated from chicken carcasses and human infection in a restrict area and to determine their antimicrobial resistance profiles, and molecular type by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).ResultsA total of 14 pAmpC-producing E. coli strains were isolated, including eight strains from chicken carcasses and six strains from human infections (from urine, tissue and secretion). The bla(CMY-2) gene was identified in all pAmpC-producing E. coli strains by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. High percentages of strains resistant to tetracycline, nalidixic acid and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (78-92%) were detected, all of which were considered multidrug-resistant. Among the non-beta-lactam resistance genes, the majority of the strains showed tetA, tetB, sulI and sulII. No strain was considered an extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) producer, and the bla(TEM-1) gene was found in 2 strains isolated from human infection. Six strains from chicken carcasses and four strains from humans infections were linked to an ISEcp1-like element. Through MLST, 11 sequence types were found. Three strains isolated from human infection and one strain isolated from chicken carcasses belonged to the same sequence type (ST354). However, considerable heterogeneity between the strains from chicken carcasses and humans was confirmed by PFGE analysis.ConclusionThis study showed the prevalence of E. coli strains producing bla(CMY-2) linked to ISEcp1 that were present in both chickens and humans in a restricted area. Our results also suggest the presence of a highly diverse strains that harbor pAmpC, indicating no clonal dissemination. Therefore, continuous monitoring and comparative analyses of resistant bacteria from humans and food-producing animals are needed.

AB BackgroundRising health spending is associated with high out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE), catastrophic health spending (CHS), increasing poverty, and impoverishment. Though studies have examined poverty and impoverishment effect of health spending in India, there is limited research on the regional patterns of health spending by type of health centers. This paper tests the hypothesis that the poor people from the poorer states of India pay significantly more for hospitalization in public health centers than those in the richer states of India.MethodsData from the Social Consumption of Health Survey (71st round, 2014), carried out by the National Sample Survey (NSS) is used in the analyses. Descriptive statistics, log-linear regression model and tobit model were used to examine the determinants and variations in health spending.ResultsInter-state variations in the utilization of public health services and the OOPE on hospitalization are high in India. States with high levels of poverty make higher use of the public health centers and yet incur high OOPE. In 2014, the mean OOPE per episode of hospitalization in public health centers in India was ?5688 and ?4264 for the economically poor households. It was lowest in the economically developed state of Tamil Nadu and highest in the economically poorer state of Bihar. The OOPE per episode of hospitalization in public health centers among the poor in the poorer states was at least twice that in Tamil Nadu. Among the poor using public health centers, the share of direct cost account 24% in Tamil Nadu compared to over 80% in Bihar, Odisha and other poorer states. Adjusting for socio-economic correlates, the cost of hospitalization per episode (CHPE) among the poor using public health centers was 51% lower than for the non-poor using private health centers in India.ConclusionThe poor people in the poorer states in India pay significantly more to avail hospitalization in public health centers than those in the developed states. Provision of free medicines, surgery and free diagnostic tests in public health centers may reduce the high OOPE and medical poverty in India.

TI The effects of interacting with fish in aquariums on human health and

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Review

   THEORY; PUBLIC AQUARIUMS; MODERATING ROLE; STRESS; DOG; INTERVENTION;
   BENEFITS
AB Background
   Most research into the health benefits of human-animal interaction has focused on species that interact physically with humans, such as dogs. This may be unsuitable for certain populations for reasons including accessibility and the risk of negative consequences to both the person and the animal. However, some research has associated viewing fish in aquariums with positive well-being outcomes; as there is no physical contact with the animal, this form of interaction carries less risk. At present, little is known about the specific benefits of human-fish interaction.
   Objectives
   To explore current evidence relating to the psychological and physiological benefits of interacting with fish in aquariums.
   Methods
   Systematic searches were conducted to identify relevant primary research of any design. All forms of interaction were considered, including keeping fish as companion animals and fish aquarium-based interventions. "Non-live" alternatives, such as videos, were also considered. This review was conducted according to a registered protocol (PROSPERO ID: CRD42018090466).
   Results
   Nineteen studies were included. Two provided tentative evidence that keeping home aquaria is associated with relaxation. The remaining studies involved novel interactions with fish in home or public aquariums. Outcomes relating to anxiety, relaxation and/or physiological stress were commonly assessed; evidence was mixed with both positive and null findings. Preliminary support was found for effects on mood, pain, nutritional intake and body weight, but not loneliness. All studies had methodological issues and risk of bias was either high or unclear.
   Conclusions
   Review findings suggest that interacting with fish in aquariums has the potential to benefit human well-being, although research on this topic is currently limited. Future research should aim to address gaps in the evidence, such as whether and how the type of human-fish interaction can influence well-being outcomes. Researchers should also aim to address the methodological concerns highlighted in this review.

AB Emplaced health promotion interventions, delivered by community health workers are increasingly being used internationally. However, the application of epidemiological risk knowledge to individuals within such communities is not straightforward and creates tensions for community health workers who are part of the communities that they are serving. Situated qualitative interview data were co-produced with community health workers employed in a superdiverse, deprived, post-industrial region of the United Kingdom, using photo-voice methods, to develop an account of how they made sense of the challenges of their work. The analysis draws on and develops theories of risk work and resilience work, which draw on practice theory. The key findings were that, first, being a critical insider enabled community health workers to make sense of the diverse constraints on health and lifestyles within their community. Second, they understood their own public health role as limited by operating within this context, so they articulated their occupational identity as focused on supporting clients to make small but sustainable changes to their own and their families' lifestyles. Third, the uncertainties of translating population based risk information to individual clients were (at least partially) resolved at an embodied level, with the community health workers identifying as accessible and trusted role models for the value of changed lifestyles. The article is important for policy and practice as it provides a critique of a rapidly evolving new mode of delivery of public health services, and insights on the development of this new public health workforce.

TI Health technology reassessment in the Brazilian public health system:
   Analysis of the current status
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID DISINVESTMENT; CARE; BENEFIT; FRANCE
AB Background
   The reassessment of technologies and services offered by healthcare systems is recent initiative and still without a widely adopted and evaluated method. To a better understanding of this process in Brazil, we have described the health technology reassessment (HTR) performed by the National Committee for Health Technology Incorporation (Conitec) into Brazilian public health system (SUS).
   Methods
   A documental, exploratory, descriptive, retrospective study with qualitative-quantitative approach regarding the HTR performed by Conitec from January 2012 to November 2017.
   Results
   After applying the criteria of inclusion and exclusion, we selected 47 technologies for this study. The vast majority of the demands (41 demands) came from the public sector, and only six from the private sector. Most of the requests referred to the exclusion of specific indication; followed by extension of use, withdraw of the technology from SUS, maintenance, and restriction of use. The dimensions of analysis found in the recommendation reports were scientific evidence on efficacy, effectiveness and safety, disease-related issues, issues related to the use of technology, costs, and social participation. However, these dimensions were not included in all analysis, and a standardized structure of the reports has not been observed. The most relevant decision factors considered for decision-making were efficacy, safety and use of the technology.
   Conclusion
   During a six-year period of Conitec actuation, we could find some reassessments of technologies that are available in SUS. We observed that these activities had enabled progress, however, they are still not yet structured, with gaps in the selection process, and the assessment since no methodology and criteria for proper conduct were established.

AB Hepatitis B infection is a world-wide public health burden causing serious liver complications. Previous studies suggest that hepatitis B integration into the human genome plays a crucial role in triggering oncogenic process and may also constitutively produce viral antigens. Despite the progress in HBV biology and sequencing technology, our fundamental understanding of how many hepatocytes in the liver actually carry viral integrations is still lacking. Herein we provide evidence that the HBV virus integrates with a lower-bound frequency of 0.84 per diploid genome in hepatitis B positive hepatocellular cancer patients. Moreover, we calculate that integrated viral DNA generates similar to 80% of the HBsAg transcripts in these patients. These results underscore the need to re-evaluate the clinical end-point and treatment strategies for chronic hepatitis B patients.

AB BackgroundDepression is regarded as a major public health concern in our society. While living arrangements as a structural factor of social support may contribute to older adults' depression. Our study aims to investigate the association between living arrangements and depressive symptoms among older adults in the whole China, and to explore whether such influences differ by genders.MethodsData were obtained from the 2015 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. The sample was comprised of 6001 individuals aged >= 60years. Depressive symptoms were measured by the 10-item Short-Form Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression. Independent variables were divided into 4 groups, considering living with/without a spouse and living with/without a child. The multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the relationship between living arrangements and depressive symptoms in four models.ResultsCompared with living only with a spouse, people living with a spouse and child, or living alone were more likely to have depressive symptoms (odds ratio=1.23 95% CI 1.06-1.42 and 1.40 95% CI 1.03-1.92, respectively). Women were more associated with depressive symptoms (odds ratio=2.13), but there were no significant associations between living arrangements and depressive symptoms among women. Men living with a spouse and a child had stronger positively depressive symptoms (odds ratio=1.37).ConclusionsOlder adults living alone, or living with both a child and spouse were more likely to have depressive symptoms. It is important to provide more social services for those older adult, particularly for men living with a spouse and child.

AB BackgroundCannabis has been identified as a possible risk factor in some tuberculosis (TB) outbreaks. As the most widely used (largely) illegal substance in Western countries this may be an important public health concern. We aim to systematically review the evidence on the association between cannabis use and TB (latent infection and active disease) to inform ongoing and future TB prevention and control strategies.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review. We searched Ovid Medline, Embase and PsycInfo, together with the World Health Organization website and Google Scholar, for all years to January 2018. Reference lists and conference abstracts were hand-searched, a forward citation search was conducted on the Web of Science, and experts were contacted. Two authors independently screened studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias using an adapted version of ROBINS-I (Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions). Data were narratively synthesised.ResultsOf 377 records identified, 11 studies were eligible. Study designs were heterogeneous. Six studies utilised a relevant comparator group. Four of these investigated the association between cannabis use and latent TB infection; all provided some evidence of an association, although only two of these had adjusted for confounders. The remaining two comparator studies investigated the association between cannabis use and active TB disease; neither found evidence of an association after adjusting for confounding. All six studies were at Serious risk of bias. The five studies which did not utilise a relevant comparator group were all indicative of TB outbreaks occurring among cannabis users, but the quality of the evidence was very weak.ConclusionsEvidence for an association between cannabis use and TB acquisition is weak. The topic warrants further robust primary research including the collection of consistent and accurate exposure information, including cannabis use practices, dose and frequency, and adjustment for confounders.

AB BackgroundType 2 diabetes is a major public health problem with considerable personal and societal costs. Adverse childhood experiences (ACE) are associated with a number of serious and chronic health problems in adulthood, but these experiences have not been adequately studied in relation to diabetes in a US national sample. The association between ACE and poor health can be partially explained by greater risky health behaviors (RHB) such as smoking, heavy alcohol use, or obesity. Few studies have examined ACE in relation to adult onset Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) taking into account the role of RHB. Using longitudinal data from a representative US population sample followed over 30years, this study examines the impact of ACE on the risk of diabetes onset.MethodsData from the 1982 to 2012 waves of the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth were analyzed, spanning ages 14 to 56. Bivariate and discrete-time survival models were used to assess the relationships between ACE and RHB including smoking, alcohol use, and obesity, and subsequent onset of diabetes.ResultsT2DM was reported by almost 10% of participants. Over 30% of women and 21% of men reported 2+ ACE events. Women reporting 2-3 or 4+ ACE events were more likely to develop diabetes with the mean number of ACE events being greater in those with diabetes compared to without (1.28 vs.1.05, p<.0001). For men there was no significant association between ACE and diabetes onset. For women, ACE was associated with heavy drinking, current smoking, and obesity. For men, ACE was associated with being underweight and daily smoking. In multivariate discrete-time survival models, each additional ACE increased risk of T2DM onset (ORadj=1.14; 95% CI 1.02-1.26) for women but not for men. The relationship in women was attenuated when controlling for body mass index (BMI).ConclusionACE predicted diabetes onset among women, though this relationship was attenuated when controlling for BMI. Being overweight or obese was significantly more common among women with a history of ACE, which suggests BMI may be on the pathway from ACE to diabetes onset for women.

AB Objectives
   To provide baseline information on inappropriate prescribing (IP), and to evaluate whether potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs), as defined by STOPP (Screening Tool of Older Persons' potentially inappropriate Prescriptions) criteria, were associated with preventable adverse drug events (ADEs) and/or hospitalization.
   Methods
   We prospectively studied older patients (n = 301) admitted to three urban, public-funded hospitals. We scrutinized their medical records and used STOPP-START (Screening Tool to Alert Prescribers to Right Treatment) criteria to determine PIM and potential prescribing omissions (PPO) respectively-together these constitute IP. Prescriptions with PIM(s) were subjected to a pharmacist medication review, aimed at detecting cases of ADE(s). The vetted cases were further assessed by an expert consensus panel to ascertain: i) causality between the ADE and hospitalization, using, the World Health Organization Uppsala Monitoring Centre criteria, and, ii) whether the ADEs were avoidable (using Hallas criteria). Finally, percentages of PIM-associated ADEs that were both preventable and linked to hospitalization were calculated.
   Results
   IP prevalence was 58.5% (n = 176). A majority (49.5%, n = 150) had moderate to severe degree of comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index score >= 3). Median age was 72 years. Median number of medications was 6 and 30.9% (n = 93) had >= 8 medications. PIM prevalence was 34.9% (117 PIMs, n = 105) and PPO 37.9% (191 PPOs, n = 114). Most PIMs and PPOs involved overuse of aspirin and underuse of both antiplatelets and statins respectively. With every increase in the number of medications prescribed, the likelihood of PIM occurrence increased by 20%, i.e. 1.2 fold (OR 1.20, 95% CI: 1.1-1.3). Among the 105 patients with PIMs, 33 ADEs (n = 33); 31 ADEs (n = 31) considered "causal" or "contributory" to hospitalization; 27 ADEs (n = 27) deemed "avoidable" or "potentially avoidable"; and 25 PIM-associated ADEs, preventable, and that induced hospitalization (n = 25), were identified: these equated to prevalence of 31.4%, 29.5%, 25.7%, and 23.8% respectively. The most common ADEs were masked hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal bleed. With every additional PIM prescribed, the odds for ADE occurrence increased by 12 folds (OR 11.8, 95% CI 5.20-25.3).
   Conclusion
   The majority of the older patients who were admitted to secondary care for acute illnesses were potentially exposed to IP. Approximately a quarter of the patients were prescribed with PIMs, which were plausibly linked with preventable ADEs that directly caused or contributed to hospitalization.

TI Association of metabolic syndrome with the incidence of hearing loss: A

DT Article
ID CARDIOVASCULAR RISK-FACTORS; NITRIC-OXIDE; DYSFUNCTION
AB Background & aims
   Sensorineural hearing loss (HL) is one of the most common public health problems, and its prevalence increases with increasing life expectancy. An association between HL and metabolic syndrome (MetS) is suspected. Although previous epidemiological studies have investigated the association between the two variables, there have been conflicting conclusions. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the association between the presence of MetS-and individual components of MetS-and HL, using a longitudinal design and a large-scale population.
   Methods
   A total of 17,513,555 individuals who underwent national health screening between January 2009 and December 2010 were identified. Subject data from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service were reviewed. A total of 11,457,931 subjects were ultimately included in the analysis. Baseline comorbidities were defined according to the ICD-10 code from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service data. If the participants had an ICD-10 code for HL during the follow-up, they were defined as having incident HL. Criteria for MetS adhered to the revised National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III.
   Results
   There were 7,574,432 subjects without MetS and 3,883,499 with MetS. The incidence of HL in subjects without MetS and with MetS was 1.3% and 1.8% at 1 year, 4.1% and 5.2% at 3 years, and 6.8% and 8.6% at 5 years, respectively (P < 0.001). However, multivariate analyses revealed a negative association. Analyses according to the components of MetS demonstrated a positive association for those associated with dyslipidemia; however, the others exhibited an inverse association with HL. We also performed analyses using 4 groups according to the presence of MetS and the components of dyslipidemia. Univariate analysis revealed a positive association between the presence of MetS and HL; however, multivariate analysis revealed a positive association between the presence of dyslipidemia components and HL, regardless of the presence of MetS.
   Conclusion
   Among the components of MetS, the association between low HDL or high TG levels and HL was most apparent. It is useful to evaluate each MetS component in isolation, such as the presence of low HDL or high TG levels, rather than the presence of MetS as a cluster of components.

TI Investigation of multi-scale spatio-temporal pattern of oldest-old
   clusters in China on the basis of spatial scan statistics
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH; LONGEVITY; CENTENARIANS; ENVIRONMENTS; INDICATORS; DISEASE
AB Background
   Ageing is becoming a considerable public health burden in China, which produces great societal development challenges. Healthy and active longevity could ease the ageing burden on families and communities. To date, most studies of the oldest-old distribution are focused on a simple scale from spatial perspective, and the multi-scale spatio-temporal clusters trend in the oldest-old population has not yet been determined. Thus, the objective in present study is to use a new method to evaluate the spatio-temporal pattern and detect the risk clusters in the oldest-old population from three scales.
   Methods
   Individuals aged 65 years or older and individuals aged 80 years or older on three scales in China from 2000 to 2010 were used. The exploratory spatial data analysis was performed using Moran's I statistic, and the pattern of the oldest-old clusters among humans was examined by using the spatial scan statistical method. Then, spatial stratified heterogeneity was used to explore the factors affecting the spatial heterogeneity of the oldest-old population.
   Results
   The oldest-old index in the southeast coastal areas is higher than that in the northwest inland areas in China. A three-ladder terrain distribution of the oldest-old index from west to east is obvious. The overall pattern of the oldest-old index evolves from a "concave" shape to an "east-west uplift, and northern collapse" shape. Space-time analysis revealed that high-risk areas were concentrated in five regions: the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, the Southeast Coast, Sichuan and Chongqing, and the Central Plains. The oldest-old cluster at different scales shows a similar pattern, but local differences exist. The risk at the prefecture scale and county scale is greater than at the interprovincial scale; the sublevel can identify clusters that have not been identified at the previous level, especially the bordering areas of prefectures and counties; and more risk units and greater relative risk are found in urban areas than in rural areas.
   Conclusions
   The results emphasized that spatial scan statistics can be used to estimate the spatial clusters of the oldest-old people. The detection of these clusters might be highly useful in the surveillance of the ageing phenomenon, thus helping local public health authorities measure the population burden at all locations, identifying geographical areas that require more attention, and evaluating the impacts of intervention programs.

AB Maintaining physical activity is necessary to promote health in our daily lives. The Ecological Model of Active Living was proposed to examine whether individuals participate in active living. The purpose of this study was to understand the determinants of physical activity and create a predictive path model of the intrapersonal, perceived environment, behavior settings, and policy environment domains. Data were obtained from open government data and questionnaires, including the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Health Belief Model Inventory, Physical Activity Neighborhood Environment Survey, and Accessibility of Open Spaces. Participants comprised 1085 healthy adults who completed a self-reported internet survey. An analysis of the intrapersonal domain revealed that the variables of female, an older age, and a low educational level, and individuals with obesity or cardiometabolic diseases presented lower odds ratios for active living. We found significant statistical support for our path model (The Ecological Model of Active Living), with a predictive power of 23.1%. The predictive path model is a good approach to quantitatively measure the impacts of various determinants on active living that suggests further lines of research in approaches for modeling relationships.

AB BackgroundEducation and health are crucial topics for public policies as both largely determine the future wellbeing of the society. Currently, several studies recognize that physical activity (PA) benefits brain health in children. However, most of these studies have not been carried out in developing countries or lack the transference into the education field. The Cogni-Action Project is divided into two stages, a cross-sectional study and a crossover-randomized trial. The aim of the first part is to establish the associations of PA, sedentarism, and physical fitness with brain structure and function, cognitive performance and academic achievement in Chilean schoolchildren (10-13years-old). The aim of the second part is to determinate the acute effects of three PA protocols on neuroelectric indices during a working memory and a reading task.MethodsPA and sedentarism will be self-reported and objectively-assessed with accelerometers in a representative subsample, whilst physical fitness will be evaluated through the ALPHA fitness test battery. Brain structure and function will be assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a randomized subsample. Cognitive performance will be assessed through the NeuroCognitive Performance Test, and academic achievement by school grades. In the second part 32 adolescents (12-13year-old) will be cross-over randomized to these condition (i) Moderate-Intensity Continuous Training (MICT), (ii) Cooperative High-Intensity Interval Training (C-HIIT), and (iii) Sedentary condition. Neuroelectric indices will be measures by electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye-tracking, working memory by n-back task and reading comprehension by a reading task.DiscussionThe main strength of this project is that, to our knowledge, this is the first study analysing the potential association of PA, sedentarism, and physical fitness on brain structure and function, cognitive performance, and academic achievement in a developing country, which presents an important sociocultural gap. For this purpose, this project will use advanced technologies in neuroimaging (MRI), electrophysiology (EEG), and eye-tracking, as well as objective and quality measurements of several physical and cognitive health outcomes.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03894241 Date of register: March 28, 2019.

AB BackgroundEgypt has seen substantial decreases in maternal mortality and reached near universal coverage for antenatal care (ANC). The objective of this paper is to describe the changes over time (1991-2014) in the use of ANC in Egypt, focusing on sector of provision (public versus private), and the content and equity of this care, to inform future policies for improving maternal and newborn health.MethodsWe used Demographic and Health surveys (DHS) conducted in Egypt in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2008 and 2014 to explore national and regional trends in ANC. To assess content of care, we calculated the percentage of ANC users who reported receiving seven ANC components measured in DHS in 2014.ResultsDuring the period under consideration, the percentage of women in need of ANC who received facility-based ANC increased from 42 to 90%, the majority of which was private-sector ANC. The mean number of ANC visits among ANC users increased over time from 7.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]=7.1-7.9) in 1991-1995 to 9.7 (95%CI 9.6-9.9) in 2010-2014. In 2010-2014, 44% of women using public ANC reported eight or more visits compared to 71% in private ANC. In the same period, 24% of ANC users received all seven care components. This percentage ranged from 10% of women reporting fewer than four ANC visits to 29% of women reporting eight or more. The poorest ANC users received all seven measured components of care less often than the wealthiest (20% versus 28%, p-value<0.001).ConclusionsEgypt's improvements in ANC coverage were characterized by decreasing reliance on public services and a rising number of ANC visits. However, despite rising ANC coverage, less than a third of women received the seven essential ANC components measured at least once during pregnancy, with differences between poorer and wealthier women. Policymakers need to ensure that high ANC coverage translates into equity-focused interventions targeting ANC quality. Further research needs to support this effort by assessing the determinants behind poor quality of ANC and evaluating potential interventions.

AB BackgroundImproved understanding of vegetable intake changes between pregnancy and postpartum may inform future intervention targets to establish healthy home food environments. Therefore, the goal of this study was to explore the changes in vegetable intake between pregnancy and the postnatal period and explore maternal and sociodemographic factors that are associated with these changes.MethodsWe examined sociodemographic, dietary, and health characteristics of healthy mothers 18-43y from the prospective Infant Feeding Practices II cohort (n=847) (2005-2012). Mothers completed a modified version of the diet history questionnaire, a food-frequency measure, developed by the National Cancer Institute. We created four categories of mothers, those that were: meeting vegetablerecommendations post- but not prenatally (n=121; improved intake), not meeting vegetable recommendations during pregnancy and postnatally (n=370; stable inadequate), meeting recommendations pre- but not postnatally (n=123; reduced intake), and meeting recommendations at both time points (n=233; stable adequate). To make our results more relevant to public health recommendations, we were interested in comparing the improved vegetable intake group vs. stable inadequate vegetable intake group, as well as those that reduced their vegetable intake compared to the stable adequate vegetable intake group. Separate multivariable-adjusted logistic regression were used to examine sociodemographic predictors of improved vs. stable inadequate and reduced vs. stable adequate vegetable intake.ResultsWomen with improved vegetable intake vs. stable inadequate smoked fewercigarettes while women with reduced vegetable intake vs. stable adequate were more likely to experience less pregnancy weight gain. In adjusted models, employed women had greater odds of reduced vegetable intake (OR=1.64 95% CI 1.14-2.36). In exploratory analyses, employment was associated with greater odds of reduced vegetable intake among low-income (OR=1.79; 95% CI 1.03-3.1), but not higher income women (OR=1.31; 95% CI 0.94-1.84). After further adjustment for paid maternity leave, employment was no longer associated with vegetable intake among lower income women (OR: 1.53; 95% CI: 0.76-3.05).ConclusionsMore women with reduced vs. stable adequate vegetable intake were lower income and worked full time. Improved access to paid maternity leave may help reduce disparities in vegetable quality between lower and higher income women.

AB BackgroundThis study explored primary healthcare provider and HIV/contraception expert stakeholder perspectives on South Africa's public sector provision of contraceptive implants to women living with HIV. We investigated the contraceptive service-impact of official advice against provision of implants to women using the HIV antiretroviral drug, efavirenz, issued by the South African National Department of Health (NDoH) in 2014.MethodsQualitative data was collected in Cape Town in 2017 from primary healthcare contraceptive providers in four clinics that provide implants, as well as from other expert stakeholders selected for expertise in HIV and/or contraception. In-depth interviews and a group discussion explored South Africa's implant introduction and implant provision to women living with HIV. Data was analysed using an inductive thematic analysis approach.ResultsInterviews were conducted with 10 providers and 10 stakeholders. None of the four clinics where the providers worked currently offered the implant to women living with HIV. Stakeholders confirmed that this was consistent with patterns of implant provision at primary healthcare facilities across Cape Town. Factors contributing to providers' decisions to suspend provision of the implant to women living with HIV included: inadequate initial and ongoing provider training; interpretation of NDoH communications about implant use with efavirenz; provider unwillingness to risk harming clients and concerns about professional liability; and other pressures related to provider capacity.ConclusionsAll South African women, including those living with HIV, should have access to the full range of contraceptive options for which they are medically eligible. Changing guidance should be initiated and communicated in consultation with primary-level providers and service beneficiaries. Guidance issued to providers needs to be clear and fully evidence-informed, and its correct interpretation and implementation facilitated and monitored. Guidance should be accompanied by provider training, as well as counselling messages and tools to support providers. Generalized retraining of providers in rights-based, client-centred family planning, and in particular implant provision for women with HIV, is needed. These recommendations accord with the right of women living with HIV to access the highest possible standard of sexual and reproductive healthcare, including informed contraceptive choice and access to the contraceptive implant.

AB BackgroundChronic hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection affects 80-100 million people in sub-Saharan Africa and accounts for an estimated 650,000 deaths annually. The prevalence of active hepatitis B virus infection among women aged 15-64 in mid-Northern Uganda is about 5%. Lira district is among the high prevalence areas where government embarked on mass HBV screening since 2015 as a gateway for access to prevention, treatment services, and an effective response to the hepatitisB epidemic. The current proportion of pregnant women screened and the factors associated with prenatal HBVscreening in Lira are not known despite the fact that women contribute largely to both vertical and horizontal transmission of HBV. This study aimed at determining the proportion of pregnant women screened for HBV and factors associated with prenatal HBV screening in Lira district.MethodsThis was a community based cross sectional study conducted among 423 pregnant women in the sub counties of Aromo and Agweng in Lira district. Data were collected using open data kit and analysed using STATA version 14. The outcome variable was prenatal HBV screening while predictor variables were community, individual and health facility factors associated with HBV screening. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with prenatal HBV screening.ResultsThirty five women (8.3%) had been screened for HBV during the current pregnancy. Factors associated with prenatal HBV screening in Lira included perceived risk (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 3.78, 95% CI 1.01-6.14), respondent's age (AOR=3.98, 95% CI 1.39-5.09), husband/partner's education (AOR=3.34, 95% CI 1.10-5.12) and past failure to access to HBV screening services at government health facilities (AOR=6.44, 95% CI 2.10-8.02).ConclusionThe level of HBV screening among pregnant women in Lira was low and is mainly associated with perceived risk, age, access to HBV screening services and spousal education level. More effort is needed in creating mass awareness on the need and importance of HBV screening most especially among pregnant women.

AB BackgroundOrganized, leisure time physical activities are an important part of a population approach to increase total physical activity participation. Dancing is a type of organized leisure time activity which may be utilized to enhance public health. Individuals commonly participate in dance during childhood however few maintain participation into adulthood, dropping out of the activity while young. This study aimed to investigate who participates in an emerging dance activity, No Lights, No Lycra, which encourages people to participate in free-form dancing in the dark for 60min designed as an inclusive, nonjudgmental, drug and alcohol-free community setting. This version of dance provides a modified opportunity for organized leisure time physical activity. No Lights, No Lycra has recorded increases in attendance at their events over the past decade. This popularity warrants an investigation into participant's demographic characteristics, their total physical activity, as well as their motivations for dancing in the dark and any impacts on health and wellbeing.MethodsThis study invited No Lights, No Lycra participants from across Australia to complete a cross-sectional, self-report online survey. Participants were recruited while attending an organized session or through social media channels. The descriptive data provided through survey responses were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics.ResultsParticipants (n=1190, 92% Female) reported their main reason for dancing in the dark was to have fun. Most participants were insufficiently active, with 88% of responders not meeting physical activity guidelines. The No Lights, No Lycra dance sessions contributed 23% of their total annual participation in organized physical activities.ConclusionNo Lights, No Lycra attracts adult women, rather than the typical dance participants - children; These women did not meet physical activity guidelines and typically had low levels of engagement in organized physical activity. Participation in No Lights, No Lycra, shows promise to increase women's physical activity. This study into No Lights, No Lycra demonstrates how dance can be modified to engage a relatively inactive portion of the community. More should be done to understand how modifications to organized sport and physical activities can motivate and maintain engagement of typically inactive people.

AB BackgroundMothers with infants and toddlers are a potential target population for the prevention or alleviation of feelings of loneliness. However, the theory and methods for measuring loneliness among mothers with infants and toddlers have yet to be standardized worldwide, including in Japan. Our goal was to evaluate the reliability and validity of the Japanese version of the UCLA Loneliness Scale Version 3 (UCLA-LS3-J), as well as two short-form versions-the 10-item UCLA-LS3 (SF-10) and the 3-item UCLA-LS3 (SF-3)-for the measurement of loneliness in mothers with infants and toddlers in Japan.MethodsThis cross-sectional study was conducted using a self-report questionnaire. The target population was 430 mothers with infants and toddlers who visited a community health center in Yokohama City in Japan. Questionnaire items encompassed the UCLA-LS3-J, as well as demographic data, the feeling for childrearing scale, and measures of social networks and subjective health status. The reliability and validity of the UCLA-LS3-J and its two short-form versions (SF-3 and SF-10) were determined via IBM SPSS Amos and SPSS Statistics 22.ResultsQuestionnaires were returned by 248 mothers (valid response rate: 57.7%) aged 32.74.6 (mean +/- SD) years. The mean score on the UCLA-LS3-J was 38.4 +/- 9.7 (range 20.0-73.0), with a normal distribution. When confirmatory factor analysis was carried out (for a single factor model), the goodness of fit of the model was almost identical to that of the original UCLA-LS3 version for the UCLA-LS3-J: (GFI=0.882, AGFI=0.840, CFI=0.932, RMSEA=0.066) and SF-10: (GFI=0.942, AGFI=0.900, CFI=0.956, RMSEA=0.081). The SF-3 model also showed an acceptable fit. The UCLA-LS3-J total score was significantly correlated with the total score on the SF-10 (r=0.965) and SF-3 (r=0.868). The Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the UCLA-LS3-J was 0.926, while those of the SF-10 and SF-3 were 0.888 and 0.790, respectively. The score on the UCLA-LS3-J was positively correlated with childcare burden (r=.319, p<0.001) and negatively correlated with social networks (r=-.438, p<0.001).Conclusions This study indicated that the reliability and validity of the UCLA-LS3-J as well as its two short-form versions were adequate for assessing loneliness in mothers with infants and toddlers in Japan.

AB Background
   Considerable upscaling of malaria control efforts have taken place over the last 15 years in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the country with the second highest malaria case load after Nigeria. Malaria control interventions have been strengthened in line with the Millenium Development Goals. We analysed the effects of these interventions on malaria cases at health facility level, using a retrospective trend analysis of malaria cases between 2005 and 2014. Data were collected from outpatient and laboratory registers based on a sample of 175 health facilities that represents all eco-epidemiological malaria settings across the country.
   Methods
   We applied a time series analysis to assess trends of suspected and confirmed malaria cases, by health province and for different age groups. A linear panel regression model controlled for non-malaria outpatient cases, rain fall, nightlight intensity, health province and time fixed effects, was used to examine the relationship between the interventions and malaria case occurrences, as well as test positivity rates.
   Results
   Overall, recorded suspected and confirmed malaria cases in the DRC have increased. The sharp increase in confirmed cases from 2010 coincides with the introduction of the new treatment policy and the resulting scale-up of diagnostic testing. Controlling for confounding factors, the introduction of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) was significantly associated with the number of tested and confirmed cases. The test positivity rate fluctuated around 40% without showing any trend.
   Conclusion
   The sharp increase in confirmed malaria cases from 2010 is unlikely to be due to a resurgence of malaria, but is clearly associated with improved diagnostic availability, mainly the introduction of RDTs. Before that, a great part of malaria cases were treated based on clinical suspicion. This finding points to a better detection of cases that potentially contributed to improved case management. Furthermore, the expansion of diagnostic testing along with the increase in confirmed cases implies that before 2010, cases were underreported, and that the accuracy of routine data to describe malaria incidence has improved.

   CHILDREN; ILLNESS; DISEASE; FEVER
AB Severe-febrile-illness (SFI) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The burden of SFI in SSA is currently unknown and its estimation is fraught with challenges. This is due to a lack of diagnostic capacity for SFI in SSA, and thus a dearth of baseline data on the underlying etiology of SFI cases and scant SFI-specific causativeagent prevalence data. To highlight the public health significance of SFI in SSA, we developed a Bayesian model to quantify the incidence of SFI hospital admissions in SSA. Our estimates indicate a mean population-weighted SFI-inpatient-admission incidence rate of 18.4 (6.8-31.1, 68% CrI) per 1000 people for the year 2014, across all ages within areas of SSA with stable Plasmodium falciparum transmission. We further estimated a total of 16,200,337 (5,993,249-27,321,779, 68% CrI) SFI hospital admissions. This analysis reveals the significant burden of SFI in hospitals in SSA, but also highlights the paucity of pathogen-specific prevalence and incidence data for SFI in SSA. Future improvements in pathogen-specific diagnostics for causative agents of SFI will increase the abundance of SFI-specific prevalence and incidence data, aid future estimations of SFI burden, and enable clinicians to identify SFI-specific pathogens, administer appropriate treatment and management, and facilitate appropriate antibiotic use.

DE Global health; Ethics; Critical interpretive review
ID BIOETHICS; REVIEWS
AB BackgroundThe field of bioethics has evolved over the past half-century, incorporating new domains of inquiry that signal developments in health research, clinical practice, public health in its broadest sense and more recently sensitivity to the interdependence of global health and the environment. These extensions of the reach of bioethics are a welcome response to the growth of global health as a field of vital interest and activity.MethodsThis paper provides a critical interpretive review of how the term global health ethics has been used and defined in the literature to date to identify ethical issues that arise and need to be addressed when deliberating on and working to improve the discourse on ethical issues in health globally.ResultsSelected publications were analyzed by year of publication and geographical distribution, journal and field, level of engagement, and ethical framework. Of the literature selected, 151 articles (88%) were written by authors in high-income countries (HIC), as defined by the World Bank country classifications, 8 articles (5%) were written by authors in low- or middle-income countries (LMIC), and 13 articles (7%) were collaborations between authors in HIC and LMIC. All of the articles selected except one from 1977 were published after 1998. Literature on global health ethics spiked considerably from the early 2000s, with the highest number in 2011. One hundred twenty-seven articles identified were published in academic journals, 1 document was an official training document, and 44 were chapters in published books. The dominant journals were the American Journal of Bioethics (n=10), Developing World Bioethics (n=9), and Bioethics (n=7). We coded the articles by level of engagement within the ethical domain at different levels: (1) interpersonal, (2) institutional, (3) international, and (4) structural. The ethical frameworks at use corresponded to four functional categories: those examining practical or narrowly applied ethical questions; those concerned with normative ethics; those examining an issue through a single philosophical tradition; and those comparing and contrasting insights from multiple ethical frameworks.ConclusionsThis critical interpretive review is intended to delineate the current contours and revitalize the conversation around the future charge of global health ethics scholarship.

AB BackgroundUsage of structured fields in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to ascertain smoking history is important but fails in capturing the nuances of smoking behaviors. Knowledge of smoking behaviors, such as pack year history and most recent cessation date, allows care providers to select the best care plan for patients at risk of smoking attributable diseases.MethodsWe developed and evaluated a health informatics pipeline for identifying complete smoking history from clinical notes in EHRs. We utilized 758 patient-visit notes (from visits between 03/28/2016 and 04/04/2016) from our local EHR in addition to a public dataset of 502 clinical notes from the 2006 i2b2 Challenge to assess the performance of this pipeline. We used a machine-learning classifier to extract smoking status and a comprehensive set of text processing regular expressions to extract pack years and cessation date information from these clinical notes.ResultsWe identified smoking status with an F1 score of 0.90 on both the i2b2 and local data sets. Regular expression identification of pack year history in the local test set was 91.7% sensitive and 95.2% specific, but due to variable context the pack year extraction was incomplete in 25% of cases, extracting packs per day or years smoked only. Regular expression identification of cessation date was 63.2% sensitive and 94.6% specific.ConclusionsOur work indicates that the development of an EHR-based Smokers' Registry containing information relating to smoking behaviors, not just status, from free-text clinical notes using an informatics pipeline is feasible. This pipeline is capable of functioning in external EHRs, reducing the amount of time and money needed at the institute-level to create a Smokers' Registry for improved identification of patient risk and eligibility for preventative and early detection services.

AB BackgroundThe Syrian crisis has started eight years ago and has, directly and indirectly, affected all the aspects of the Syrians lives. A lot of new war-related factors contributed to change the socio-economic status, the demographical distribution and the ability to access the public health services. Moreover, the crisis created the biggest displacement crisis both inside and outside Syria. Therefore, it is important to study the prevalence of dental caries and oral health in these specific circumstances in order to build a database to assess and compare future results of preventive programs and to assess health and social needs of the communities affected by war or crisis. The aim of this research is to Study the level of oral health among children during the Syrian crisis, as well as the relation between oral health and socioeconomic status (SES).MethodsA cross-sectional study to assess the oral health of children in Damascus city by using DMFT index and other dental indices. The data were collected from ten randomly selected schools covering all the areas of Damascus city, and the final sample size was 811 children.ResultsDMFT index was used to assess the oral health of the children. The average number was (3.36) among all children; 14% of the sample size had a good oral health, while 86% had at least one decayed, missed, or filled tooth. There was also a strong association between SES of the child and the oral health represented as DMFT Index (P=0.03), Pearson's correlation test displayed an inverse association between the SES and oral health (P=-0.074).ConclusionThis study highlights the impact of the Syrian crisis on the SES of the Syrian children and their oral health. Bad oral health has been recorded and it has a significant relation with the SES of the children.

AB BackgroundThe current demographic trends indicate that breast cancer will pose an even greater public health concern in future for Pakistan. Details on the incidence, disease severity and mortality in respect of breast cancer are limited and without such data, therefore, future health policies or systems in respect of this disease cannot be strategically planned or implemented. The aim of this study was to examine past trends of age-specific breast cancer incidence rates (2004-2015), and to estimate the future volume of breast cancer cases in Karachi through the year 2025.MethodsTwo statistical methods, namely the functional time series models and the log-linear regression model were used; additionally, their real forecasting efficacy in epidemic time series was also evaluated.ResultsIn the past, women aged 60-64years had the highest overall breast cancer incidence rates, while from 2016 to 2025, large increases in breast cancer rates among women aged 50 to 64years are expected. The total projected breast cancer incidence will increase by approximately 23.1% in 2020 to 60.7% in 2025. Cases of breast cancer diagnosed in younger women, aged 30-34years, will increase from 70.7 to 130.6% in 2020 and 2025 relative to 2015.ConclusionsThe breast cancer incidence appeared to have been rising more rapidly among post-menopausal women (aged 55 to 59), while a stable increase in incidence in the youngest age group (15-29years) of women is expected. The results also infer an expected increase in incidence cases of breast cancer among middle aged women in Karachi, Pakistan. An increase in the number of incident cases of cancer has implications for understanding the health-care needs of growing population and the subsequent demands on health-care system.

TI Patient participation and learning in medical consultations about
   congenital heart defects
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PUBLIC-HEALTH; COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION; DIAGNOSIS
AB In this article, patient activity in 8 audio recorded specialist consultations on fetal cardiology is investigated in order to explore how, why and when patients tend to participate in encounters in which the doctor dominates the interaction. The overall question is: How can the participation of patients in the consultations be connected to the development of higher levels of health literacy, i.e. to interactive literacy and to critical literacy? Patient participation is here understood as interactive action and is analyzed in terms of different interactive moves, which are related to different recurring topics. Despite the highly standardized format of the consultations, there is a large variation between the patients' participation: between 0.7 and 2.8 moves per minute. The patients participate most during the topics 'Prevalence' and 'Consultations' and least during the topic The normal heart'. Although most of the patients' moves are responses to what the doctor says, they remarkably often pose questions and use so called rejoinders. By posing questions, they take control of the information flow and sometimes even change the topics. By using rejoinders, they analyze the problems involved in the discussion e.g. by asking for clarifications or confirmation. Patients with a low over-all participation rate also use fewer moves that indicate higher literacy levels. The qualitative analysis problematizes the idea of a simple scale from basic literacy to critical literacy. Moves that indicate basic literacy skills are interactively important for the learning activity, led by the doctor. However, patients who mainly support the doctor's initiatives don't take the opportunity to influence the flow of information in ways that might favor their health literacy development.

ID EXTRA-PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; EXTRAPULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; DETERMINANTS
AB Background
   Tuberculosis (TB) is a public health problem worldwide. Characterizing its trends over time is a useful tool for decision-makers to assess the efficiency of TB control programs. We aimed to give an update on the current chronological trends of TB in Southern Tunisia from 1995 to 2016 and to estimate future trajectories of TB epidemic by 2030.
   Methods
   We retrospectively collected data of all notified TB new cases by the Center of Tuberculosis Control between 1995 and 2016 in South of Tunisia. Joinpoint Regression Analysis was performed to analyze chronological trends and annual percentage changes (APC) were estimated.
   Results
   In the past 22 years, a total of 2771 cases of TB were notified in Southern Tunisia. The annual incidence rate of TB was 13.91/100,000 population/year. There was a rise in all forms of TB incidence (APC = 1.63) and in extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) (APC = 2.04). The incidence of TB increased in children and adult females between 1995 and 2016 (APC = 4.48 and 2.37, respectively). The annual number of TB declined in urban districts between 2004 and 2016 (APC = -2.85). Lymph node TB cases increased (APC = 4.58), while annual number of urogenital TB decreased between 1995 and 2016 (APC = -3.38). Projected incidence rates would increase to 18.13 and 11.8/100,000 population in 2030 for global TB and EPTB, respectively.
   Conclusions
   Our study highlighted a rise in all forms of TB and among high-risk groups, notably children, females and lymph node TB patients in the last two decades and up to the next one.

AB Pathogen monitoring, detection and removal are essential to public health and outbreak management. Systems are in place for monitoring the microbial load of hospitals and public health facilities with strategies to mitigate pathogen spread. However, no such strategies are in place for ambulances, which are tasked with transporting at-risk individuals in immunocompromised states. As standard culturing techniques require a laboratory setting, and are time consuming and labour intensive, our approach was designed to be portable, inexpensive and easy to use based on the MinION third-generation sequencing platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. We developed a transferable sampling-to-analysis pipeline to characterize the microbial community in emergency medical service vehicles. Our approach identified over sixty-eight organisms in ambulances to the genera level, with a proportion of these being connected with health-care associated infections, such as Clostridium spp. and Staphylococcus spp. We also monitored the microbiome of different locations across three ambulances over time, and examined the dynamic community of microorganisms found in emergency medical service vehicles. Observed differences identified hot spots, which may require heightened monitoring and extensive cleaning. Through metagenomics analysis it is also possible to identify how microorganisms spread between patients and colonize an ambulance over time. The sequencing results aid in the development of practices to mitigate disease spread, while also providing a useful tool for outbreak prediction through ongoing analysis of the ambulance microbiome to identify new and emerging pathogens. Overall, this pipeline allows for the tracking and monitoring of pathogenic microorganisms of epidemiological interest, including those related to health-care associated infections.

   EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB The trade in live animals and animal products is considered one of the major drivers of zoonotic disease emergence. Schiphol airport in the Netherlands is one of the largest European airports and is considered a main hub for legal and illegal import of exotic animals. However, so far there is little information about what pathogens these imported animals might carry with them. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the zoonotic risks of exotic animals imported into the Netherlands through Schiphol airport in 2013 and 2014. Based on a previous list of highly prioritised emerging zoonoses for the Netherlands (EmZoo list), WAHID and Promed databases, literature and expert opinions, a list of 143 potentially relevant zoonotic pathogens was compiled. In a step-wise selection process eighteen pathogen-host combinations that may pose a public health risk by the import of exotic animals via Schiphol airport were identified and these were assessed by expert elicitation. The five pathogens with the highest combined scores were Salmonella spp., Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, West Nile virus, Yersinia pestis and arenaviruses, but overall, the public health risk of the introduction of these exotic pathogens into the Netherlands via the legal import of exotic animals was considered low. However, the vast majority of imported exotic animals were imported by trade companies, increasing the risk for specific groups such as retail and hobbyists/pet owners. It is expected that the risk of introduction of exotic zoonotic pathogens via illegal import is substantial due to the unknown health status. Due to changing trade patterns combined with changing epidemiological situation in the world and changing epidemiological features of pathogens, this risk assessment needs regular updating. The results could give directions for further adjusting of health requirements and risk based additional testing of imported exotic animals.

DE Hypothermia; Thermo-regulation; Thermal care; Haramaya University
AB BackgroundNeonatal hypothermia plays a significant role in increasing neonatal death by 80% for every 1 degree Celsius decrease of body temperature, especially in sub Saharan countries. A global burden of neonatal hypothermia indicated that 53% of Ethiopian newborns developed hypothermia due to different socio-demographic, behavioral, physiological and birth context related factors. However, the significance of these factors along the spectrum of public health institutions in the study area hasn't been yet studied.ObjectiveTo assess the prevalence and associated factors of neonatal hypothermia within six hours of delivery at public health institutions of Harar city, Eastern Ethiopia, 2018.MethodsAn institution based cross sectional study was conducted at Harar city after stratified followed by random selection of 3 public health institutions. Every other eligible newborn was included by systematic sampling to yield a sample of 403 newborns and their axillary temperature was measured by a calibrated digital thermometer within six hours of delivery from January 25 to February 19, 2018. A pre-tested anonymous questionnaire and checklist were used. The collected data were cleaned, coded and entered into Epi -data version 4.2 and exported to STATA version 12. Binary logistic regression model was considered and those variables with P<0.25 in the bivariable analysis were included in to final model after which statistical significance was declared at P<0.05. The goodness of fit was tested by Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic and Omnibus tests. Multi co-linearity was diagnosed using standard error and correlation matrix.ResultsThe prevalence of neonatal hypothermia in the study area was 66.3% (95% CI: 61.1, 70.5%). No skin to skin contact (AOR=2.87, 95% CI:1.48, 5.57), no wearing cap (AOR=2.10, 95% CI:1.17, 3.76), no warm intra-facility transportation (AOR=3.18, 95% CI: 1.84, 5.48), born to mothers having obstetric complication (AOR=2.42, 95% CI:1.28, 4.57), prematurity (AOR=3.37, 95% CI:1.53, 7.44) and neonatal health problem (AOR=4.24, 95% CI:1.92, 9.34) were significantly associated with hypothermia.ConclusionThe prevalence of neonatal hypothermia was relatively high. Therefore, adherence should be made to the thermal care mainly the cost effective ones like wearing cap, skin to skin contact and warm transportation.

AB Background: Suicidal behaviors among adolescents is a major public health concern. Psychological factors have been extensively studied known risks linked to suicidal behaviors in the general population. However, the association between food insecurity and suicidal behaviors is less researched, particularly in low and middle-income countries. The present study sought to assess the link between food insecurity and suicide behaviors among in-school adolescents.
   Methods: The present study was based on the secondary analysis of the first nationally representative sample of the 2014 Tanzania Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS). A total sample of 3,793 in-school adolescents was included in the present analysis. The primary independent variable was food insecurity while the dependent variables of interest were suicide ideation and suicide attempt. Chi-square chi(2) and multivariate logistic regression were used to ascertain the measure of statistical association. In all analyses, a p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
   Results: Of the 3,793 in-school adolescents, 254 (67%) were food insecure. A significantly large proportion of adolescents with suicidal ideation and suicidal attempt were food insecure than their counterparts, respectively. In the adjusted multivariate model, food insecure adolescents were more likely to have experienced suicidal ideation and suicidal attempt: [AOR; 18 95% C. I; 13-25] and [AOR; 24, 95% C. I; 17-33]; p < 0.001, respectively.
   Conclusion: Food insecurity was an independent predictor of suicidal behaviors among in-school adolescents. An intervention that targets food security at the school level may protect adolescents of food insecure household from suicidal behaviors. Nevertheless, school-based mental health screening, evaluation, and promotion may be needed for adolescents with suicidal behaviors.

AB BackgroundThe term evidence based medicine was introduced in the early 1990s in clinical medicine to educate clinicians about how to assess the credibility' of research to ensure best treatments for their patients. The evidence based medicine paradigm has become more diffuse in times of austerity and randomised controlled designs are being used to address complex issues in public health and disability research. This research is not addressing inequalities in terms of disability nor how people can live well with disabilities.Main textWe argue that there are four ways that public health research needs to change if it wants to address inequalities linked to disability: 1) rethinking theoretical connections between public health and disability; 2) building ethics and equity into interventions through a human rights approach; 3) ensuring ethical inclusion through intersectionality; and 4) evaluating policy and other social impacts to ensure they capture diversity. We argue that these are key issues to building a social determinants of flourishing.ConclusionsWe need to understand how disability might have an accumulative impact across the life course, as well as how to ensure equity for people living with disabilities. This means conceptualising a social determinants of flourishing where we evaluate how exactly randomised controlled trials and public health interventions, not only lead to greater equality but also ensure rights to health and wellbeing.

   DECLINE; OLDER; AGE
AB Background
   Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem. The prevalence of CKD is rising especially in elderly, as consequence of population-ageing related to socioeconomic development and better life expectancy. There are scarce studies evaluating CKD progression and its associated factors in elderly patients.
   Methods
   This is a retrospective observational study including 340 patients (>= 65 years old) CKD stages 3a-5 non-dialysis, incidents in an outpatient CKD clinic, followed by 2.1 years. CKD progression was assessed by the slope of eGFR calculated by CKD-EPI and BIS 1 equations. The patients were divided in progressor and non-progressor groups (eGFR slope < or >= 0 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/year, respectively).
   Results
   Kidney function declined in 193 (57%) patients. In this group, the progression rate was -2.83 (-5.1/-1.1) mL/min/1.73 m(2)/year. Compared to non progressor, the progressor patients were younger [72 (69-78) vs. 76 (69-80) years; p = 0.02]; had higher proportion of diabetic nephropathy, higher serum phosphorus [3.8 (3.3-4.1) vs. 3.5 (3.9-4.1) mg/dL; p = 0.04] and proteinuria [0.10 (0-0.9 vs. 0 (0-0.3)] g/L; p = 0.007)] at the admission. In the logistic regression analysis adjusted for gender and eGFR, proteinuria was independently associated with CKD progression [OR (Odds Ratio) (1.83; 95% CI, 1.17-2.86; p < 0.01)].
   Conclusion
   CKD progression was observed in the majority of elderly CKD patients and proteinuria was the most important factor associated to the decline of kidney function in this population.

AB BackgroundThe synthetic control method (SCM) is a useful tool in providing unbiased analysis on the policy effect in real-world health policy evaluations. Through controlling for a few confounding factors, we aim to apply SCM in analyzing the impact of the pricing reform on medical expenditure structure in Jiangsu Province, China.MethodsWe constructed a synthetic control for Zhenjiang, a city where the reform was piloted in Jiangsu, by selecting weights on those potential control units to define a linear combination of the control outcomes to replicate the counterfactual as if the intervention is in absence. The policy effect was measured by the differences in the percentage of drug expenditure among average outpatient and inpatient care cost per visit in the post-policy period between Zhenjiang and its synthetic control. We also examined the significance of the estimated results by performing placebo tests, and cross-validated the results with a difference-in-differences analysis.ResultsThe medical pricing reform was found to be effective in reducing the drug expenditure proportions in both outpatient and inpatient care by an estimated mean level of 7.7 and 3.2% (or 16.3 and 9.2% relative decrease to their 2012 levels) respectively. This reform effect was estimated to be significant in the placebo tests and was further confirmed by a cross-validation.ConclusionWe conclude that the pricing reform in public hospitals has significantly reduced drug expenditure incurred in both outpatient and inpatient care. This study also highlights the applicability of SCM method as an effective tool for health policy evaluation using publicly available data in the context of Chinese healthcare system.

AB BackgroundStatistics are frequently used in health advocacy to attract attention, but are often misinterpreted. The Figure Interpretation Assessment Tool-Health (FIAT-Health) 1.0 was developed to support systematic assessment of the interpretation of figures on health and health care. This study aimed to test and evaluate the FIAT-Health 1.0 amongst its intended user groups, and further refine the tool based on our results.MethodsPotential users (N=32) were asked to assess one publicly reported figure using the FIAT-Health 1.0, and to justify their assessments and share their experience in using the FIAT-Health. In total four figures were assessed. For each figure, an expert on the specific topic (N=4) provided a comparative assessment. The consistency of the answers was calculated, and answers to the evaluation questions were qualitatively analysed. A qualitative comparative analysis of the justifications for assessment by the experts and potential users was made. Based on the results, a new version of the FIAT-Health was developed and tested by employees (N=27) of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), and approved by the project's advisory group. In total sixty-three participants contributed.ResultsPotential users using the FIAT-Health 1.0 and experts gave similar justifications for their assessments. The justifications provided by experts aligned with the items of the FIAT-Health. Seventeen out of twenty-six dichotomous questions were consistently answered by the potential users. Numerical assessment questions showed inconsistencies in how potential users responded. In the evaluation, potential users most frequently mentioned that thanks to its structured approach, the FIAT-Health contributed to their awareness of the main characteristics of the figure (n=14), but they did find the tool complex (n=11). The FIAT-Health 1.0 was revised from a scoring instrument into a critical appraisal tool: the FIAT-Health 2.0, which was tested and approved by employees of the RIVM and the advisory group.ConclusionThe tool was refined according to the results of the test and evaluation, transforming the FIAT-Health from a quantitative scoring instrument into an online qualitative appraisal tool that has the potential to aid the better interpretation and public reporting of statistics on health and healthcare.

AB BackgroundThe Gulf Coast of the United States is home to mosquito vectors that may spread disease causing pathogens, and environmental conditions that are ideal for the sustained transmission of mosquito-borne pathogens. Understanding public perceptions of mosquito-borne diseases and mosquito prevention strategies is critical for the development of effective vector control strategies and public health interventions. Here, we present a survey conducted in Mobile, Alabama along the Gulf Coast to better understand public perceptions of mosquito-borne diseases, mosquito control activities, and potential risk factors.MethodsUsing Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAPs) assessments, we surveyed populations living in 12 zip codes in Mobile, Alabama using a 7-point Likert scale and frequency assessments. Survey participants were asked about vector control efforts, knowledge of mosquito-borne diseases, and understanding of mosquito ecology and breeding habitats.ResultsOne hundred twenty-six surveys were completed in Mobile, Alabama, revealing that 73% of participants reported being bitten by a mosquito in the last 30days and mosquitoes were frequently seen in their homes. Ninety-four percent of respondents had heard of Zika Virus at the time of the survey, and respondents reported being least familiar with dengue virus and chikungunya virus.ConclusionsChikungunya virus, dengue virus, malaria, West Nile virus, and Zika virus have been documented in the Gulf Coast of the United States. The mosquitoes which vector all of these diseases are presently in the Gulf Coast meaning all five diseases pose a potential risk to human health. The results of this survey emphasize knowledge gaps that public health officials can address to empower the population to reduce their risk of these mosquito-borne diseases. Each species of mosquito has specific preferences for breeding and feeding and there is no one size fits all prevention approach, educating people on the need for a variety of approaches in order to address all species will further empower them to control mosquitoes where they live and further reduce their risk of disease.

AB BackgroundThe school environment provides crucial opportunities for children to engage in health-promoting physical activity (PA). Japanese children clean their schools and have recess time every school day. The primary aim of the study is to describe the levels of physical activity during school cleaning and recess time while comparing it between genders.MethodsPA and sedentary behavior (SB) of 230 boys and 252 girls aged 6-12years-old from 14 public primary schools were assessed for 7 consecutive days with a triaxial accelerometer. Minutes of SB, and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) as a percentage in each of school cleaning time (15min/day: 58% of the 14 schools or 20min/day), morning recess time (15min/day: 6% or 20min/day) or lunch recess time (15min/day: 29%, 20min/day: 47% or 25min/day) were evaluated. A one-way analysis of variance or Student's t test was used to examine differences in %PAs and %SB between school cleaning time and morning and lunch recess time, and between genders.ResultsIn a school day, the percentage of total daily MVPA during school cleaning time, morning recess and lunch recess time was 19.46.8% (15.2 +/- 5.3min/day) for boys and 16.9 +/- 5.8% (10.5 +/- 4.3min/day) for girls. For boys, the proportions of MVPA in morning and lunch recesses and SB during the morning recess were significantly higher than during school cleaning time (p<0.001). For girls, similar results were obtained and the SB during lunch recess was also higher than during school cleaning time (p<0.001).Conclusions These findings suggest that the total amount of school cleaning time, recess and lunch time likely contribute to daily MVPA but the beneficial effects should be further explored in future intervention studies.

AB Dengue is a public health concern in northern Queensland, Australia. This study aimed to explore spatial and temporal characteristics of dengue cases in Queensland, and to identify high-risk areas after a 2009 dengue outbreak at fine spatial scale and thereby help in planning resource allocation for dengue control measures. Notifications of dengue cases for Queensland at Statistical Local Area (SLA) level were obtained from Queensland Health for the period 2010 to 2015. Spatial and temporal analysis was performed, including plotting of seasonal distribution and decomposition of cases, using regression models and creating choropleth maps of cumulative incidence. Both the space-time scan statistic (SaTScan) and Geographical Information System (GIS) were used to identify and visualise the space-time clusters of dengue cases at SLA level. A total of 1,773 dengue cases with 632 (35.65%) autochthonous cases and 1,141 (64.35%) overseas acquired cases were satisfied for the analysis in Queensland during the study period. Both autochthonous and overseas acquired cases occurred more frequently in autumn and showed a geographically expanding trend over the study period. The most likely cluster of autochthonous cases (Relative Risk, RR = 54.52, p<0.001) contained 50 SLAs in the north-east region of the state around Cairns occurred during 2013-2015. A cluster of overseas cases (RR of 60.81, p<0.001) occurred in a suburb of Brisbane during 2012 to 2013. These results show a clear spatiotemporal trend of recent dengue cases in Queensland, providing evidence in directing future investigations on risk factors of this disease and effective interventions in the high-risk areas.

AB Multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Heidelberg isolates are frequently recovered in the Netherlands from poultry meat imported from South America. Our aim was to retrospectively assess the characteristics of the antimicrobial determinants, gene content and the clonal relatedness of 122 unique S. Heidelberg isolates from chicken meat from Brazil (n = 119) and Argentina (n = 3) that were imported between 2010 and 2015. These isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, PCR and Illumina HiSeq2500 whole genome sequencing. Draft genomes were assembled to assess the gene content, and the phylogenetic relationships between isolates were determined using single nucleotide polymorphisms. Ciprofloxacin-resistance was identified in 98.4% of the isolates and 83.7% isolates showed resistance to the extended-spectrum cephalosporins cefotaxime and ceftazidime (83.6% and 82.8% respectively). Of the latter, 97.1% exhibited an AmpC phenotype and contained bla(CMY-2), whereas the remaining three isolates contained an extended spectrum beta-lactamase. Of the 99 extended-spectrum cephalosporins-resistant isolates harboring CMY-2 plasmids, 56.6% contained the incompatibility group I1 replicon. Phylogenetic cluster analysis showed that all isolates from Brazil clustered together, with 49% occurring in clusters larger than 5 isolates that revealed intra-cluster similarities based on geographical location and/or resistance profiles. The remaining isolates were classified in smaller clusters or as singletons, highlighting the large diversity of S. Heidelberg in the poultry chain in Brazil that was revealed by this study. Considering the potential public health risk associated with multidrug-resistant S. Heidelberg in imported poultry, collaborative whole genome sequencing-based surveillance is needed to monitor the spread, pathogenic properties and epidemiological distribution of these isolates.

TI Public perspectives on disinvestments in drug funding: results from a
   Canadian deliberative public engagement event on cancer drugs
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Priority setting; Cancer drug funding; Disinvestment; Public engagement
ID HEALTH-CARE; TECHNOLOGY; INTERFERON
AB Background: Decisions relating to the funding of new drugs are becoming increasingly challenging due to a combination of aging populations, rapidly increasing list prices, and greater numbers of drug-indication pairs being brought to market. This is especially true in cancer, where rapid list price inflation is coupled with steeply rising numbers of incident cancer cases. Within a publicly funded health care system, there is increasing recognition that resource allocation decisions should consider the reassessment of, and potential disinvestment from, currently funded interventions alongside new investments. Public input into the decision-making process can help legitimize the outcomes and ensure priority-setting processes are aligned with public priorities.
   Methods: In September 2014, a public deliberation event was held in Vancouver, Canada, to obtain public input on the topic of cancer drug funding. Twenty-four members of the general public were tasked with making collective recommendations for policy-makers about the principles that should guide funding decisions for cancer drugs in the province of British Columbia. Deliberative questions and decision aids were used to elicit individuals' willingness to make trade-offs between expenditures and health outcomes.
   Results: Participants discussed the implications of disinvestment decisions from cancer drugs in terms of its impact on patient choice, fairness and quality of life. Their discussions indicate that in order for a decision to disinvest from currently-funded cancer drugs to be acceptable, it must align with three main principles: the decision must be accompanied by significant gains, described both in terms of cost savings and opportunities to re-invest elsewhere in the health care system; those who are currently prescribed a cancer drug should be allowed to continue their course of treatment (referred to as a continuance clause, or "grandfathering" approach); and it must consider how access to care for specialized populations is impacted.
   Conclusions: The results from this deliberation event provide insight into what is acceptable to British Columbians with respect to disinvestment decisions for cancer drugs. These recommendations can be considered within wider health system decision-making frameworks for funding decisions relating to all drugs, as well as for cancer drugs.

AB BACKGROUND:Childhood lifestyle, health-risk behaviours contribute to two-thirds of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) premature mortality in adult populations. The co-occurrence of risk factors for NCDs is more harmful to health than that of individual risk factor effects when are added independently. The main objective of the present study was to explore the prevalence, sociodemographic distribution, and the co-occurrence of risk factors for NCDs among in-school adolescents.
   METHODS:The present study is based on the secondary analysis of the first nationwide representative sample of the 2014 Tanzania Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS). A total sample of 3,793 in-school adolescents was included in the present analysis. The dependent variables were as follows: an unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use, excessive alcohol use, and suicide attempt. The analysis involved the chi(2) test, multinomial and multivariate regression models: to determine the association between the variables of interest. In all analyses, the set level of statistical significance was a p-value of less than 0.05 at 95% confidence intervals.
   RESULTS:The most prevalent combination of risk factors for NCDs were as follows: unhealthy diet and physical inactivity 666 (17.6%); unhealthy diet and suicide attempt 151 (4.0); unhealthy diet and tobacco use 98 (2.8); and unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and suicide attempt 81 (2.1). In the adjusted regression model; having three 0.60 [0.40-0.91], and a sum of four and five 0.46 [0.28-0.79] risk factors than having no risk factor showed a significant declined with increasing in adolescents age. Primary in-school adolescents than secondary in-school adolescents were significantly more likely to have two 1.81 [1.42-2.32], three 2.40 [1.63-3.54]; and a sum of four and five 2.90 [1.61-5.13] combinations of risk factors.
   CONCLUSION:The co-occurrence of lifestyle health-risk factors for NCDs was prevalent among in-school adolescents: it was significantly higher among younger adolescents. A multi-strategy public health intervention program may be more effective than that of a single risk factor approach: therefore, suitable for resource-limited settings, such as Tanzania.

AB Background: 'Yaa Chud' is a non-prescribed poly-pharmaceutical pack containing several types of drugs, including antibiotics and steroids, which can be purchased over the counter in Thailand for self-medication. Although it is illegal, it is still available at some community outlets. This study aimed to understand access to and use of Yaa Chud at the community level in order to raise awareness on its usage and to provide policy recommendations to address the problem.
   Methods: This study employed qualitative methods, including in-depth interviews with 18 drug suppliers and 16 community members, and six focus group discussions. It included inventories from 17 drug suppliers. Data were collected in selected communities of the Kanchanaburi Demographic Surveillance System, located in the western region of Thailand. Thematic analysis was based upon the Health Services Utilization Model and conducted using the Open Code qualitative software program.
   Results: Overcrowding, long waiting times, and a perceived unwelcoming environment at public health-care service outlets were identified as factors that drive people into the private sector, where loose regulation of drug laws facilitates access and use of Yaa Chud. Migrants and older people were most likely to seek and use Yaa Chud, especially for mild illness. Availability, easy access through a user's network, low cost, and perceived effectiveness were identified as factors that enable access and use of Yaa Chud.
   Conclusions: Though illegal in Thailand, Yaa Chud is likely to remain available for self-medication by community members, due to the persisting demand by the elderly and migrant workers. There is an urgent need to replace these mixed medications with better choices. Safer Yaa Chud may be a preferred, first-line health-care option, which could help reduce congestion in the formal health-care setting. At the same time, enforcement of regulatory compliance needs to be continued in order to stop the supply of unsafe Yaa Chud.

AB BackgroundThe number of older people with unmet care and support needs is increasing substantially due to the challenges facing the formal and informal care system in the United Kingdom. Addressing these unmet needs is becoming one of the urgent public health priorities. In order to develop effective solutions to address some of these needs, it is important first to understand the care and support needs of older people.MethodsA scoping review was conducted, using the Arksey and O'Malley original and enhanced framework, to understand the care and support needs of older people, focusing on those living at home with chronic conditions in the UK. The search was conducted using five electronic data bases, grey literature and reference list checks. The WHO International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework was used to analyse and categorise the literature findings.ResultsForty studies were included in the final analysis- 32 from academic literature and 8 from grey literature. The review highlighted that older adults faced a range of physical, social and psychological challenges due to living with chronic conditions and required care and support in three main areas: 1) social activities and relationships; 2) psychological health; and 3) activities related to mobility, self-care and domestic life. The review also highlighted that many older people demonstrated a desire to cope with their illness and maintain independence, however, environmental factors interfered with these efforts including: 1) lack of professional advice on self-care strategies; 2) poor communication and coordination of services; and 3) lack of information on services such as care pathways. A gap in the knowledge was also identified about the care and support needs of two groups within the older population: 1) older workers; and 2) older carers.ConclusionsThe review highlighted that older people living with chronic conditions have unmet care needs related to their physical and psychological health, social life, as well as the environment in which they live and interact. Findings of this review also emphasized the importance of developing care models and support services based around the needs of older people.

AB BackgroundRetaining patients on antiretroviral treatment in care is critical to sustaining the 90:90:90 vision. Nigeria has made some progress in placing HIV-positive patients on treatment. In an effort to increase access to treatment, ART decentralization has been implemented in the country. This is aimed at strengthening lower level health facilities to provide comprehensive antiretroviral treatment. We determined the level of retention and adherence to treatment as well as the associated factors among private and public secondary level hospitals in Anambra State.MethodWe conducted a cross-sectional study among patients who had taken antiretroviral treatment for at least one complete year. A structured questionnaire and patient record review were used to extract information on patient adherence to treatment, and retention in care. Adherence to treatment was ascertained by patient self-report of missed pills in the 30days prior to date of interview. Retention in care was ascertained using the 3-month visit constancy method reviewing the period spanning 12months prior to the study.ResultWe found a comparable level of retention in care (private 81.1%; public 80.3%; p=0.722). However, treatment adherence was significantly higher amongst participants in the private hospitals comparedto those in the public hospitals (private: 95.3%; public: 90.7%; p=0.001). Determinants of good retention in the private hospitals included disclosure of one's HIV status (AOR: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.09-3.46), being on first-line regimen (AOR: 3.07, 95% CI: 1.27-7.41), whereas being on once-daily regimen (AOR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.36-0.92), and being currently married (AOR: 0.54 95% CI: 0.32-0.91) determined poor retention. In the public hospitals, only disclosure (AOR: 3.12 95% CI: 1.81-5.56) determined good retention, whereas, spending less than N1000 on transport (AOR: 0.230 95% CI: 0.07-0.78) and residing in a rural area (AOR: 0.64 95% CI: 0.41-0.99) determined poor retention. None of the factors determined adherence.ConclusionRetention in care was high and comparable among the different hospital types and HIV disclosure status was an important factor relating to retention in care. The other factors that determined retention were however different at public and private hospitals. The HIV program manager should consider these variations in designing programs to improve patient retention in care and adherence to treatment.

AB BackgroundThe maternal mortality rate in Lao PDR (Laos) is still the highest in Southeast Asia, at 197 per 100,000 live births. Antenatal care (ANC) could contribute to maternal and child mortality reduction. The quality of ANC service remains inadequate and little information is available on the quality of health education and counseling services of health providers in Laos. This study aims to gain insight into the perceptions of stakeholders on both supply and demand sides of public ANC services in Laos and evidence for recommendations to improve the quality of ANC services.MethodsSemi-structured interviews were conducted with 50 participants from different stakeholder groups; on the demand side, couples with a currently pregnant woman and mothers with children under one year of age and a family member; and on the supply side, health providers, managers, policy makers of the Ministry of Health, and development partners. The interviews were voice recorded and transcribed verbatim for analysis by open and thematic coding, using the MAXQDA software program.ResultsAll respondents reported that the number of pregnant women who visit ANC services has increased. However, an analysis of the supply side identified issues related to the quality of ANC that need to be improved in the areas of facilities, human resources, privacy and confidentiality, providers' behavior, attitudes, and ineffective communication skills when it comes to providing health education and counseling to pregnant women and their family members. The analysis of the demand side mainly emphasized the issues of providers' behavior, attitude, communication and unequal treatment, and the lack of privacy. Both sides also suggested solutions to the problems, such as training, effective materials, rewarding good role models, and building a feedback system.ConclusionThe number of public ANC services has increased, but both supply and demand sides experienced challenges with the quality of ANC. All respondents proposed possible solutions to improve quality of ANC service in public health facilities in Laos.

AB BackgroundThis study provides an empirical test of the reasoned action approach (RAA) socio-cognitive theory with the aim of 1) predicting the intention of public dental health personnel (PDHP) to report suspected child-maltreatment to child welfare services (CWS); 2) estimating the effects of the theoretical constructs of RAA, including experiential and instrumental attitudes, injunctive and descriptive norms, and perceived capacity and autonomy regarding PDHP's behavioural intentions; and 3) exploring whether the RAA operates equivalently (i.e., is invariant) in male and female providers.MethodsThis national cross-sectional study was conducted in Norway. An electronic survey was distributed to 1542 dentists and dental hygienists working in the public dental health service. The survey included RAA items constructed in accordance with the recommendations for the RAA model. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to identify factors derived from the theory of RAA to predict PDHP reporting intentions.ResultsA total of 77.8% (1200) of those surveyed responded to the survey. The present study provided support for the utility of the RAA across both male and female providers in predicting their intention to report suspected child-maltreatment to the CWS. The final modified SEM model revealed that instrumental attitudes and perceived behavioural control (based on merged capacity and autonomy parameters) were the strongest predictors of intention to report, followed by the reporting of descriptive norms, injunctive norms and experiential attitudes. These factors explained 63.6% of the observed variance in the reporting intention.ConclusionsThe large amount of explained variance suggests that RAA is a well-functioning theory that predicts PDHP's reporting intentions to CWS across gender, and gives an understanding of the socio-cognitive factors involved. To strengthen reporting intention among dental personnel, this study suggests educators should focus on the value and positive consequences of reporting, the resources available and how to overcome obstacles; attention to normative expectations and individuals' feelings about reporting may also be helpful.

AB BackgroundBlood transfusion is a life-saving intervention. However, the safety of the donor and the recipient is paramount. This study was aimed at determining the blood donation deferral pattern of University of Calabar Teaching Hospital.MethodsA retrospective analysis of the prospective donors' data of University of Calabar Donor clinic within the period of March 2015 to February 2016 was conducted. Data were extracted from the donor register and analyzed. Prospective donors were screened and interviewed for causes of temporary and permanent deferrals.ResultOut of the 1886 screened prospective donors, 164 (8.69%) were deferred. Though the minority of the donor population, female donors had the highest deferral rate (33.33%). There were 31.10 and 68.90% cases of temporary and permanent deferrals, respectively. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) was the highest (31.71%) cause of overall deferral as well as permanent deferral. Anemia was the major (21.95%) cause of temporary deferral as well as the second cause of overall deferrals. Commercial and replacement donors constituted 68.28 and 31.71% of the deferral cases, respectively.ConclusionHBV was found to be the overall leading cause of deferral in the studied area. This outcome poses a public health concern and should elicit measures to curb the infection rate.

SO PLOS ONE

AB Context
   Over 20 years of conflict in the DRC, North and South Kivu have experienced cycles of stability and conflict, resulting in a compromised health system and poor sexual and reproductive health outcomes. Modern contraceptive use is low (7.5%) and maternal mortality is high (846 deaths per 100,000 live births). Program partners have supported the Ministry of Health (MOH) in North and South Kivu to provide good quality contraceptive services in public health facilities since 2011.
   Methods
   Cross-sectional population-based surveys were conducted in the program areas using a two-stage cluster sampling design to ensure representation in each of six rural health zones. Using MOH population estimates for villages in the catchment areas of supported health facilities, 25 clusters in each zone were selected using probability proportional to size. Within each cluster, 22 households were systematically selected, and one woman of reproductive age (15-49 years) was randomly selected from all eligible women in each household.
   Results
   Modern contraceptive prevalence among women in union ranged from 8.4% to 26.7% in the six health zones; current use of long-acting or permanent method (LAPM) ranged from 2.5% to 19.8%. The majority of women (58.9% to 90.2%) reported receiving their current method for the first time at a health facility supported by the program partners. Over half of women in four health zones reported wanting to continue their method for five years or longer.
   Conclusion
   Current modern contraceptive use and LAPM use were high in these six health zones compared to DRC Demographic and Health Survey data nationally and provincially. These results were accomplished across all six health zones despite their varied socio-demographic characteristics and different experiences of conflict and displacement. These findings demonstrate that women in these conflict-affected areas want contraception and will choose to use it when good quality services are available to them.

AB Background
   Knee osteoarthritis (OA) worsens health-related quality of life (HRQoL) but the symptom pathway varies from person to person. We aimed to identify groups of people with knee OA or at its increased risk whose HRQoL changed similarly. Our secondary aim was to evaluate if patient-related characteristics, incidence of knee replacement (KR) and prevalence of pain medication use differed between the identified HRQoL trajectory groups.
   Methods
   Eight-year follow-up data of 3053 persons with mild knee OA or at increased risk were obtained from the public Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) database. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify patterns of experiencing a decrease of >= 10 points (Minimal Important Change, MIC) in the Quality of Life subscale of the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score compared to baseline. Multinomial logistic regression, Cox regression and generalized estimating equation models were used to study secondary aims.
   Results
   Four HRQoL trajectory groups were identified. Persons in the 'no change' group (62.9%) experienced no worsening in HRQoL. 'Rapidly' (9.5%) and 'slowly' worsening (17.1%) groups displayed an increasing probability of experiencing the MIC in HRQoL. The fourth group (10.4%) had 'improving' HRQoL. Female gender, higher body mass index, smoking, knee pain, and lower income at baseline were associated with belonging to the 'rapidly worsening' group. People in 'rapidly' (hazard ratio (HR) 6.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.6-10.7) and 'slowly' worsening (HR 3.4, 95% CI 2.0-5.9) groups had an increased risk of requiring knee replacement. Pain medication was more rarely used in the 'no change' than in the other groups.
   Conclusions
   HRQoL worsening was associated with several risk factors; surgical and pharmacological interventions were more common in the poorer HRQoL trajectory groups indicating that HRQoL does reflect the need for OA treatment. These findings may have implications for targeting interventions to specific knee OA patient groups.

TI The impact of interventions for the primary prevention of hypertension
   in Sub-Saharan Africa: A systematic review and meta-analysis
SO PLOS ONE

DT Review
ID BLOOD-PRESSURE; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; URINARY SODIUM; RISK-FACTOR;
   POPULATION; REDUCTION; DISEASE; PROGRAM
AB Background
   The prevalence of hypertension is highest in the African Region with 46% of adults aged 25 and above diagnosed with hypertension, while the lowest prevalence of 35% is found in the Americas. There is sparse evidence on the approaches used to prevent hypertension in Sub-Saharan Africa and the effectiveness of these approaches. It is therefore imperative that a systematic review; which synthesises all the available evidence on the approaches and their impact is conducted to inform public health policy and practice.
   Objective
   To synthesise evidence on the interventions used for the primary prevention of hypertension in Sub-Saharan Africa and to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing blood pressure, hypertension prevalence and the risk factors for hypertension.
   Methods and results
   This systematic review was reported per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Bibliographic databases were searched on the 4th-17th of January 2018 from 1970 to January 2018 and on the 5 th of May 2019 from 1970 to May 2019, for studies focusing on the primary prevention of hypertension in communities in Sub-Saharan Africa. A narrative synthesis was conducted based on study interventions and outcomes. Also, a meta-analysis was carried out using pooled mean differences; using a random effects model of generic inverse variance option in RevMan. A total of 854 studies were identified after deduplication, with thirteen studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Six studies with varying interventions and methodologies observed a significant pooled reduction in systolic blood pressure of -3.3mmHg (95% CI -4.64 to -1.96) and a reduction of -2.26mmHg (95% CI -6.36 to 1.85) in diastolic blood pressure, which was not statistically significant (p = 0.28). Also, moderate to significant heterogeneity was observed (I-2 = 68% and 99%) for the systolic and diastolic blood pressure respectively. Intervention and study design accounted for 100% heterogeneity for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (r(2) = 100%).
   Conclusion
   Health promotion and interventions targeting various risk factors of hypertension and, salt consumption restriction interventions have been employed in Sub-Saharan Africa with varying levels of success. We recommend that higher quality studies and a meta-analysis are needed to evaluate the impact of these interventions and to inform public health policy and practice.

AB Background: Trust has been introduced as the cornerstone of the public and health providers' relation. Public trust in primary health care (PHC) is crucial and must be measured. The aim of this study was to develop and validate PHC trust measurement tool.
   Methods: This was a psychometric study to develop PHC trust measuring tool done in Tabriz, East-Azerbaijan with participation of 600 households in 2016. Item generation was done through literature review and experts opinions. The content validity, reliability and construct validity of the PHC trust tool were assessed using several statistical methods including modified Kappa, Kendall's Tau and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) as well as exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Data were analyzed using STATA 14 statistical software package.
   Results: A 30-item questionnaire was developed. The Modified Kappa coefficient as an indicator of content validity assessment was 0.94. With respect to reliability assessment, a high internal consistency was observed with 0.98 Cronbach-Alpha score and the test-retest reliability for overall scale (assessed by ICC) was 0.94 (CI: 0.87-0.97). Exploratory factor analysis emerged 2 factors. Factor 1 consisted of 25 items accounting for 74.1% of the variance (eigenvalue = 22.47) followed by Factor 2 consisting of 5 items accounting for 19.2% of the variance (eigenvalue = 1.6).
   Conclusion: PHC trust measuring tool could be used as a valid and reliable tool by health systems in Iran and similar contexts to investigate how they are trustful from the public viewpoint.

AB Background: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection in children is an important public health problem in China. We performed the current study to explore the seroprevalence of VZV infection in Chinese children in order to provide more information for improvement of varicella vaccination in China.
   Methods: Three thousand fourteen children were recruited from Chinese kindergarten students aged from four to sixyears. Anti-VZV IgG and IgM were assayed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Both ORF22 and ORF62 of VZV were amplified, sequenced, and analyzed by nested PCR.
   Results: Among 3014 children, 43.9% of boys and 46.3% of girls were vaccinated with varicella vaccine, respectively. The seroprevalence of anti-VZV IgG was 54.4% in the children with varicella vaccination, which was significantly higher than those in unvaccinated children (49.2%) (chi(2)=8.206, P=0.004). Among of the vaccinated children, the detection rates of VZV IgG antibody increased with age, with 49.4, 50.9 and 58.9% in 4, 5 and 6-year groups, respectively (Trend chi(2)=17.202, P=0.002). However, there was no difference in anti-VZV IgG detection rates among those unvaccinated children in different age groups (Trend chi(2)=8.681, P=0.070). In addition, 13 boys and 13 girls were positive for anti-VZV IgM, respectively. Among of them, eight children (0.6%) have received varicella vaccination, which was similar to those in unvaccinated children (1.1%). However, only one ORF22 sequence was isolated from an unvaccinated 5-year boy. Compared to the reference VZV sequences, the nucleotide homology was estimated to be 99.7% with genotype J.
   Conclusions: Our study indicated that about half of Chinese children aged four to sixyears have a high risk of VZV infection. It should be helpful for the evaluation on the necessity of varicella immunization in China.

AB Background: The diagnoses of active smear negative PTB, remains difficult. As a result, treatment is often carried out empirically relaying on clinical criteria. The distribution and magnitude of smear negative PTB, smear negative MDR-TB and associated factors in the same day diagnosis strategy are not clearly known in the study area. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of TB, MDR-TB and associated risk factors among presumptive smear negative pulmonary tuberculosis patients in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
   Methods: Analytic cross sectional study design was used. A total of 418 smear negative presumptive pulmonary TB patients were enrolled from selected health facilities since August 01, 2017 to January 5, 2018. Sputum samples were examined by Ziehl Neelsen microscopy, Xpert MTB/RIF assay and Culture. Drug susceptibility testing was performed by line probe assay and BACTEC MGIT 960 system. These laboratory tests were performed in Ethiopian Public Health Institute, National TB Reference Laboratory. Data was analyzed by SPSS Ver.20.
   Results: From the total of 418 enrolled patients, 27 (6.5%) were Xpert MTB/ RIF and 26 (6.4%) were culture confirmed smear negative PTB patients. The positivity rate among male and female was 10.2 and 3.5% (p=0.005) respectively. From 26 culture positive isolates 3 (11.54%) were MDR TB; from MDR-TB confirmed isolates 2/23 (8.7%) were among new and 1/3 (33.3%) was among retreatment smear negative presumptive pulmonary TB patients. All Rifampicin resistant smear negative pulmonary TB isolates by Xpert MTB/ RIF assay were found to be MDR TB and 7/26 (26.9%) isolates were INH mono resistant. History of migration found to be a potential factor for developing smear negative pulmonary TB.
   Conclusion: In this study a significant proportion of smear negative pulmonary TB was diagnosed. Furthermore, a high smear negative multi drug resistant (MDR) TB and other mono drug resistant TB prevalence was confirmed. Due to the limitations of smear microscopy which is used as a primary diagnostic tool, these TB strains are missed to be diagnosed and transmission continues in the community.

   IDENTIFICATION; OUTBREAK; CULTURE
AB Background: Avian influenza virus (AIV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) are important avian pathogens that can cause enormous economic loss on the poultry industry. Different respiratory etiological agents may induce similar clinical signs that make differential diagnosis difficult. Importantly, AIV brings about severe threat to human public health. Therefore, a novel method that can distinguish these viruses quickly and simultaneously is urgently needed.
   Results: In this study, an oligonucleotide microarray system was developed. AIV, including H5, H7, and H9 subtypes; NDV; and IBV were simultaneously detected and differentiated on a microarray. Three probes specific for AIV, NDV, and IBV, as well as three other probes for differentiating H5, H7, and H9 of AIV, were first designed and jet-printed to predetermined locations of initiator-integrated poly(dimethylsiloxane) for the synchronous detection of the six pathogens. The marked multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were hybridized with the specific probes, and the results of hybridization were read directly with the naked eyes. No cross-reaction was observed with 10 other subtypes of AIV and infectious bursal disease virus, indicating that the oligonucleotide microarray assay was highly specific. The sensitivity of the method was at least 100 times higher than that of the conventional PCR, and the detection limit of NDV, AIV, H5, H7, and H9 can reach 0.1 EID50 (50% egg infective dose), except that of IBV, which was 1 EID50 per reaction. In the validation of 93 field samples, AIV, IBV, and NDV were detected in 53 (56.99%) samples by oligonucleotide microarray and virus isolation and in 50 (53.76%) samples by conventional PCR.
   Conclusions: We have successfully developed an approach to differentiate AIV, NDV, IBV, H5, H7, and H9 subtypes of AIV using oligonucleotide microarray. The microarray is an accurate, high-throughput, and relatively simple method for the rapid detection of avian respiratory viral diseases. It can be used for the epidemiological surveillance and diagnosis of AIV, IBV, and NDV.

AB The global obesity epidemic constitutes a major cause of morbidity and mortality challenging public health care systems worldwide. Thus, a better understanding of its pathophysiology and the development of novel therapeutic options are urgently needed. Recently, alterations of the intestinal microbiome in the obese have been discussed as a promoting factor in the pathophysiology of obesity and as a contributing factor to related diseases such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. The present pilot study investigated the effect of a structured weight loss program on fecal microbiota in obese type 2 diabetics. Twelve study subjects received a low-calorie formula diet for six weeks, followed by a nine week food reintroduction and stabilization period. Fecal microbiota were determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of stool samples at baseline, after six weeks and at the end of the study after fifteen weeks. All study subjects lost weight continuously throughout the program. Changes in fecal microbiota were most pronounced after six weeks of low-calorie formula diet, but reverted partially until the end of the study. However, the gut microbiota phylogenetic diversity increased persistently. The abundance of Collinsella, which has previously been associated with atherosclerosis, decreased significantly during the weight loss program. This study underlines the impact of dietary changes on the intestinal microbiome and further demonstrates the beneficial effects of weight loss on gut microbiota.

AB In Cambodia, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is predominantly transmitted between spouses and casual partners, with men having higher mortality and morbidity from HIV infection than women due to lesser access to healthcare services and antiretroviral therapy. This study aimed to identify the rate of HIV testing and barriers to HIV testing among the general male population in Cambodia. We analyzed secondary data of men who underwent HIV testing at Voluntary Confidential Counseling and Testing (VCCT) sites in 2006-2017 and of male participants in the Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey (CDHS) in 2005, 2010, and 2014. The number of men who underwent HIV testing at the VCCT sites increased during 2006-2010 and decreased during 2012-2015. CDHS data showed that the lifetime prevalence of HIV testing among men aged 15-49 years gradually increased from 14.7% in 2005 to 36.4% in 2014. Multivariate analysis revealed nine factors associated with a higher lifetime prevalence of HIV testing including: seven sociodemographic factors, namely CDHS year (2010 and 2014), age groups (20-35 and 36-49 years), urban residence, higher education, higher wealth index, having occupations other than agriculture, ever-married status (married and widowed/divorced); and two factors of HIV risk behavior, namely two or more lifetime sexual partners and condom use during the last sexual intercourse. To our knowledge, this is the first study that assessed factors associated with the lifetime prevalence of HIV testing among the general male population in Cambodia. The factors were mostly sociodemographic factors, and no factors were related to condom use, or the diagnosis or symptoms of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). These results suggest that reproductive health education at primary schools and strengthening of healthcare provider-initiated testing and counseling for patients with STIs are highly needed in Cambodia.

TI Service environment link and false discovery rate correction:
   Methodological considerations in population and health facility surveys

AB Background
   Geospatial data are important in monitoring many aspects of healthcare development. Geographically linking health facility data with population data is an important area of public health research. Examining healthcare problems spatially and hierarchically assists with efficient resource allocation and the monitoring and evaluation of service efficacy at different levels. This paper explored methodological issues associated with geographic data linkage, and the spatial and multilevel analyses that could be considered in analysing maternal health service data.
   Methods
   The 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey and the 2014 Ethiopia Service Provision Assessment data were used. Two geographic data linking methods were used to link these two datasets. Administrative boundary link was used to link a sample of health facilities data with population survey data for analysing three areas of maternal health service use. Euclidean buffer link was used for a census of hospitals to analyse caesarean delivery use in Ethiopia. The Global Moran's I and the Getis-Ord Gi* statistics need to be carried out for identifying hot spots of maternal health service use in ArcGIS software. In addition to this, since the two datasets contain hierarchical data, a multilevel analysis was carried out to identify key determinants of maternal health service use in Ethiopia.
   Results
   Administrative boundary link gave more types of health facilities and more maternal health services as compared to the Euclidean buffer link. Administrative boundary link is the method of choice in case of sampled health facilities. However, for a census of health facilities, the Euclidean buffer link is the appropriate choice as this provides cluster level service environment estimates, which the administrative boundary link does not. Applying a False Discovery Rate correction enables the identification of true spatial clusters of maternal health service use.
   Conclusions
   A service environment link minimizes the methodological issues associated with geographic data linkage. A False Discovery Rate correction needs to be used to account for multiple and dependent testing while carrying out local spatial statistics. Examining maternal health service use both spatially and hierarchically has tremendous importance for identifying geographic areas that need special emphasis and for intervention purposes.

   PREFERENCE
AB Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are a way to assess priority-setting in health care provision. This approach allows for the evaluation of individuals' preferences as a means of adding criteria to traditional quality-adjusted life year analysis. The aim of this systematic literature review was to identify attributes for designing a DCE in order to then develop and validate a framework that supports decision-making on health technologies. Our systematic literature review replicated the methods and search terms used by de Bekker-Grob et al. 2012 and Clark et al. 2014. The Medline database was searched for articles dated between 2008 and 2015. The search was limited to studies in English that reflected general preferences and were choice-based, published as full-text articles and related to health technologies. This study included 72 papers, 52% of which focused on DCEs on drug treatments. The average number of attributes used in all included DCE studies was 5.74 (SD 1.98). The most frequently used attributes in these DCEs were improvements in health (78%), side effects (57%) and cost of treatment (53%). Other, less frequently used attributes included waiting time for treatment or duration of treatment (25%), severity of disease (7%) and value for money (4%). The attributes identified might inform future DCE surveys designed to study societal preferences regarding health technologies in order to better inform decisions in health technology assessment.

TI Prevalence of depressive symptoms among older adults who reported
   medical cost as a barrier to seeking health care: findings from a

ID SOCIAL SUPPORT; RISK-FACTORS; LATE-LIFE; ASSOCIATION; BURDEN;
   BENEFICIARIES; EXPENDITURES; ANXIETY; ACCESS
AB Background: Older adults aged 65 and over will make up more than 20% of U.S. residents by 2030, and in 2050, this population will reach 83.7 million. Depression among older adults is a major public health concern projected to be the second leading cause of disease burden. Despite having Medicare, and other employer supplements, the burden of out of pocket healthcare expenses may be an important predictor of depression. The current study aims to investigate whether delay in seeing a doctor when needed but could not because of medical cost is significantly associated with symptoms of current depression in older adults.
   Methods: Cross-sectional data from the 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BFRSS) from 12 states and Puerto Rico were used for this study (n = 24,018).
   Results: The prevalence of symptoms of current depression among older adults who reported medical cost as a barrier to seeking health care was significantly higher (17.8%) when compared to older adults who reported medical cost not being a barrier to seeking health care (5.5%). Older adults who reported medical cost as a barrier to seeking health care were more likely to report current depressive symptoms compared to their counterparts [Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 2.2 [95% CI: 1.5-3.3]).
   Conclusions: Older adults (>= 65 years of age) who experience the burden of medical cost for health care are significantly more likely to report symptoms of depression. Health care professionals and policymakers should consider effective interventions to improve access to health care among older adults.

AB Background: Cardiovascular disease remains the most common cause of death. However, effective and timely secondary care contributes to improved quality of life, decreased morbidity and mortality. This study analyzed the medical care of patients in a resource limiting country with a first presentation of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
   Methods: A cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted on first time AMI patients admitted between March 1st 2011 and March 31st 2015 to the only tertiary public hospital in a resource limiting country, Trinidad. Relevant data were obtained from all confirmed AMI patients.
   Results: Data were obtained from 1106 AMI patients who were predominantly male and of Indo Trinidadian descent. Emergency treatment included aspirin (97.2%), clopidogrel (97.2%), heparin (81.3%) and thrombolysis (70.5% of 505 patients with ST elevation MI), but none of the patients had primary angioplasty. Thrombolysis was higher among younger patients and in men. There were no differences in age, sex, and ethnicity in all other treatments. Of the 360 patients with recorded times, 41.1% arrived at the hospital within 4h. The proportion of patients receiving thrombolysis (door to needle time) within 30min was 57.5%. In-patient treatment medication included: aspirin (87.1%), clopidogrel (87.2%), beta blockers (76.5%), ACEI (72.9%), heparin (80.6%), and simvastatin (82.5%). Documentation of risk stratification, use of angiogram and surgical intervention, initiation of cardiac rehabilitation (CR), and information on behavioral changes were rare. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac enzyme tests were universally performed, while echocardiogram was performed in 57.1% of patients and exercise stress test was performed occasionally. Discharge treatment was limited to medication and referrals for investigations. Few patients were given lifestyle and activity advice and referred for CR. The in-hospital death rate was 6.5%. There was a significantly higher relative risk of in-hospital death for non-use of aspirin, clopidogrel, simvastatin, beta blockers, and heparin, but not ACE inhibitors and nitrates.
   Conclusions: Medication usage was high among AMI patients. However, there was very minimal use of non-pharmacological measures. No differences were found in prescribed medication by age, sex, or ethnicity, with the exception of thrombolysis.
