TI Unbiased assessment of disease surveillance utilities: A prospect theory

SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English

ID RISK
AB Objectives We contribute a new methodological approach to the ongoing efforts towards evaluating public health surveillance. Specifically, we apply a descriptive framework, grounded in prospect theory (PT), for the evaluation of decisions on disease surveillance deployment. We focus on two attributes of any surveillance system: timeliness, and false positive rate (FPR).
   Methods In a sample of 69 health professionals from a number of health related networks polled online, we elicited PT preferences, specifically respondents' attitudes towards gains, losses and probabilities (i.e., if they overweight or underweight extreme probabilities) by means of a series of lotteries for either timeliness or FPR. Moreover, we estimated willingness to pay (WTP) for improvements in the two surveillance attributes. For contextualization, we apply our framework to rabies surveillance.
   Results Our data reveal considerable probability weighting, both for gains and losses. In other words, respondents underestimate their chances of getting a good outcome in uncertain situations, and they overestimate their chances of bad outcomes. Moreover, there is convex utility for losses and loss aversion, that is, losses loom larger than gains of the same absolute magnitude to the respondents. We find no differences between the estimated parameters for timeliness and FPR. The median WTP is $7,250 per day gained in detection time and $30 per 1/10,000 reduction in FPR.
   Conclusion Our results indicate that the biases described by PT are present among public health professionals, which highlights the need to incorporate a PT framework when eliciting their preferences for surveillance systems.

TI Whole genome sequence of Vibrio cholerae directly from dried spotted

DT Article
ID MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY; CLASSICAL BIOTYPE; ARTEMIS; O1
AB Background Global estimates for cholera annually approximate 4 million cases worldwide with 95,000 deaths. Recent outbreaks, including Haiti and Yemen, are reminders that cholera is still a global health concern. Cholera outbreaks can rapidly induce high death tolls by overwhelming the capacity of health facilities, especially in remote areas or areas of civil unrest. Recent studies demonstrated that stool specimens preserved on filter paper facilitate molecular analysis of Vibrio cholerae in resource limited settings. Specimens preserved in a rapid, low-cost, safe and sustainable manner for sequencing provides previously unavailable data about circulating cholera strains. This may ultimately provide new information to shape public policy response on cholera control and elimination.
   Methodology/Principal findings Whole genome sequencing (WGS) recovered close to a complete sequence of the V. cholerae O1 genome with satisfactory genome coverage from stool specimens enriched in alkaline peptone water (APW) and V. cholerae culture isolates, both spotted on filter paper. The minimum concentration of V. cholerae DNA sufficient to produce quality genomic information was 0.02 ng/L. The genomic data confirmed the presence or absence of genes of epidemiological interest, including cholera toxin and pilus loci. WGS identified a variety of diarrheal pathogens from APW-enriched specimen spotted filter paper, highlighting the potential for this technique to explore the gut microbiome, potentially identifying co-infections, which may impact the severity of disease. WGS demonstrated that these specimens fit within the current global cholera phylogenetic tree, identifying the strains as the 7(th) pandemic El Tor.
   Conclusions WGS results allowed for mapping of short reads from APW-enriched specimen and culture isolate spotted filter papers this provided valuable molecular epidemiological sequence information on V. cholerae strains from remote, low-resource settings. These results identified the presence of co-infecting pathogens while providing rare insight into the specific V. cholerae strains causing outbreaks in cholera-endemic areas.
   Author summary Cholera affects more than 4 million people globally every year; people predominantly living in poverty or in resource-constrained conditions including political crises or natural disasters. Cholera's typical presentation is characterized by rapid onset of acute watery diarrhea and vomiting which can progress from watery stool to shock in as little as four hours. Laboratory conditions needed for culture confirmation and strain preservation are rarely to never present in these affected areas. In fact, many cholera endemic areas in Sub-Saharan African are so remote that even treatment response alone is often challenging. Here we present the genomic analysis of DNA extracted from dried filter paper, which is a low-cost, low-tech and sustainable method. Previously this method has facilitated cholera confirmation by PCR, but we demonstrate that this method is also suitable for whole genome sequencing and subsequent strain characterization by presenting the analysis of samples from an outbreak in a remote area of Cameroon. This method will facilitate the understanding of the molecular epidemiology in cholera-prone areas, which were previously too challenging to attempt. It also introduces a method that can be used on a broader scale for diarrheal disease surveillance, including providing a window into co-infection and microbiome analyses.

   PLASMODIUM; GENERATION; PARASITE
AB Background Sexual reproduction provides an evolutionary advantageous mechanism that combines favorable mutations that have arisen in separate lineages into the same individual. This advantage is especially pronounced in microparasites as allelic reassortment among individuals caused by sexual reproduction promotes allelic diversity at immune evasion genes within individuals which is often essential to evade host immune systems. Despite these advantages, many eukaryotic microparasites exhibit highly-clonal population structures suggesting that genetic exchange through sexual reproduction is rare. Evidence supporting clonality is particularly convincing in the causative agent of Chagas disease, Trypanosoma cruzi, despite equally convincing evidence of the capacity to engage in sexual reproduction.
   Methodology/ Principle Findings In the present study, we investigated two hypotheses that can reconcile the apparent contradiction between the observed clonal population structure and the capacity to engage in sexual reproduction by analyzing the genome sequences of 123 T. cruzi isolates from a natural population in Arequipa, Peru. The distribution of polymorphic markers within and among isolates provides clear evidence of the occurrence of sexual reproduction. Large genetic segments are rearranged among chromosomes due to crossing over during meiosis leading to a decay in the genetic linkage among polymorphic markers compared to the expectations from a purely asexually-reproducing population. Nevertheless, the population structure appears clonal due to a high level of inbreeding during sexual reproduction which increases homozygosity, and thus reduces diversity, within each inbreeding lineage.
   Conclusions/ Significance These results effectively reconcile the apparent contradiction by demonstrating that the clonal population structure is derived not from infrequent sex in natural populations but from high levels of inbreeding. We discuss epidemiological consequences of this reproductive strategy on genome evolution, population structure, and phenotypic diversity of this medically important parasite.
   Author summary The rearrangement of alleles among individuals in a population during sexual reproduction maintains high allelic diversity within individuals in a population at polymorphic genes. Allelic diversity within individuals can be particularly important for parasites as it enhances their ability to evade host immune systems. Despite the potential benefits of sexual reproduction for parasites, natural populations of the protozoan parasiteand causative agent of human Chagas diseaseTrypanosoma cruzi, exhibit clonal population structures indicative of asexual reproduction. This is particularly surprising as T. cruzi has the capacity for sexual reproduction. Here, we resolve this apparent contradiction by sequencing whole genomes of 123 T. cruzi isolates from a natural population in Arequipa, Peru. Evidence of past sexual reproduction and allelic rearrangements are common in this T. cruzi population. However, the majority of sexual reproduction events occur between close relatives resulting in an apparent clonal population structure. Sexual reproduction with distant relatives in areas with greater strain diversity has the potential to affect public health by increasing diversity in immune evasion genes within individuals and enhancing within-host survival, rapidly diversifying antigens that could affect the sensitivity of serological diagnostics, and by generating diversity in pathogenicity or drug resistance.

AB Background The liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini infects several million people in Southeast Asia. Adult flukes live in the bile ducts of humans, where they cause hepatobiliary pathology, including cholangiocarcinoma. Here, we investigated the potential of extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by the fluke and defined recombinant proteins derived from EVs to generate protective immunity in a hamster vaccination-challenge model.
   Methodology/Principal findings EVs isolated from the excretory-secretory products of O. viverrini and two recombinant EV surface proteins encoding the large extracellular loops (LEL) of Ov-TSP-2 (rOv-TSP-2) and Ov-TSP-3 (rOv-TSP-3) were adjuvanted and used to vaccinate hamsters intraperitoneally followed by challenge infection with O. viverrini metacercariae. The number of adult flukes recovered from hamsters immunized with EVs, rOv-TSP-2, rOv-TSP-3 and rOv-TSP-2+rOv-TSP-3 were significantly reduced compared to control animals vaccinated with adjuvant alone. The number of eggs per gram feces was also significantly reduced in hamsters vaccinated with rOv-TSP-2 compared to controls, but no significant differences were found in the other groups. The average length of worms recovered from hamsters vaccinated with EVs, rOv-TSP-2 and rOv-TSP-3 was significantly shorter than that of worms recovered from the control group. Anti-EV IgG levels in serum and bile were significantly higher in hamsters vaccinated with EVs compared to control hamsters both pre- and post-challenge. In addition, levels of anti-rOv-TSP antibodies in the serum and bile were significantly higher than control hamsters both pre- and post-challenge. Finally, antibodies against rOv-TSP-2 and rOv-TSP-3 blocked uptake of EVs by human primary cholangiocyte in vitro, providing a plausible mechanism by which these vaccines exert partial efficacy and reduce the intensity of O. viverrini infection.
   Conclusion/Significance Liver fluke EVs and recombinant tetraspanins derived from the EV surface when administered to hamsters induce antibody responses that block EV uptake by target bile duct cells and exert partial efficacy and against O. viverrini challenge.
   Author summary Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a significant public health problem in countries throughout Southeast Asia. In these areas CCA has a strong association with chronic infection with the food-borne liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini. Current control of the infection relies on chemotherapy and health education, however these approaches are not sustainable in isolation. Hence, there is an urgent need for a vaccine against this neglected tropical disease. A vaccine against O. viverrini would confer anti-cancer protection in similar fashion to the acclaimed vaccine for human papillomavirus and cervical cancer. Toward this goal, secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) of O. viverrini and recombinant proteins from the surface of EVs were generated and tested as vaccines in a hamster challenge model. Vaccination of hamsters with EVs and recombinant proteins induced production of antibodies in serum and bile, and those antibodies blocked uptake of EVs by primary bile duct cells in vitro. Challenge of vaccinated hamsters with infective stage flukes markedly reduced adult fluke recovery compared to the adjuvant control group. This is the first report of successful vaccination of hamsters with O. viverrini EVs and recombinant vesicle surface proteins, and provides proof-of-concept for development of subunit vaccines for this carcinogenic infection.

AB Background Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, is a protozoan parasite transmitted to humans by blood-sucking triatomine vectors. However, and despite its utmost biological and epidemiological relevance, T. cruzi development inside the digestive tract of the insect remains a poorly understood process.
   Methods/Principle findings Here we showed that Gp35/50 kDa mucins, the major surface glycoproteins from T. cruzi insect-dwelling forms, are involved in parasite attachment to the internal cuticle of the triatomine rectal ampoule, a critical step leading to its differentiation into mammal-infective forms. Experimental evidence supporting this conclusion could be summarized as follows: i) native and recombinant Gp35/50 kDa mucins directly interacted with hindgut tissues from Triatoma infestans, as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence assays; ii) transgenic epimastigotes over-expressing Gp35/50 kDa mucins on their surface coat exhibited improved attachment rates (similar to 2-3 fold) to such tissues as compared to appropriate transgenic controls and/or wild-type counterparts; and iii) certain chemically synthesized compounds derived from Gp35/50 kDa mucins were able to specifically interfere with epimastigote attachment to the inner lining of T. infestans rectal ampoules in ex vivo binding assays, most likely by competing with or directly blocking insect receptor(s). A solvent-exposed peptide (smugS peptide) from the Gp35/50 kDa mucins protein scaffolds and a branched, Galf-containing trisaccharide (Galf1-4[Galp1-6]GlcNAc) from their O-linked glycans were identified as main adhesion determinants for these molecules. Interestingly, exogenous addition of a synthetic Galf1-4[Galp1-6]GlcNAc derivative or of oligosaccharides containing this structure impaired the attachment of Dm28c but not of CL Brener epimastigotes to triatomine hindgut tissues; which correlates with the presence of Galf residues on the Gp35/50 kDa mucins' O-glycans on the former but not the latter parasite clone.
   Conclusion/Significance These results provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying T. cruzi-triatomine interplay, and indicate that inter-strain variations in the O-glycosylation of Gp35/50 kDa mucins may lead to differences in parasite differentiation and hence, in parasite transmissibility to the mammalian host. Most importantly, our findings point to Gp35/50 kDa mucins and/or the Galf biosynthetic pathway, which is absent in mammals and insects, as appealing targets for the development of T. cruzi transmission-blocking strategies.
   Author summary Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is a life-long and debilitating neglected illness of major significance to Latin America public health, for which no vaccine or adequate drugs are yet available. In this scenario, identification of novel drug targets and/or strategies aimed at controlling parasite transmission are urgently needed. By using ex vivo binding assays together with different biochemical and genetic approaches, we herein show that Gp35/50 kDa mucins, the major T. cruzi epimastigote surface glycoproteins, specifically adhere to the internal cuticle of the rectal ampoule of the triatomine vector, a critical step leading to their differentiation into mammal-infective metacyclic forms. Ex vivo binding assays in the presence of chemically synthesized analogs allowed the identification of a solvent-exposed peptide and a branched, galactofuranose (Galf)-containing trisaccharide (Galf1-4[Galp1-6]GlcNAc) as major Gp35/50 kDa mucins adhesion determinants. Overall, these results provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying the complex T. cruzi-triatomine interplay. In addition, and since the presence of Galf-based glycotopes on the O-glycans of Gp35/50 kDa mucins is restricted to certain parasite strains/clones, they also indicate that the Galf1-4[Galp1-6]GlcNAc motif may contribute to the well-established phenotypic variability among T. cruzi isolates. Most importantly, and taking into account that Galf residues are not found in mammals, we propose Gp35/50 kDa mucins and/or Galf biosynthesis as appealing and novel targets for the development of T. cruzi transmission-blocking strategies.

AB Introduction Awareness of the public health importance of tungiasis has been growing in East Africa in recent years, but data on epidemiological characteristics necessary for the planning and implementation of control measures do not exist. The work presented here was part of a larger cross-sectional study on the epidemiology of tungiasis in coastal Kenya and aims at identifying risk factors of tungiasis and severe disease in school children.
   Methods A total of 1,829 students of all age groups from five schools and 56 classes were clinically examined for tungiasis on their feet based on standardized procedures and observations made about the school infrastructure. To investigate the impact of school holidays, observations were repeated after school holidays in a subset of children in one school. In an embedded case-control study, structured interviews were conducted with 707 students in the five schools to investigate associations between tungiasis and household infrastructure, behaviour and socio-economic status.
   Results The overall prevalence of tungiasis was 48%; children below the age of 15 years were the most affected, and boys were twice as likely as girls to be infected. The highest risk of disease was associated with the socio-economic circumstances of the individual student at home. The study indicated that mild to moderate tungiasis could be reduced by a third, and severe tungiasis by over half, if sleeping places of children had hardened floors, whilst approximately a seventh of the cases could be prevented by sealing classroom floors in schools, and another fifth by using soap for daily feet washing.
   Conclusion There is a clear role for public health workers to expand the WASH policy to include washing of feet with soap in school-aged children to fight tungiasis and to raise awareness of the importance of sealed floors.
   Author summary Tungiasis is a neglected tropical skin disease caused by penetrated sand fleas, the adult female of which burrows into the skin of the feet. The parasite rapidly expands its body size by a factor of 2000. The growth causes immense itching, inflammation, pain and debilitation. The current lack of good treatment methods means people attempt to remove the fleas themselves with non-sterile instruments causing more damage. Control efforts focus on prevention but there is little data to guide this in East Africa. The current study reinforces our previously published results on the household level from the same communities, indicating that prevention needs to focus on hardening the floors of resource-poor families and integrating daily foot washing with soap into water, hygiene and sanitation programs.

AB In recent years, an increasing number of outbreaks of Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika viruses have been reported in Asia and the Americas. Monitoring virus genotype diversity is crucial to understand the emergence and spread of outbreaks, both aspects that are vital to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies. Hence, we developed an efficient method to classify virus sequences with respect to their species and sub-species (i.e. serotype and/or genotype). This tool provides an easy-to-use software implementation of this new method and was validated on a large dataset assessing the classification performance with respect to whole-genome sequences and partial-genome sequences. Available online: http://krisp.org.za/tools.php.
   Author summary Dengue (DENV), Chikungunya (CHIKV) and Zika (ZIKV) are considered major public health challenges. In addition to the epidemic caused by DENV, which has been described in many tropical countries, the introduction of CHIKV and ZIKV in these countries is a major public health concern. These arboviruses are primarily transmitted by mosquitoes of the species Ae. Aegypti and its related diseases result in increased financial costs associated with diagnosis and treatment. To support the design of efficient diagnosis, prevention and treatment strategies, a bioinformatics tool has been developed for the genotyping of these viruses based on appropriate evolutionary models in an automatic, accurate and rapid manner. A set of virus reference sequences was obtained from GenBank and used for the development of the tools. This process involved the alignment of the reference sequences followed by phylogenetic tree reconstructions. To assign the genotypes uploaded by the user, the tool analyses the sequences one by one, genotypes through identification, alignment and phylogenetic reconstruction. This computational method allows the high-throughput classification of these virus species and genotypes in seconds. As shown experimentally, genotypes are classified most confidently using the envelope gene or complete genome sequences.

ID ELIMINATION; JAPONICUM
AB Schistosomiasis is a chronic but preventable disease that affects 260 million people worldwide. In the Philippines, 860,000 people are afflicted with Schistosoma japonicum annually, and another 6.7 million live in endemic areas. The disease's complex epidemiology as well as the influence of poverty in endemic areas demand an integrated, multi-sectoral approach to disease control. Results from behavioral or sociocultural studies on schistosomiasis could improve the content and impact of schistosomiasis control in rural villages in the Philippines. We investigated knowledge, attitudes and practices related to schistosomiasis transmission and control in an endemic village in Leyte Province, Philippines. We administered a questionnaire to 219 participants covering 1) knowledge and attitudes related to schistosomiasis, its symptoms, and its transmission; 2) attitudes and practices in relation to schistosomiasis prevention; 3) willingness to comply with public health control programs; and 4) whether the respondent had previously contracted schistosomiasis. Responses revealed fairly high measures of schistosomiasis knowledge (mean 17.0 out of 23 questions, range 6-23), but also inconsistent disease prevention behavior. A high proportion of participants (72.6%, n = 159) reported previous disease. Participant belief in the preventability of schistosomiasis was revealed to be a key attitude, as carabao owners who believed in prevention were over five times more likely to be willing to vaccinate their carabaos (OR = 5.24, 95% CI 1.20-27.68, P = 0.04). Additionally, participants who did not believe in prevention were about twice as likely to report previous disease (OR = 2.31, 95% CI 1.02-5.63, P = 0.05). Our results suggest that future public health interventions should address barriers to disease-preventing behavior, as well as maintaining community belief in disease prevention. Comprehensive disease control programs should be supplemented by sociocultural and behavioral context in order to improve their impact in endemic communities.
   Author summary Schistosomiasis is a chronic tropical disease caused by parasitic worms of the genus Schistosoma. In the Philippines, Schistosoma japonicum afflicts over 800,000 people annually, and another 6.7 million live in endemic areas. The current national control program based on human mass treatment has been unable to eliminate schistosomiasis on its own. This is in part due to the poverty of endemic areas as well as the parasite's complex life cycle, which includes transmission by freshwater snails and livestock. A more comprehensive disease control strategy would include periodic treatment and vaccination of the widely used domestic water buffalo or carabao. Sociocultural and behavioral research would also inform and improve the impact of future control programs. To this end, we investigated knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to schistosomiasis in an endemic village in Leyte, Philippines. We found high levels of disease knowledge and awareness, but also inconsistencies in disease prevention habits. Belief in whether schistosomiasis could be prevented was important in this community, associated with previous disease experience as well as receptivity to new strategies like livestock vaccination. This kind of social context is vital to future public health campaigns, and highlights the importance of cross-disciplinary work to achieve successful disease control.

AB Background Taenia solium is a neglected zoonotic parasite endemic throughout many low-income countries worldwide, including Zambia, where it causes human and pig diseases with high health and socioeconomic burdens. Lack of knowledge is a recognized risk factor, and consequently targeted health educational programs can decrease parasite transmission and disease occurrence in endemic areas. Preliminary assessment of the computer-based education program The Vicious Worm' in rural areas of eastern Zambia indicated that it was effective at increasing knowledge of T. solium in primary school students. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of The Vicious Worm' on knowledge retention by re-assessing the same primary school students one year after the initial education workshops.
   Methodology/Principal findings Follow-up questionnaires were administered in the original three primary schools in eastern Zambia in 2017, 12 months after the original workshops. In total, 86 pupils participated in the follow-up sessions, representing 87% of the initial workshop respondents. Knowledge of T. solium at follow-up' was significantly higher than at the initial pre' questionnaire administered during the Vicious Worm workshop that took place one year earlier. While some specifics of the parasite's life cycle were not completely understood, the key messages for disease prevention, such as the importance of hand washing and properly cooking pork, remained well understood by the students, even one year later.
   Conclusions/Significance Results of this study indicate that The Vicious Worm' may be an effective tool for both short- and long-term T. solium education of rural primary school students in Zambia. Inclusion of educational workshops using The Vicious Worm' could be recommended for integrated cysticercosis control/elimination programs in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly if the content is simplified to focus on the key messages for prevention of disease transmission.
   Author summary The zoonotic parasite Taenia solium, commonly known as the pork tapeworm, causes substantial public health and economic losses worldwide. It is commonly found in low-income countries where pigs are raised in areas of poor sanitation, including Zambia. The links between the parasite and its different disease forms in humans and pigs are not very well known, and ignorance of the parasite is a known risk factor for infection. Health education can significantly increase knowledge and awareness of the parasite and can inspire behavioral change that reduces disease transmission. The Vicious Worm' is a computer-based program designed to provide T. solium education in a fun and interactive way. We conducted educational workshops in three primary schools in rural areas of eastern Zambia, and preliminary assessment indicated that the Vicious Worm' educational content significantly improved students' knowledge of T. solium. We also conducted follow-up studies in the same students one year later, and discovered that the students' knowledge was still significantly higher than at baseline. We conclude that The Vicious Worm' may be a useful educational component to enable targeting of school students, and would recommend its inclusion in integrated T. solium control programs in future.

AB Background Anisakiasis is an emerging public health problem, caused by Anisakis spp. nematode larvae. Anisakiasis presents as variable and unspecific gastrointestinal and/or allergic clinical symptoms, which accounts for the high rate of misdiagnosed cases.
   Methodology/Principal findings The aim of this study was to characterize the early cellular (6-72 h p.i.) and molecular (6 h p.i.) immune response and general underlying regulatory mechanism in Anisakis infected rats. Each Sprague-Dawley rat was infected with 10 Anisakis spp. larvae by gastric intubation. Tissues with visible lesions were processed for: i) classic histopathology (HE), immunofluorescence (CD3, iNOS, S100A8/A9), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM); ii) target genes (Il1b, Il6, Il18, Ccl3, Icam1, Mmp9) and microRNA (Rat Immunopathology MIRN-104ZF plate, Quiagen) expression analysis; and iii) global DNA methylation. Histopathology revealed that Anisakis larval migration caused moderate to extensive hemorrhages in submucosal and epimysial/perimysial connective tissue. In stomach and muscle, moderate to abundant mixed inflammatory infiltrate was present, dominated by neutrophils and macrophages, while only mild infiltration was seen in intestine. Lesions were characterized by the presence of CD3(+), iNOS(+), and S100A8/A9(+) cells. The greatest number of iNOS(+) and S100A8/A9(+) cells was seen in muscle. Il6, Il1b, and Ccl3 showed particularly strong expression in stomach and visceral adipose tissues, but the order of expression differed between tissues. In total, three miRNAs were differentially expressed, two in stomach (miRNA-451 and miRNA-223) and two in intestine (miRNA-451 and miRNA-672). No changes in global DNA methylation were observed in infected tissues relative to controls.
   Conclusions/Significance Anisakis infection induces strong immune responses in infected rats with marked induction of specific proinflammatory cytokines and miRNA expression. Deciphering the functional role of these cytokines and miRNAs will help in understanding the anisakiasis pathology and controversies surrounding Anisakis infection in humans.
   Author summary Anisakiasis is a zoonotic disease (infection transmitted between animals and humans) contracted by consumption of raw or undercooked seafood contaminated with Anisakis spp. nematode larvae. Anisakiasis usually presents with variable and unspecific gastrointestinal and/or allergic symptoms, which accounts for the high rate of misdiagnosed cases. Due to changes in dietary habits, such as eating raw or undercooked seafood, anisakiasis is considered an emerging public health problem. Despite the increase in number of reported cases worldwide, mechanisms of immune response to this unspecific human pathogen are poorly known. We have shown that in experimentally infected rats, Anisakis larvae cause severe hemorrhages and necrotic changes of affected tissues in the early phase of infections. Neutrophils and macrophages were abundantly present in tissue lesions, while eosinophils, hallmark of helminth infections, were scarcely present. We have also demonstrated particularly strong expression of several inflammatory genes. Moreover, we give for the first-time insight into putative regulatory mechanism mediated via a distinct class of RNA molecules. Our study may provide new opportunities for better understanding of cellular and molecular response to Anisakis spp., aiming at development of more specific therapeutics and alleviation of pathologies associated with Anisakis spp. infection.

AB Background The Zanzibar Elimination of Schistosomiasis Transmission (ZEST) project aimed to eliminate urogenital schistosomiasis as a public health problem from Pemba and to interrupt Schistosoma haematobium transmission from Unguja in 5 years.
   Methodology A repeated cross-sectional cluster-randomized trial was implemented from 2011/12 till 2017. On each island, 45 shehias were randomly assigned to receive one of three interventions: biannual mass drug administration (MDA) with praziquantel alone, or in combination with snail control or behavior change measures. In cross-sectional surveys, a single urine sample was collected from 9,000 students aged 9- to 12-years and from 4,500 adults aged 20- to 55-years annually, and from 9,000 1(st) year students at baseline and the final survey. Each sample was examined for S. haematobium eggs by a single urine filtration. Prevalence and infection intensity were determined. Odds of infection were compared between the intervention arms.
   Principal findings Prevalence was reduced from 6.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.5%-7.6%) to 1.7% (95% CI: 1.2%-2.2%) in 9- to 12-year old students, from 3.9% (95% CI: 2.8%-5.0%) to 1.5% (95% CI: 1.0%-2.0%) in adults, and from 8.8% (95% CI: 6.5%-11.2%) to 2.6% (95% CI: 1.7%-3.5%) in 1(st) year students from 2011/12 to 2017. In 2017, heavy infection intensities occurred in 0.4% of 9- to 12-year old students, 0.1% of adults, and 0.8% of 1(st) year students. Considering 1(st) year students in 2017, 13/45 schools in Pemba and 4/45 schools in Unguja had heavy infection intensities >1%. There was no significant difference in prevalence between the intervention arms in any study group and year.
   Conclusions/Significance Urogenital schistosomiasis was eliminated as public health problem from most sites in Pemba and Unguja. Prevalence was significantly reduced, but transmission was not interrupted. Continued interventions that are adaptive and tailored to the micro-epidemiology of S. haematobium in Zanzibar are needed to sustain and advance the gains made by ZEST.
   Author summary Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by parasitic blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma. The highest burden is concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa. On the Zanzibar islands, urogenital schistosomiasis has been successfully controlled over the past decades. The Zanzibar Elimination of Schistosomiasis Transmission (ZEST) project implemented from 2011/12 through 2017 aimed to eliminate urogenital schistosomiasis as a public health problem from Pemba and to interrupt S. haematobium transmission from Unguja in 5 years. In a cluster-randomized trial, we investigated the impact of biannual treatment of the population with praziquantel alone or combined with snail control or behavior change interventions. After five years of interventions, the overall S. haematobium prevalence was reduced to <3% in schoolchildren and adults. Heavy infection intensities were observed in <1% of the surveyed population groups. Urogenital schistosomiasis was eliminated as a public health problem from most of the study sites on Pemba and Unguja. The prevalence was significantly lower in 2017 compared with 2011/12, but transmission was not interrupted. To sustain and advance the gains made by ZEST, continued interventions that are adaptive and tailored to the micro-epidemiology of S. haematobium in Zanzibar are needed.

SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID TABLES
AB Background Leptospirosis is a bacterial zoonotic disease of worldwide importance, though relatively neglected in many African countries including sub Saharan Africa that is among areas with high burden of this disease. The disease is often mistaken for other febrile illnesses such as dengue, malaria, rickettsioses and enteric fever. Leptospirosis is an occupational disease likely to affect people working in environments prone to infestation with rodents which are the primary reservoir hosts of this disease. Some of the populations at risk include: sugarcane plantation workers, wetland farmers, fishermen and abattoir workers. In this study we investigated the prevalence of antibodies against Leptospira among sugarcane plantation and factory workers, fishing communities as well as among rodents and shrews in domestic and peridomestic environments within the study areas.
   Methods The study was conducted in Kagera region, northwestern Tanzania and it involved sugarcane plantation workers (cutters and weeders), sugar factory workers and the fishing community at Kagera Sugar Company in Missenyi district and Musira island in Lake Victoria, Kagera, respectively. Blood was collected from consenting human adults, and from rodents and shrews (insectivores) captured live using Sherman traps. Serological detection of leptospiral antibodies in blood serum was carried out by the microscopic agglutination test (MAT).
   Results A total of 455 participants were recruited from the sugarcane plantation (n = 401) and fishing community (n = 54) while 31 rodents and shrews were captured. The overall prevalence of antibodies against Leptospira in human was 15.8%. Sugarcane cutters had higher seroprevalence than other sugar factory workers. Prevalent antibodies against Leptospira serovars in humans were against serovars Lora (6.8%), Sokoine (5.3%), Pomona (2.4%), Hebdomadis (1.1%) and Kenya (0.2%). Detected leptospiral serovars in reservoir hosts were Sokoine (12.5%) and Grippotyphosa (4.2%). Serovar Sokoine was detected both in humans and small mammals.
   Conclusion Leptospirosis is a public health threat affecting populations at risk, such as sugarcane plantation workers and fishing communities. Public awareness targeting risk occupational groups is much needed for mitigation of leptospirosis in the study areas and other vulnerable populations in Tanzania and elsewhere.
   Author summary Leptospirosis is caused by a spirochete bacterium of the genus Leptospira. The disease is worldwide distributed, although highly neglected in some parts of the developing world. This study investigated the prevalence of antibodies against Leptospira in sugarcane plantation workers, a fishing community and rodents and shrews in the Kagera region, northwestern Tanzania. Seventy two of the 455 (15.8%) screened participants were seropositive to leptospirosis. The seroprevalence was higher among sugarcane cutters (18.4%) than other plantation workers, and 15.4% of hospitalized patients in the plantation hospital were seropositive. Prevalence of antibodies against Leptospira in the fishing community was 14.8%. Antibodies against Leptospira serovars detected in humans with their respective proportions, in brackets, were Lora (6.8%), Sokoine (5.3%), Pomona (2.4%), Hebdomadis (1.1%) and Kenya (0.2%). In the small mammals, the most detected antibodies were against Leptospira serovar Sokoine (12.5%) and serovar Grippotyphosa (4.2%). These results show that leptospirosis is public health risk requiring attention of the health system as well as the agricultural sector for its management.

AB Season is a major determinant of infectious disease rates, including arboviruses spread by mosquitoes, such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. Seasonal patterns of disease are driven by a combination of climatic or environmental factors, such as temperature or rainfall, and human behavioral time trends, such as school year schedules, holidays, and weekday-weekend patterns. These factors affect both disease rates and healthcare-seeking behavior. Seasonality of dengue fever has been studied in the context of climatic factors, but short- and long-term time trends are less well-understood. With 2009-2016 medical record data from patients diagnosed with dengue fever at two hospitals in rural Ecuador, we used Poisson generalized linear modeling to determine short- and long-term seasonal patterns of dengue fever, as well as the effect of day of the week and public holidays. In a subset analysis, we determined the impact of school schedules on school-aged children. With a separate model, we examined the effect of climate on diagnosis patterns. In the first model, the most important predictors of dengue fever were annual sinusoidal fluctuations in disease, long-term trends (as represented by a spline for the full study duration), day of the week, and hospital. Seasonal trends showed single peaks in case diagnoses, during mid-March. Compared to the average of all days, cases were more likely to be diagnosed on Tuesdays (risk ratio (RR): 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.51) and Thursdays (RR: 1.25, 95% CI 1.02-1.53), and less likely to be diagnosed on Saturdays (RR: 0.81, 95% CI 0.65-1.01) and Sundays (RR: 0.74, 95% CI 0.58-0.95). Public holidays were not significant predictors of dengue fever diagnoses, except for an increase in diagnoses on the day after Christmas (RR: 2.77, 95% CI 1.46-5.24). School schedules did not impact dengue diagnoses in school-aged children. In the climate model, important climate variables included the monthly total precipitation, an interaction between total precipitation and monthly absolute minimum temperature, an interaction between total precipitation and monthly precipitation days, and a three-way interaction between minimum temperature, total precipitation, and precipitation days. This is the first report of long-term dengue fever seasonality in Ecuador, one of few reports from rural patients, and one of very few studies utilizing daily disease reports. These results can inform local disease prevention efforts, public health planning, as well as global and regional models of dengue fever trends.
   Author summary Dengue fever exhibits a seasonal pattern in many parts of the world, much of which has been attributed to climate and weather. However, additional factors may contribute to dengue seasonality. With 2009-2016 medical record data from rural Ecuador, we studied the short- and long-term seasonal patterns of dengue fever, as well as the effect of school schedules and public holidays. We also examined the effect of climate on dengue. We found that dengue diagnoses peak once per year in mid-March, but that diagnoses are also affected by day of the week. Dengue was also impacted by regional climate and complex interactions between local weather variables. This is the first report of long-term dengue fever seasonality in Ecuador, one of few reports from rural patients, and one of very few studies utilizing daily disease reports. This is the first report on the impacts of school schedules, holidays, and weekday-weekend patterns on dengue diagnoses. These results suggest a potential impact of human behaviors on dengue exposure risk. More broadly, these results can inform local disease prevention efforts and public health planning, as well as global and regional models of dengue fever trends.

AB Oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) are being increasingly employed, but current killed formulations generally require multiple doses and lack efficacy in young children. We recently developed a new live-attenuated OCV candidate (HaitiV) derived from a Vibrio cholerae strain isolated during the 2010 Haiti cholera epidemic. HaitiV exhibited an unexpected probiotic-like activity in infant rabbits, preventing intestinal colonization and disease by wild-type V. cholerae before the onset of adaptive immunity. However, it remained unknown whether HaitiV would behave similarly to other OCVs to stimulate adaptive immunity against V. cholerae. Here, we orally immunized adult germ-free female mice to test HaitiV's immunogenicity. HaitiV safely and stably colonized vaccinated mice and induced known adaptive immune correlates of cholera protection within 14 days of administration. Pups born to immunized mice were protected against lethal challenges of both homologous and heterologous V. cholerae strains. Cross-fostering experiments revealed that protection was not dependent on vaccine colonization in or transmission to the pups. These findings demonstrate the protective immunogenicity of HaitiV and support its development as a new tool for limiting cholera.
   Author summary Oral cholera vaccines are increasingly used as public health tools for prevention of cholera and curtailing the spread of outbreaks. However, current killed vaccines provide minimal protection in young children, who are especially susceptible to this diarrheal disease, and require similar to 7-14 days between vaccination and development of protective immunity. We recently created HaitiV, a live-attenuated oral cholera vaccine candidate derived from a clinical isolate from the Haiti cholera outbreak. Unexpectedly, HaitiV protected against cholera-like illness in infant rabbits within 24 hours of administration, before the onset of adaptive immunity. However, HaitiV's capacity to stimulate adaptive immune responses against the cholera pathogen were not investigated. Here, we report that HaitiV induces immunological correlates of protection against cholera in adult germ-free mice and leads to protection against disease in their offspring. Protection against disease was transferable through the milk of the immunized mice and was not due to transmission or colonization of HaitiV in this model. Coupling the immunogenicity data presented here with our previous observation that HaitiV can protect from cholera prior to the induction of adaptive immunity, we propose that HaitiV may provide both rapid-onset short-term protection from disease while eliciting stable and long-lasting immunity against cholera.

AB Background Brucellosis is regarded as a major zoonotic infection worldwide. Awareness and knowledge of brucellosis among occupational workers is considered an important aspect of brucellosis control in both humans and animals. The aim of this study was to explore the distributions of the pooled awareness level and the knowledge level of the disease worldwide.
   Methods A meta-analysis was carried out to obtain pooled brucellosis awareness levels and knowledge levels of respondents regarding the zoonotic nature of brucellosis, mode of brucellosis transmission, and brucellosis symptoms in animals and humans. The analysis was conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses guidelines.
   Results A total of seventy-nine original articles reporting the brucellosis awareness levels of in populations from 22 countries were assessed. The total pooled awareness level of brucellosis was 55.5%, and the pooled awareness levels regarding the zoonotic nature of brucellosis, mode of brucellosis transmission, signs of human brucellosis and signs of animal brucellosis were 37.6%, 35.9%, 41.6%, and 28.4% respectively. The pooled awareness level was higher than the brucellosis-related knowledge level. Subgroup analyses showed that no obvious differences in brucellosis awareness levels between high-risk populations in Asia and Africa. Health workers (including human health workers and veterinarians) had the greatest overall awareness and knowledge of human brucellosis. The overall awareness levels and knowledge levels of livestock owners (farmers) and herders were higher than those of dairy farmers and abattoir workers. In addition, awareness and knowledge levels were higher among people who were involved in bovine, caprine and ovine animal production or in caprine and ovine animal production than among people who were involved in only bovine animal production.
   Conclusions Insufficient awareness and knowledge of brucellosis were observed in the original studies conducted mainly in Asia and Africa. Interventions to improve public knowledge about brucellosis are urgently needed.
   Author summary Brucellosis is considered a neglected zoonotic disease that creates a very large obstacle to the development of animal production and is a great threat to human health. High brucellosis awareness and knowledge is critical for the implementation of correct practices and habits and consequently the control and prevention of brucellosis. The aim of this study was to estimate the awareness and knowledge of brucellosis, specifically regarding its zoonotic nature, mode of transmission, and signs in humans and in animals as well as awareness information sources. To this end, a meta-analysis of data from 79 studies was performed. The included studies on the awareness and knowledge of brucellosis were mainly from Africa and Asia. There were no significant differences in the awareness levels of brucellosis among high-risk groups in Asia and Africa. Overall, people's awareness and knowledge of brucellosis were low and insufficient. Health workers had the highest pooled levels of awareness and knowledge regarding brucellosis. In addition, livestock stock owners (farmers) had notably higher awareness and knowledge levels than dairy farmers and abattoir workers. Neighbors and friends were the most common sources of brucellosis information for farmers. The low and insufficient awareness and knowledge about brucellosis is an obstacle for public health. Raising awareness and increasing detailed knowledge of brucellosis are of great significance for the control of brucellosis and the protection of human health. The potential of the media and health workers in the dissemination of knowledge about the disease needs to be fostered.

AB Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease that is caused by a novel bunyavirus SFTSV. Currently our knowledge of the host-related factors that influence the pathogenesis of disease is inadequate to allow prediction of fatal outcome. Here we conducted a prospective study of the largest database on the SFTS patients, to identify the presence of comorbidities in SFTS, and estimate their effect on the fatal outcome. Among 2096 patients eligible for inclusion, we identified nine kinds of comorbidities, from which hyperlipidemia (12.2%; 95% CI: 10.8%-13.6%), hypertension (11.0%; 95% CI: 9.6%-12.3%), chronic viral hepatitis (CVH) (9.3%; 95% CI: 8.1%-10.5%), and diabetes mellitus (DM) (6.8%; 95% CI: 5.7%-7.9%) were prevalent. Higher risk of death was found in patients with DM (adjusted OR = 2.304; 95% CI: 1.520-3.492; P<0.001), CVH (adjusted OR = 1.551; 95% CI: 1.053-2.285; P = 0.026) and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) (adjusted OR = 2.170; 95% CI: 1.215-3.872; P = 0.009) after adjusting for age, sex, delay from disease onset to admission and treatment regimens. When analyzing the comorbidities separately, we found that the high serum glucose could augment diseases severity. Compared to the group with max glucose < 7.0 mmol/L, patients with glucose between 7.0-11.1 mmol/L and glucose 11.1 mmol/L conferred higher death risk, with the adjusted OR to be 1.467 (95% CI: 1.081-1.989; P = 0.014) and 3.443 (95% CI: 2.427-4.884; P<0.001). Insulin therapy could effectively reduce the risk of severe outcome in DM patients with the adjusted OR 0.146 (95% CI: 0.058-0.365; P<0.001). For CVH patients, severe damage of liver and prolongation of blood coagulation time, as well as high prevalence of bleeding phenotype were observed. These data supported the provocative hypothesis that treating SFTS related complications can attain potentially beneficial effects on SFTS.
   Author summary SFTS now brings about a substantial global public health concern. Preexisting chronic conditions were thought to increase risk of severe SFTSV infections, however with sparse data mining efforts. In this study, we quantified the frequency of chronic comorbidities in SFTS, estimated their contribution to disease severity, and separately evaluated the effect from diabetes mellitus and chronic viral hepatitis on resulting in fatal outcome.

AB Background Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), an infectious disease caused by hantaviruses, is endemic in China and remains a serious public health problem. Historically, Shandong Province has had the largest HFRS burden in China. However, we do not have a comprehensive and clear understanding of the current epidemic foci of HFRS in Shandong Province.
   Methodology/principal findings The incidence and mortality rates were calculated, and a phylogenetic analysis was performed after laboratory testing of the virus in rodents. Spatial epidemiology analysis was applied to investigate the epidemic foci, including their sources. A total of 6,206 HFRS cases and 59 related deaths were reported in Shandong Province. The virus carriage rates of the rodents Rattus norvegicus, Apodemus agrarius and Mus musculus were 10.24%, 6.31% and 0.27%, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that two novel viruses obtained from R. norvegicus in Anqiu City and Qingzhou City were dissimilar to the other strains, but closely related to strains previously isolated in northeastern China. Three epidemic foci were defined, two of which were derived from the Jining and Linyi epidemic foci, respectively, while the other was the residue of the Jining epidemic focus.
   Conclusions/significance The southeastern and central Shandong Province are current key HFRS epidemic foci dominated by A. agrarius and R. norvegicus, respectively. Our study could help local departments to strengthen prevention and control measures in key areas to reduce the hazards of HFRS.
   Author summary Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a global infectious disease, which is still a serious public health threat in China today. The reported HFRS cases in Shandong Province accounted for approximate one third of total cases in the whole country. HFRS is a zoonosis mainly caused by Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Seoul virus (SEOV), which natural rodent hosts are A. agrarius and R. norvegicus, respectively. To explore the current HFRS epidemic foci based on patients, rodents and molecular epidemiology characteristics in Shandong Province, we collected the records of HFRS cases from whole province and the rodents captured in 14 surveillance sites. We found that the epidemic situation of HFRS is quiet different in temporal and spatial distribution. Three epidemic foci were defined based on patients, rodents and molecular epidemiology characteristics. The situation of HFRS epidemic foci in Shandong Province was clear. Our study provides a reference for relevant departments to develop key prevention strategies.

AB Rapid point-of-care resistance diagnostics (POC-RD) are a key tool in the fight against antibiotic resistance. By tailoring drug choice to infection genotype, doctors can improve treatment efficacy while limiting costs of inappropriate antibiotic prescription. Here, we combine epidemiological theory and data to assess the potential of resistance diagnostics (RD) innovations in a public health context, as a means to limit or even reverse selection for antibiotic resistance. POC-RD can be used to impose a nonbiological fitness cost on resistant strains by enabling diagnostic-informed treatment and targeted interventions that reduce resistant strains' opportunities for transmission. We assess this diagnostic-imposed fitness cost in the context of a spectrum of bacterial population biologies and find that POC-RD have a greater potential against obligate pathogens than opportunistic pathogens already subject to selection under bystander antibiotic exposure during asymptomatic carriage (e.g., the pneumococcus). We close by generalizing the notion of RD-informed strategies to incorporate carriage surveillance information and illustrate that coupling transmission-control interventions to the discovery of resistant strains in carriage can potentially select against resistance in a broad range of opportunistic pathogens.

AB Illicit use of psychostimulants, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, constitutes a significant public health problem. Whereas neural mechanisms that mediate the effects of these drugs are well-characterized, genetic factors that account for individual variation in susceptibility to substance abuse and addiction remain largely unknown. Drosophila melanogaster can serve as a translational model for studies on substance abuse, since flies have a dopamine transporter that can bind cocaine and methamphetamine, and exposure to these compounds elicits effects similar to those observed in people, suggesting conserved evolutionary mechanisms underlying drug responses. Here, we used the D. melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel to investigate the genetic basis for variation in psychostimulant drug consumption, to determine whether similar or distinct genetic networks underlie variation in consumption of cocaine and methamphetamine, and to assess the extent of sexual dimorphism and effect of genetic context on variation in voluntary drug consumption. Quantification of natural genetic variation in voluntary consumption, preference, and change in consumption and preference over time for cocaine and methamphetamine uncovered significant genetic variation for all traits, including sex-, exposure- and drug-specific genetic variation. Genome wide association analyses identified both shared and drug-specific candidate genes, which could be integrated in genetic interaction networks. We assessed the effects of ubiquitous RNA interference (RNAi) on consumption behaviors for 34 candidate genes: all affected at least one behavior. Finally, we utilized RNAi knockdown in the nervous system to implicate dopaminergic neurons and the mushroom bodies as part of the neural circuitry underlying experience-dependent development of drug preference.

AB This cross-sectional study aimed at evaluating the knowledge and attitudes concerning influenza vaccination in Southern Italy, and investigating the potential determinants of vaccine uptake. The sample consisted of 700 adults (mean age 58.7y) with chronic diseases attending four public specialty clinics in Italy. Overall, 64.7% of the participants were aware that influenza can be prevented with vaccines and that patients with chronic diseases are at higher risk of developing severe complications. Less than half of the sample (42.1%) received influenza vaccine in the last season, and 46.9% declared the will to receive influenza vaccination in the next season. The level of awareness was significantly lower among the elderly (> = 65y) and those with a higher self-reported health. A significantly higher likelihood of vaccination was observed among the elderly, the subjects with a higher knowledge about vaccine utility and safety, the participants with chronic respiratory diseases, and those who had taken more drugs. Future education programs and communication strategies are strongly needed in adults with chronic diseases to improve influenza vaccination knowledge and uptake.

TI Pilots and athletes: Different concerns, similar concussion
   non-disclosure
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYERS; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; ICE HOCKEY; EDUCATION;
   KNOWLEDGE; SYMPTOMS; GENDER; NORMS; RISK; ATTITUDES
AB Objectives
   Concussion non-disclosure research has focused almost exclusively on athletes. The focus on athletic populations has been sensible considering athletes' demonstrated susceptibility to sustaining and concealing concussions. Nevertheless, the habitual use of athletic populations has allowed researchers and practitioners to omit the development of generalized perceived costs and perceived rewards as critical determinants of concussion self-disclosure. We hypothesized that perceiving concussion disclosure as generally more costly than rewarding would predict negative attitudes towards disclosure and decreased intent to disclose. We also hypothesized that generalized perceived costs and rewards could explain concussion non-disclosure in different populations, athletes and future pilots specifically, even when those populations perceive concussion self-disclosure as costly for different specific reasons.
   Methods
   We examined concussion disclosure using 2,504 cadets at the United States Air Force Academy. Cadets completed anonymous surveys assessing their intention to self-disclose undiagnosed concussions (Anticipated Concussion Disclosure) as well as several variables potentially related to concussion self-disclosure: perceived cost, perceived reward, personal identity, attitudes, normative behavior, social support, and self-efficacy.
   Results
   The results demonstrate that concussion non-disclosure develops when a population perceives disclosure as more costly (i.e. directly or emotionally) and less rewarding. Perceived Cost and Perceived Reward variables alone accounted for 50% of the variance in Anticipated Conclusion Disclosure (Adjusted R-2 = 0.50, F(2,2312) = 1,145.31, p < 0.001). As expected, Anticipated Conclusion Disclosure developed for different reasons within different sub-populations. Consistent with existing research, cadet intercollegiate athletes reported being primarily concerned that concussion self-disclosure would cause them to miss practice or game time (t (736.7) = 14.20, p <.001, Cohen's d = 0.96). In contrast, cadet future pilots reported being primarily concerned that concussion self-disclosure would have negative United States Air Force career repercussions (t (1828) = 10.25, p < .001, Cohen's d = 0.50).
   Conclusions
   These results suggest that cultures of concussion non-disclosure can develop in any population where disclosure is perceived as having undesirable consequences, not just athletic populations. Concussion researchers and practitioners should devote more attention to the perceived cost-benefit structures that create concussion non-disclosure to address this crucial public health issue more effectively.

TI Intimate partner violence and its associated factors among pregnant
   women in Bale Zone, Southeast Ethiopia: A cross-sectional study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; PREVALENCE
AB Background
   Intimate partner violence (IPV) against women is a major public health concern in low income countries. Violence against pregnant women has adverse effects on maternal and newborn outcomes. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of intimate partner violence in Southeast Ethiopia pregnant women.
   Methods
   Institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted on pregnant women who were attending antenatal care (ANC) in Bale Zone health institution during study period. Face to face interviews were conducted using a pre-tested structured questionnaire. Data related to socio-demographic characteristic, pregnancy and reproductive history, intimate partner behavior and IPV encountered during recent pregnancy was gathered for this study. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression were used for the data analysis. Odds ratio with 95% CI was computed to determine the presence and strength of associated factors with IPV.
   Results
   A total of 612 pregnant women participated in the study. Of these, 361 (59.0%) pregnant women faced at least one type of IPV during the recent pregnancy. Physical violence (20.3%), sexual violence (36.3%), psychological/emotional violence (33.0), controlling behavior violence (30.4%) and economic violence (27.0) were the type of IPV encountered by participants. An intimate partners who were drank alcohol [AOR = 2.9; 95% CI: (1.5-5.4)], partners who were chewed Khat [AOR = 1.7; 95% CI: (1.1-2.6)], partners who were smoked cigarette [AOR = 2.6; 95% CI: (1.4-4.9)], partners who had aggressive behavior [AOR = 2.8; 95% CI: (1.7-4.6)], having partner age >= 30 year old [AOR = 1.8; 95% CI: (1.2-2.9)], unwanted pregnancy [AOR = 3.3; 95% CI: (1.9-5.5)] and history of adverse pregnancy outcome [AOR = 2.1; 95% CI: (1.2-3.6)] that were the factors that significantly associated with IPV of the pregnant women.
   Conclusion
   The prevalence of IPV during pregnancy was high among the study participants. Intimate partners' use of substance, intimate partners' aggressive behavior, older intimate partners, unwanted pregnancy and history of adverse birth outcome were identified as associated factors for IPV. IPV needs to be considered during ANC service and integrated into the sexual and reproductive health education. Community-based interventions should be advocated as a way of health promotion. Counseling, awareness creation, service provision and program design on IPV is mandatory to minimize the victim.

TI Incidence and predictors of treatment failure among children on
   first-line antiretroviral therapy in Amhara Region Referral Hospitals,
   northwest Ethiopia 2018: A retrospective study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID HIV-POSITIVE CHILDREN; VIROLOGICAL FAILURE
AB Background
   Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a major public health concern globally, especially in sub-Saharan African countries. Even though determining the incidence of treatment failure and its predictor is a crucial step to reduce the problem, there is limited information indicating the incidence and predictors of treatment failure among children in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the incidence and predictors of treatment failure among children on first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Amhara Region referral hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia.
   Methods
   An institution-based retrospective follow-up study was conducted from January 30, 2011, to January 30, 2018. A total of 402 children on first-line antiretroviral therapy were selected with a simple random sampling method in Amhara Region Referral Hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia. Data were extracted by reviewing patients' ART intake and follow-up forms using pretested and structured checklists. The collected data were entered into Epidata Version 4.2 and analysis was done using STATA Version 13. Bivariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were fitted to identify predictors of treatment failure.
   Results
   A total of 402 records of children on antiretroviral therapy (ART) were reviewed and treatment failures rate within the follow-up period were 12.19% (95% CI: 8.5, 15.88). This study also found that the overall incidence density rate was 3.77% per 100 person-years observation. Virologic failure accounts 48.98% followed by immunologic (28.57%) and mixed failures (22.44%). Poor ART adherence (AHR: 4.6, 95% CI: 1.61, 13.20), drug regimens, AZT-3TC-NVP (AHR: 5.2, 95% CI: 1.9, 14.26), and AZT-3TC-EFV (AHR: 6.26, 95% CI: 1.88, 20.87), Children whose both parent were died (AHR: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.07, 7.37) and world health organization (WHO) clinical stage-4 (AHR: 2.95, 95% CI: 1.04, 8.366) were found to be predictors for treatment failure among children.
   Conclusion
   The proportion of treatment failure among children on first-line ART in Amhara Region referral hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia was found to be high. Nearly half of the children experienced Virologic failure. Poor ART adherence, children whose parents' died without parents, WHO clinical stage-4 at baseline and type of regimen patients took were found to be predictors of first-line ART treatment failure. Therefore, expanding access to routine viral load, CD4 and clinical monitoring is mandatory to detect and early intervene of treatment failures' to improve outcomes for children on ART. Patient caregivers or parents should strictly support children on medication adherence. Training to health professionals should be given time-based on revised guidelines, and follow up of treatment outcome should be monitored nationally to take the appropriate intervention.

TI Identifying anomalous nuclear radioactive sources using Poisson kriging
   and mobile sensor networks
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Nuclear security is a critical concept for public health, counter-terrorism efforts, and national security. Nuclear radioactive materials should be monitored and secured in near real-time to reduce potential danger of malicious usage. However, several challenges have arose to detect the anomalous radioactive source in a large geographical area. Radiation naturally occurs in the environment. Therefore, a non-zero level of radiation will always exist with or without an anomalous radioactive source present. Additionally, radiation data contain high levels of uncertainty, meaning that the measured radiation value is significantly affected by the velocity of the detector and background noise. In this article, we propose an innovative approach to detect anomalous radiation source using mobile sensor networks combined with a Poisson kriging technique. We validate our results using several experiments with simulated radioactive sources. As results, the accuracy of the model is extremely high when the source intensity is high or the anomalous source is close enough to the detector.

AB Canine cutaneous leishmaniasis (CCL) is a zoonosis of public health interest, and in the Americas, Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis has been identified as the main etiological agent. The present study sought to investigate Leishmania spp. infection in domestic dogs from a rural area of the Xapuri municipality, Acre state, Brazilian Amazonia. For this purpose, visits were carried out to domiciles where the human cases of American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) occurred, followed by the clinical evaluation of the animals in search of clinical signs suggestive of CCL. Blood samples were collected from 40 dogs, 13 of which had lesions suggestive of CCL, and biopsies of these lesions were performed. The methods used were Neal, Novy, and Nicolle's (NNN) medium cultures and direct parasitological examination. Further, to detect and characterize Leishmania DNA some molecular techniques were performed such as conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing targeting SSU rDNA and ITS1, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and high resolution melting (HRM) analysis targeting hsp70. The investigation revealed that the results obtained from the parasitological methods were negative. In PCR by ITS1 and network topology sequences, six strains from dogs, isolated from the Peruvian Andes, appeared identical to Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis type 2 (99-100%). By other molecular methods these samples turned out to be positive to Leishmania (Viannia) sp.. The diagnosis of Leishmania in domestic dogs from Acre state showed a high proportion of infected animals, and the occurrence of L. braziliensis type 2 in Brazil for the first time. This new report suggests that L. braziliensis type 2 is both trans-and cis-Andean. However, more studies are needed regarding the clinical and diagnostic aspects of this species of Leishmania.

TI Health professionals' willingness to pay and associated factors for
   cervical cancer screening program at College of Medicine and Health
   Sciences, University of Gondar, Northwest Ethiopia
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID RISK
AB Introduction
   Cervical cancer is a major public health problem in developing countries like Ethiopia. Cervical cancer screening service has been offered to high-risk groups in Ethiopia since 2013. However, there is no evidence on the willingness to pay for the screening. Therefore, we conducted this study to assess the female health professionals' willingness to pay for cervical cancer screening at the College of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Gondar, Northwest Ethiopia.
   Methods
   Institutional based cross-sectional study design was used to assess the health professionals' willingness to pay for the cervical screening from March to April, 2018. Simple random sampling technique was used to select study participants from a list of female health professionals who has been working for the College of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Gondar. The data were entered into EpiData version 3.1 and exported to STATA version 14 for analysis. Tobit models were used to identify factors which had statistical significant association with willingness to pay for cervical cancer screening service.
   Results
   A total of 392 respondents participated in the study with a response rate of 92.7%. The majority (83.4%) of participants were willing to pay for cervical cancer screening. The average amount of money they were willing to pay was ETB 194.7 (US$7.16) per service. Age. 30 years, educational status, perceived seriousness of cervical cancer, perceived quality of cervical cancer screening service and monthly income were significantly associated with willingness to pay for cervical cancer screening.
   Conclusion
   High proportion of study participants were willing to pay for cervical cancer screening. Therefore, the policy makers can scale-up cervical cancer screening by setting appropriate fee for service charge. They can also raise awareness of cervical cancer and offer quality service in order to increase the benefits of the program.

AB BackgroundTuberculosis (TB) is an important public health issue worldwide. However, evidence concerning the impact of environmental factors on TB is sparse. We performed a retrospective analysis to determine the spatiotemporal trends and geographic variations of, and the factors associated with, the TB prevalence in Inner Mongolia.MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of the epidemiology of TB. A Bayesian spatiotemporal model was used to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution and trends of the TB prevalence. A spatial panel data model was used to identify factors associated with the TB prevalence in the 101 counties of Inner Mongolia, using county-level aggregated data collected by the Inner Mongolia Center for Disease Control and Prevention.ResultsFrom January 2010 to December 2014, 79,466 (6.36) incident TB cases were recorded. The TB prevalence ranged from 4.97 (12,515/25,167,547) in 2014 to 7.49 (18,406/ 24,578,678) in 2010; the majority of TB cases were in males, and in those aged 46-60 years; by occupation, farmers and herdsmen were the most frequently affected. The Bayesian spatiotemporal model showed that the overall TB prevalence decreased linearly from 2010 to 2014 and occupation-stratified analyses yielded similar results, corroborating the reliability of the findings. The decrease of TB prevalence in the central-western and eastern regions was more rapid than that in the overall TB prevalence. A spatial correlation analysis showed spatial clustering of the TB prevalence from 2011 to 2014 (Moran's index >0, P<0.05); in the spatial panel data model, rural residence, birth rate, number of beds, population density, precipitation, air pressure, and sunshine duration were associated with the TB prevalence.ConclusionsThe overall TB prevalence in Inner Mongolia decreased from 2010 to 2014; however, the incidence of TB was high throughout this period. The TB prevalence was influenced by a spatiotemporal interaction effect and was associated with epidemiological, healthcare, and environmental factors.

AB BackgroundSyrians represent the largest group among refugees in Germany. Many of them were exposed to sequential traumatizing events including war, escape and post-migration stressors, which significantly increase the risk to develop symptoms of posttraumatic stress and other mental disorders. However, there is a lack of adequate treatment options for traumatized refugees in Germany. Moreover, their access to psychosocial care is often restricted due to legal regulation, language barriers, and unclear cost coverage. We therefore aim to develop a low-threshold supportive self-help app for Syrian refugees with posttraumatic stress symptoms. By conducting a randomized controlled trial, we further aim to evaluate the apps' efficacy, usability, acceptance, and economic health benefit/cost-effectiveness.MethodsWe will develop a modular, interactive self-help app in Arabic, which will be grounded on cognitive-behavioral models for the treatment of posttraumatic stress. Subsequently, screened positive (i.e., Syrian refugees, 18-65years old, mild to moderate posttraumatic stress symptomatology as quantified by the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale for DSM-5/PDS-5) participants (ideally up to n=234) will be randomly allocated to an intervention (IG) and control group (CG), respectively. Participants in the IG will gain access to the self-help app for one month, while participants in the CG will receive psychoeducational reading material in form of a comprehensive brochure on traumatization and posttraumatic stress. Measurements are scheduled before the intervention (T0), directly after the intervention (T1, one month later) and three months after the intervention (T2). Using linear mixed effect models, we will investigate change in posttraumatic symptomatology. We will also test for changes in secondary outcomes such as depression, anxiety, and quality of life. Moreover, we will inspect the usability and user acceptance of the app. To evaluate the app in terms of its economic health benefit, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be calculated.DiscussionWe plan to make the app freely available to the general public after evaluation. Thus, the app can help to add-on to routine care, which currently lacks sufficient and appropriate treatment options for Syrian refugees.Trial registrationGerman Clinical Trials Register/Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien (DRKS).

AB BackgroundThe relationship of religious affiliation and mental health is complex, and being part of a minority religious group could have negative effects on mental health. In this study, we assessed the association between religious affiliation and major depressive episode (MDE) in older adults (>=60years) from China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia and South Africa.MethodsWe conducted a secondary analysis of data from the Study on global Ageing and adult health (SAGE), with six nationally-representative community-based samples (n=21,410). Religious affiliation was self-reported by participants, and we defined MDE based on ICD-10 classification. We estimated the association of MDE with religious affiliation versus no religious affiliation, and minority versus majority affiliation.ResultsWe observed no association between having a religious affiliation (vs. no affiliation) and the odds of MDE in older adults. In most cases minorities had higher odds of MDE as compared with the majority religion, but the associations were only significant for Muslims in Ghana and for Muslims, Hindus and Other in South Africa.ConclusionsWhile the results were significant only for two countries, we observed higher odds of MDE among minorities in most of them. Older adults who are members of religious minorities might be at risk for mental health problems, and there is a need for public health interventions aimed at them.

AB BackgroundComplementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a rather novel issue within public healthcare and health policy-making. CAM use in Europe is widespread, patient-initiated, and patient-evaluated, and the regulation across countries has been evaluated as disharmonized. CAM users are left in an uncertain position, and patient safety may be threatened. How risk is understood by individuals in health policy-making and clinical encounters involving the use of CAM has not yet been much debated. The aim of this article is to explore and discuss the existence and possible consequences of differing risk understandings among stakeholders maneuvering in the complex landscape of CAM practice and CAM regulation contextualized by European public healthcare systems.MethodsQualitative data were derived from two studies on CAM in European healthcare contexts. Findings from the EU project CAMbrella on legislation and regulation of CAM were mixed with data from an interview study exploring risk understandings, communication, and decision-making among Scandinavian CAM users and their doctors. In a secondary content analysis, we constructed the case Sara as a typology to demonstrate important findings with regard to risk understandings and patient safety involving European citizens' use of CAM in differing contexts.ResultsBy combining and comparing individual and structural perspectives on risk and CAM use, we revealed underexplored gaps in risk understandings among individuals involved in European CAM regulation and legislation, and between CAM users and their medical doctors. This may cause health risks and uncertainties associated with CAM use and regulation. It may also negatively influence doctor-CAM user communication and CAM users' trust in and use of public healthcare.ConclusionAcknowledging implications of stakeholders' differing risk understandings related to CAM use and regulation may positively influence patient safety in European healthcare. Definitions of the concept of risk should include the factors uncertainty and subjectivity to grasp the full picture of possible risks associated with the use of CAM. To transform the findings of this study into practical settings, we introduce sets of questions relevant to operationalize the important question What is risk? in health policy-making, clinical encounters and risk research involving European patients' use of CAM.

AB BackgroundIn developing countries particularly in sub-Saharan Africa trachoma is still a public health concern. Ethiopia is the most affected of all and bears the highest burden of active trachoma. In spite of this, the prevalence of active trachoma among the pastoralist population in Ethiopia not yet disclosed. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of active trachoma and associated risk factors among children in a pastoralist population in Madda Walabu rural district, Ethiopia.MethodsA community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among children in a pastoralist population in Madda Walabu rural district, from May 1 to 30, 2017. A systematic sampling technique was employed to select 409 children's. Simplified WHO classification scheme was used to assess trachoma. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were performed.ResultsA total of 406 children aged 1-9years have participated, 89 (22%) [95%CI: 18.0-25.6%] were positive for active trachoma. Of these cases, 75(84%) had TI alone in one or both eyes, 14(16%) had TF alone in one or both eyes, and none of the children had both TI and TF. The odds of having active trachoma among children from households using river/ponds, unprotected well/spring and rainwater as their source of drinking water were higher than those from households using water from piped or public tap water (AOR:13,95%CI: 2.9, 58.2), (AOR: 6.1, 95%CI:1.0,36.5) and (AOR: 4.8, 95%CI:1.3,17.8) respectively. Children's from households that lacked a latrine (AOR: 2.5, 95% CI: 1.8, 5.3), children who did not wash their face by using soap (AOR: 4.3, 95% CI: 1.8, 10.6) and children from households within 16-30min of water source (AOR: 8.7, 95% CI: 2.20, 34.2) were higher odds of having active trachoma.ConclusionsThe findings of this study revealed that close to one-quarter of the total children screened for trachoma were positive for the disease. The finding implies that trachoma is still a major concern among children of the pastoralist community which demands further attention of the district health office. Again, intervention with the A, F and E components of SAFE strategy is strongly recommended.

TI On the way to Hepatitis C elimination in the Republic of
   Georgia-Barriers and facilitators for people who inject drugs for
   engaging in the treatment program: A formative qualitative study
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID PREVALENCE; VIRUS; CARE
AB Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a significant public health concern worldwide. Georgia is among the countries with a high burden of HCV infection. People who inject drugs (PWID) have the highest burden of infection in Georgia. In 2015, the Government of Georgia, with partners' support, initiated one of the world's first Hepatitis C Elimination Programs. Despite notable progress, challenges to achieving targets persist. This qualitative study is aimed to better understand some of the barriers and facilitators to HCV testing and treatment services for PWID to inform HCV treatment policies and practices. The study instrument examined social, structural, and individual factors influencing HCV testing and treatment practices. We started with key informant interviews to guide the study instrument development and compare the study findings against health care planners' and health care providers' views. Forty PWID with various HCV testing and treatment experiences were recruited through the snowball method. The study found that along with structural factors such as political commitment, co-financing of diagnostic and monitoring tests, and friendly clinic environments, knowledge about HCV infection and elimination program benefits, and support from family and peers also play facilitating roles in accessing testing and treatment services. On the other hand, inability to co-pay for diagnostic tests, fear of side effects associated with treatment, poor knowledge about HCV infection, and lack of social support hampered testing and treatment practices among PWID. Findings from this study are important for increasing the effectiveness of this unique program that targets a population at high risk of HCV infection.

   facilities in Arba Minch town, south Ethiopia - a cross-sectional study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MATERNAL MORTALITY; CARE; DELIVERY
AB Introduction
   Disrespect and abuse of women during childbirth is one of the deterring factors to skilled childbirth utilization, especially in low and middle-income countries.
   Objective
   The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of women's disrespect and abuse during childbirth in public health facilities in Arba Minch town, south Ethiopia.
   Methods
   Institution-based cross-sectional study design was employed at all public health institutions in Arba Minch town, south Ethiopia. A systematic random sampling method was used to include 281 women who had given birth at public health institutions between January 01 and February 28, 2017. Data were collected through face to face interview by four data collectors and they were supervised by the principal investigator during the entire period of data collection. A semi-structured pretested questionnaire was used to collect the data. Epi info version 7.1.2.0 and SPSS version 24 were used to enter and analyze the data, respectively.
   Results
   The overall prevalence of non-respectful care was 98.9%. The women's right to information and informed consent was the most frequently violated right with a prevalence of 92.5% (95% CI: 90.9, 94.1) followed by non-dignified care (36.7, 95% CI: 34.9, 38.5), physical abuse (29.5%, 95% CI: 24.2, 34.8), discrimination (18.1%, 95% CI: 13.6, 22.6), non-confidential care (17.1%, 95% CI: 12.7, 21.5) and abandonment of care (4.3%, 95% CI: 3.1, 5.5). Rural residence, giving birth in the hospital, having no or low educational status and giving birth by cesarean route were factors significantly associated with specific women's rights violations.
   Conclusions and recommendations
   The prevalence of women's disrespect and abuse during childbirth at the health care facilities in this study area is very high. Therefore, health managers need to work hard to tackle the problem.

   facility - based survey
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Telemedicine; Uganda; E-readiness; Health facilities
ID TELEHEALTH; TOOLS
AB BackgroundIn developing countries like Uganda, there are shortages of health workers especially medical specialists. The referral process is frustrating to both patients and health workers (HWs). This is due to delays in accessing laboratory results/tests, costs of travel with resultant delay in consulting specialists. Telemedicine can help reduce these problems. To facilitate successful and sustainable telemedicine implementation the eHealth readiness of different stakeholders should be undertaken. This study was conducted at public health facilities (HFs) in Uganda to assess eHealth readiness across four domains; core, e-learning, clinical and technology, that might hamper adoption and integration of telemedicine.MethodsA cross-sectional study using mixed methods for data collection was conducted at health center IVs, regional and national referral hospitals. The study was conducted in three parts. Quantitative data on core, e-learning and clinical readiness domains were collected from doctors and other healthcare providers (nurses/midwives, public health officers and allied healthcare workers). Respondents were categorised into aware and used telemedicine', aware and not used', unaware of telemedicine'. Focus Group Discussions were conducted with patients to further assess core readiness. Technology readiness was assessed using a questionnaire with purposively selected respondents; directors, heads of medical sections, and hospital managers/superintendents. Descriptive statistics and correlations were performed using Spearman's rank order test for relationship between technology readiness variables at the HFs.Results70% of health professionals surveyed across three levels of HF were aware of telemedicine and 41% had used telemedicine. However, over 40% of HWs at HC-IV and RRH were unaware of telemedicine. All doctors who had used telemedicine were impressed with it. Telemedicine users and non-users who were aware of telemedicine showed core, clinical, and learning readiness. Patients were aware of telemedicine but identified barriers to its use. A weak but positive correlation existed between the different variables in technology readiness.ConclusionRespondents who were aware of and used telemedicine across all HF levels indicated core, learning and clinical readiness for adoption and integration of telemedicine at the public HFs in Uganda, although patients noted potential barriers that might need attention. In terms of technology readiness, gaps still exit at the various HF levels.

ID PERFORMANCE; WORK
AB Concern among the public and policymakers about current and future major staff shortages is increasing. Strengthening Human Resource (HR) practices and adopting HR technologies such as Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS), that can collect, store and report workforce data are often described as a potential solution to this problem. Indeed, examples from other industries show that HRIS can help to launch or manage, as well as provide ongoing insights concerning the whole career cycle of an employee. However, few of the existing studies that discuss technology or its impacts on the future of work have focused on health organizations, and those that do have not received sufficient attention in health literature. Furthermore, such contributions as there have been have either prioritized a particular type of technology or focused mainly on the effect of automation on health professionals' work. They have thus overlooked the full range of possible uses of these technologies and, specifically, have neglected the topic of HR for Health (HRH) management in health organizations. The primary aim of this paper is to address this lacuna, with specific reference to the existing categorization of HR technological disruptions. To conclude, health organizations and the health and HR professionals who work within them need to use HRIS responsibly, finding a balance between the drive for innovation, productivity and efficiency and respect for all potential legal, ethical and compliance issues, as well as taking account of the importance of HRH wellbeing and satisfaction.

AB BackgroundPeople living in poverty (PLP) are highly vulnerable to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology of HBV infection in PLP in the metropolitan region of Goiania, Goias State, in the Central-West Region of Brazil.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted from August to December 2016 in adults aged 12years living in poverty. The following serological markers for HBV were investigated: hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to HBV core antigen (total anti-HBc), IgM anti-HBc, and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), which were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Poisson regression analysis with robust variance was performed to verify the factors associated with HBV exposure.ResultsThe study included 378 participants. The overall prevalence rate of HBV (any viral marker) was 9.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.2-13.2). The prevalence rate of HBsAg in combination with total anti-HBc was 0.8% (95% CI, 0.3-2.4), total anti-HBc in combination with anti-HBs was 7.7% (95% CI, 5.4-10.9), and total anti-HBc alone was 1.3% (95% CI, 0.5-3.0) in the population. Furthermore, isolated positivity for anti-HBs was identified in only 25.4% (95% CI, 21.3-30.0) of the participants. Multiple regression analysis revealed that age (adjusted prevalence ratio [APR], 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07), female sex (APR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.01-4.73), sexual intercourse under the influence of alcohol (APR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.36-7.06), and exposure to Treponema pallidum (APR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.36-7.06) were associated with HBV exposure.ConclusionThere was a high prevalence of HBV exposure in PLP in the Central-West Region of Brazil, indicating significant viral spread of the infection. Additionally, there was low serological evidence of immunisation against hepatitis B, indicating that a large proportion of the participants in this study are susceptible to the infection. The results support the need for public health policies that facilitate access to the existing healthcare services in hard-to-reach groups with special regard to immunisation programmes against hepatitis B.

AB BackgroundProblem gambling (PG) is a serious public health concern that disproportionately affects people experiencing poverty, homelessness, and multimorbidity including mental health and substance use concerns. Little research has focused on self-help and self-management in gambling recovery, despite evidence that a substantial number of people do not seek formal treatment. This study explored the literature on PG self-management strategies. Self-management was defined as the capacity to manage symptoms, the intervention, health consequences and altered lifestyle that accompanies a chronic health concern.MethodsWe searched 10 databases to identity interdisciplinary articles from the social sciences, allied health professions, nursing and psychology, between 2000 and June 28, 2017. We reviewed records for eligibility and extracted data from relevant articles. Studies were included in the review if they examined PG self-management strategies used by adults (18+) in at least a subset of the sample, and in which PG was confirmed using a validated diagnostic or screening tool.ResultsWe conducted a scoping review of studies from 2000 to 2017, identifying 31 articles that met the criteria for full text review from a search strategy that yielded 2662 potential articles. The majority of studies examined self-exclusion (39%), followed by use of workbooks (35%), and money or time limiting strategies (17%). The remaining 8% focused on cognitive, behavioural and coping strategies, stress management, and mindfulness.ConclusionsGiven that a minority of people with gambling concerns seek treatment, that stigma is an enormous barrier to care, and that PG services are scarce and most do not address multimorbidity, it is important to examine the personal self-management of gambling as an alternative to formalized treatment.

AB BackgroundPrevious studies have shown that unemployment has negative impacts on various aspects of health. However, little is known about the effect of unemployment on health-related quality of life. Our aim was to examine how unemployment impacts upon health-related quality of life among Swedish adults, and to investigate these effects on population subgroups defined by education level, marital status, previous health, and gender.MethodsAs part of a cross-sectional study, a questionnaire was sent to 2500 randomly selected individuals aged 20 to 64years living in Sweden in 2016. The questionnaire included the EuroQol 5 dimensions (EQ-5D) instrument and was answered by 967 individuals (39%). Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) scores were derived from the EQ-5D responses. Of the respondents, 113 were unemployed and 724 were employed. We used inverse probability-weighted propensity scores in our analyses to estimate a risk difference. Gender, age, education level, marital status, and previous health were used as covariates in our analyses.ResultsThere was a statistically significant lower QALY score by 0.096 points for the unemployed compared to the employed. There were also statistically significant more problems due to unemployment for usual activities (6.6% more), anxiety/depression (23.6% more), and EQ-5D's Visual Analogue Scale (7.5 point lower score). Grouped analyses indicated a larger negative health effect from becoming unemployed for men, those who are married, and young individuals.ConclusionsIn our study, we show that the health deterioration from unemployment is likely to be large, as our estimated effect implies an almost 10% worse health (in absolute terms) from being unemployed compared to being employed. This further highlights that unemployment is a public health problem that needs more focus. Our study also raises further demands for determining for whom unemployment has the most negative effects and thus suggesting groups of individuals who are in greatest need for labor market measures.

ID ORAL-CAVITY; UNCOMMON
AB BackgroundTuberculosis (TB) is a serious infectious disease with considerable fatality, typically affecting the pulmonary system and, rarely, other body organs including the oral cavity. Due to the rarity of oral TB, it is frequently overlooked in differential diagnosis of oral lesions. Despite a declining trend in TB incidence in recent years, it is still a major public health problem with high contagiousness, thereby requiring the early diagnosis and prompt treatment.Case presentationA 57-year-old male patient presented with chief complaint of painful ulcer on tip of his tongue. He reported that the ulcer developed without any remarkable event such as mechanical trauma, vesicle formation or systemic illness. His past medical history revealed the TB over 40years ago, which had reportedly healed after pharmacological treatments. As the ulceration persisted after topical steroid application and careful education about avoiding possible mechanical stimuli, biopsy was performed and histological finding showed typical findings of oral tuberculosis including intense granulomatous inflammatory features with small red rods of mycobacterial organisms as well as epithelioid cells and Langhans giant cells. After suitable antituberculosis treatments, oral tuberculosis ulcer was almost completely healed. We present a case of oral TB affecting tip of the tongue in a patient with a history of pulmonary TB and emphasize the understanding of intraoral manifestations for early diagnosis and prompt treatment of TB.ConclusionsThe present case represented the importance of understanding oral tuberculosis manifestations for dental clinicians who might be frequently the first health care professionals to encounter various oral lesions.

ID HEALTH; CONSENSUS
AB BackgroundSarcopenia is the age-related loss of muscle mass and function, which increases fall risks in older persons. Hyperglycemia relating to Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is postulated to aggravate sarcopenia. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of sarcopenia among ambulatory community-dwelling older patients, aged 60-89years, with T2DM in a primary care setting and to identify factors which mitigate sarcopenia.MethodsA total of 387 patients were recruited from a public primary care clinic in Singapore. Data on their socio-demography, clinical and functional status, levels of physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire) and frailty status was collected. The Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) criteria were used to define sarcopenia based on muscle mass, grip strength and gait speed.ResultsThe study population comprised men (53%), Chinese (69%), mean age=68.3SD5.66years, lived in public housing (90%), had hypertension (88%) and dyslipidemia (96%). Their mean muscle mass was 6.3SD1.2kg/m(2); mean gait speed was 1.0 +/- SD0.2m/s and mean grip strength was 25.5 +/- SD8.1kg. Overall, 30% had pre-sarcopenia, 24% with sarcopenia and 4% with severe sarcopenia. Age (OR=1.14; 95%CI=1.09-1.20;p<0.001), multi-morbidity (OR=1.25;95%CI=1.05-1.49;p=0.011) diabetic nephropathy (OR=2.50;95%CI=1.35-5.13;p=0.004), hip circumference (OR=0.86;95%CI=0.82-0.90;p<0.001) and number of clinic visits in past 1 year (OR=0.74; 95%CI=0.59-0.92;p=0.008) were associated with sarcopenia.Conclusions p id=Par4 Using AWGS criteria, 58% of older patients with T2DM had pre-sarcopenia and sarcopenia. Age, diabetic nephropathy, hip circumference, multi-morbidity and fewer clinic visits, but not a recent single HBA1c reading, were significantly associated with sarcopenia among patients with T2DM. A longitudinal relationship between clinic visits and sarcopenia should be further evaluated. p id=Par5 (250 words)

TI HIV sexual risk behavior and preferred HIV prevention service outlet by

SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID HEALTH; VIOLENCE; MSM
AB BackgroundThe study objectives were to identify differences in HIV sexual risk behavior of men who had sex with other men (MSM) resident in urban and rural Nigeria, their perspectives on need for HIV prevention services and perceived barriers and facilitators to access of HIV prevention services in private, public and peer-led health facilities.MethodData were collected from MSM resident in urban and rural parts of River and Kaduna States. Qualitative assessment sought perspectives on barriers and facilitators of MSM uptake of HIV prevention services. In addition, a questionnaire was administered to seek information on HIV sexual risk behaviors (sexual abuse, age of sexual debut, multiple sexual partners and use of condom at last sexual intercourse), willingness to use and perceived barriers to access of HIV prevention services in public, private and peer-led health facilities, and willingness to use and perception about availability of structural intervention services. Differences in HIV sexual risk behaviors by residential location, and associations between sexual risk behavior and willingness to access HIV prevention services were determined.ResultsMore MSM resident in urban than rural areas engaged in three or more HIV sexual risk behaviors (25.9% vs 8.7%; p=0.02). More respondents were willing to access HIV prevention service provided through peer-led health facilities. Less than 35% of respondents identified non-availability of free services as a barrier to HIV prevention service access in the three types of health facilities. More MSM with multiple sexual risk behaviors were willing to access services promoting mental and psychosocial health (p<0.001), HIV positive peer support programs (p=0.002) and training on human rights and paralegal services (p<0.001). Respondents opined that services that assured confidential HIV testing and mitigated structural drivers of HIV infection for MSM provided through peer-led facilities, will increase MSM's uptake of HIV prevention services.ConclusionHIV risk reduction intervention services differentiated by rural and urban residence, may be needed for MSM. Services provided through peer-led facilities, that include mental and psychosocial health care, peer support, human rights and paralegal services will likely increase its use by MSM with more HIV sexual risk behaviors.

AB BackgroundDespite evidence for the harms of waterpipe tobacco smoking (WTS), its use is increasing amongst college and university students worldwide. This systematic review aims to assess the knowledge of, attitudes towards and perceptions of WTS among college or university students.MethodsWe electronically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PSYCHINFO and ISI the Web of Science in October 2018, restricting our search to studies published since January 1990. We included studies among university or college students that used qualitative or quantitative methods, and addressed either knowledge, attitudes, or perceptions towards WTS. We excluded studies where WTS could not be distinguished from other forms of tobacco use and studies reported as abstracts where the full text could not be identified. Data were synthesised qualitatively and analysed data by region (global north/ south), and by reasons for use, knowledge of health hazards, how knowledge influences use, perceptions towards dependence, and policy knowledge.ResultsEighty-six studies were included; 45 from the global north and 41 from the global south. Socio-cultural and peer influences were major contributing factors that encouraged students to initiate WTS. Furthermore, WTS dependence had two components: psychological and social. This was compounded by the general perception that WTS is a less harmful, less addictive and more sociable alternative to cigarette smoking. Knowledge of WTS harms failed to correlate with a reduced risk of WTS use, and some students reported symptoms of WTS addiction. A large proportion of students believed that quitting WTS was easy, yet few were able to do so successfully. Finally, students believed current public health campaigns to educate on WTS harms were inadequate and, particularly in the global north, were not required.ConclusionReasons for WTS amongst university students are multi-faceted. Overall, interventions at both the individual and community level, but also policy measures to portray a message of increased harm amongst students, are required. Additional studies are necessitated to understand temporal changes in students' beliefs, thus allowing for better targeted interventions.

AB BackgroundInappropriate use of antibiotics is a worldwide issue. In order to help public health institutions and each particular physician to change patterns of consumption among patients, it is important to understand better the reasons why people accept to take or refuse to take the antibiotic drugs. This study explored the motives people give for taking or refusing to take antibiotics.MethodsFour hundred eighteen adults filled out a 60-item questionnaire that consisted of assertions referring to reasons for which the person had taken antibiotics in the past and a 70-item questionnaire that listed reasons for which the person had sometimes refused to take antibiotics.ResultsA six-factor structure of motives to take antibiotics was found: Appropriate Prescription, Protective Device, Enjoyment (antibiotics as a quick fix allowing someone to go out), Others' Pressure, Work Imperative, and Personal Autonomy. A four-factor structure of motives not to take antibiotics was found: Secondary Gain (through prolonged illness), Bacterial Resistance, Self-defense (the body is able to defend itself) and Lack of trust. Scores on these factors were related to participants' demographics and previous experience with antibiotics.ConclusionAlthough people are generally willing to follow their physician's prescription of antibiotics, a notable proportion of them report adopting behaviors that are beneficial to micro-organisms and, as a result, potentially detrimental to humans.

AB Circadian disruption is a common environmental and occupational exposure with public health consequences, but not much is known about whether circadian disruption affects in utero development. We investigated whether maternal circadian disruption, using night shift work as a proxy, is associated with variations in DNA methylation patterns of placental tissue in an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of night shift work. Here, we compared cytosine-guanosine dinucleotide (CpG) specific methylation genome-wide of placental tissue (measured with the Illumina 450K array) from participants (n = 237) in the Rhode Island Child Health Study (RICHS) who did (n = 53) and did not (n = 184) report working the night shift, using robust linear modeling and adjusting for maternal age, pre-pregnancy smoking, infant sex, maternal adversity, and putative cell mixture. Statistical analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons and results presented with Bonferroni or Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) adjustment for false discovery rate. Night shift work was associated with differential methylation in placental tissue, including CpG sites in the genes NAV1, SMPD1, TAPBP, CLEC16A, DIP2C, FAM172A, and PLEKHG6 (Bonferroni-adjusted p<0.05). CpG sites within NAV1, MXRA8, GABRG1, PRDM16, WNT5A, and FOXG1 exhibited the most hypomethylation, while CpG sites within TDO2, ADAMTSL3, DLX2, and SERPINA1 exhibited the most hyper-methylation (BH q<0.10). Functional analysis indicated GO-terms associated with cell-cell adhesion and enriched GWAS results for psoriasis. Night shift work was associated with differential methylation of the placenta, which may have implications for fetal health and development. This is the first study to examine the epigenetic impacts of night shift exposure, as a proxy for circadian disruption, on placental methylation in humans, and, while results should be interpreted with caution, suggests circadian disruption may have epigenetic impacts.

   A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2017 among midwives practicing in the public and private sectors in Paris using an online questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of the data was conducted.
   Results
   The response rate was 31% (n = 208/669). Overall, knowledge of influenza vaccine recommendations and of vaccine safety and effectiveness was high except regarding new-born immunity and influenza vaccine characteristics. Only 10% of midwives systematically prescribed the vaccine. Reported influenza vaccine uptake among midwives was 39%.
   Conclusion
   Efforts to improve the knowledge of midwives regarding the safety and effectiveness of vaccinating pregnant women in order to prevent influenza infection in newborns are necessary. Increasing vaccine uptake in both midwives and pregnant women will require adjusting education strategies.

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Inadequate access to medicines affected by un-'controlled prices is a major concern in developing countries, including Pakistan, which lacks comprehensive data on medicine prices. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the prices, availability and affordability of essential medicines in Lahore division, Pakistan. The survey was undertaken from November, 2016 till March, 2017 by including 50 medicines, 14 from the WHO/HAI core list and 36 supplementary medicines from national essential medicine list (NEML) at public (n = 16) and private (n = 16) health facilities. The prices, availability and affordability of selected medicines were measured using a variant of the WHO/HAI standard methodology available on HAI website and WHO/HAI manual. A questionnaire was used for data collection from Lahore division. The prices were compared to International reference prices (IRPs) and the daily wage of a lowest paid unskilled government worker was used to calculate medicine affordability. Data suggested poor availability of originator brands (OB) in public and private sector facilities, i.e., 6.8% and 55.0%, respectively. Similarly, low availability was observed for lowest price generics (LPGs), both in public (35.3%) and private sector (20.3%) facilities-'far below the WHO global action plan targets of 80% availability of essential medicines by 2025. In private sector, 53% OB and 38% LPG medicines were found excessively priced. The cost of standard treatment with OBs was unaffordable, i.e., above a single daily wage (1.4 day's wages) was demanded to purchase the standard treatment for the selected diseases in case of OBs medicines. Whereas, the cost of LPGs medicine required to purchase the standard treatment of the selected diseases was 0.6 day's wage (median), below a single daily wage. In conclusion, access to essential medicines, especially at public sector facilities was affected by low availability, particularly of OBs in comparison to LPGs. Thus, the better availability of LPGs might be a rational basis of transition into a generic system of prescribing that may improve the availability and accessibility of essential medicines in Lahore division. Medicine prices in Lahore division were found higher in comparison to IRPs. Thus, the efforts must be made to formulate patient's pocket friendly drug pricing policy that favors price cuts and improves affordability.

AB BackgroundIn Ethiopia, the incidence of new cases of breast cancer is currently increasing resulting to high rates of morbidity and mortality. Breast cancer is by far the most common cancer accounting for more than one out of three cancer cases in women and one out of every five in the general population. The study was conducted in University of Gondar Hospital cancer center, located in the North-West Ethiopia; to evaluate the clino-pathologic characteristics of breast cancer and care provided for patients.MethodsAll biopsy proven breast cancer patients treated between 2016 and 2017, were identified and information regarding histology, stage, therapeutic procedure and follow up was retrospectively collected from their individual medical records and descriptive analysis was done.ResultsAmong 82 patients treated, 67 (82%) were women and 15 (18%) were men. The median age at the time of diagnosis was 45years (25-82years). Operation was performed for 56 (68%) patients. The predominant histology was ductal carcinoma in 61 patients (74%), followed by breast carcinoma of No Special Type (NST) in 17 (21%). The late presentation of the patients and the advanced stage at the time of presentation was observed in most of the patients. Chemotherapy was administered in 79 (96%) patients. Radiotherapy was not available in the hospital.ConclusionBreast cancer incidence is rising and becoming a major public health problem in Northern Ethiopia. Breast cancer care in northern-Ethiopia is limited in terms of both pathology, imaging and the offered treatment modalities, which need to be improved.

AB BackgroundIntestinal parasitic infections (IPIs) have been major public health problems in low income countries primarily affecting school children. Previous studies in Ethiopia have shown high burden of intestinal parasitic infections in most children. In order to gain a deeper insight into the magnitude of the problem more information is needed from different localities where similar studies have not been conducted. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of IPIs and associated risk factors among school children in Jawi Primary School, Jawi town, north -west Ethiopia.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted from April to June 2017 to assess the prevalence of IPIs and associated risk factors among Jawi Primary School children, Ethiopia. A total of 422 children were selected using age-stratified systematic random sampling technique. Stool samples were examined microscopically using direct wet-mount and formal-ether concentration techniques. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain information regarding the associated risk factors. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 and p value <0.05 was taken as statistically significant.ResultsOf 406 students examined for IPIs, 235 (57.88%) were positive for one or more intestinal parasites. Single, double and triple infections were 41.9, 6.2 and 1.2%, respectively. Overall infection rate was slightly higher in males (51.85%) than in females (45.30%) though the difference was not significant. Higher prevalence rate (about 51-53%) was recorded among 6 to 18years old children. Prevalence of Giardia lamblia was the highest (19.95%), followed by hookworm (13.8%), Schistosoma mansoni (10.3%), Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (5.9%), Hymenolepsis nana (4.2%), Taenia species (3%) and Ascaris lumbricoides (0.73%), in that order. Among the risk factors assessed, age, hand washing habit before meals, open field defecation habit, consistency of wearing shoes, habit of eating raw and unwashed vegetables, and finger nail cleanliness and trimming habit were found to be the most important predictors associated with high risk of IPIs (p<0.05).ConclusionHigh prevalence of IPIs among Jawi Primary school children demands improved health education on regular hand washing, latrine use, wearing shoes, cleaning finger nails, not crossing rivers with bare foot and avoiding eating raw vegetables.

AB BackgroundScholarly Concentrations programs in U.S. medical schools aim to instill passion for critical thinking and promote careers in academic medicine. The rise of these programs has seen variable goals, structure, and outcomes. Transformation of these programs internationally is in its infancy.MethodsWe describe implementation of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Scholarly Concentrations program, offering Basic Science, Clinical Science, Medical Ethics/Healing Arts, History of Medicine, and Public Health/Community Service, at Bezmialem Vakif University in Istanbul, Turkey. Over six modules in the preclinical years, students develop a faculty-mentored experience which encourages the acquisition of attitudes and skills for self-directed, lifelong learning and scholarship. This culminates in abstract and project presentation. We report program characteristics (context and logistics) and outcomes (student engagement and experiences).ResultsThe Scholarly Concentrations program at Bezmialem began in 2014, with nearly two completed cohorts of students. In comparison to Johns Hopkins, students at Bezmialem begin at an earlier age (thus do not have as much prior research experience) and are subsequently evaluated for residency in terms of test scores rather than scholarship and publications, but have a similar level of intellectual curiosity and desire to take ownership of their project. Eighty-two percent of Bezmialem students stated the project they pursued was either their own idea or was an idea they formed after meeting with their mentor. Students at Bezmialem were more likely to choose Clinical Science projects (p=0.009). Only 5% of Bezmialem students in end-of-course survey felt dissatisfied with the level of ownership they experienced with their project, a frequency similar to that seen by Johns Hopkins students (2%).ConclusionsScholarly Concentrations programs play an important role in U.S. medical schools, and these programs can be successfully implemented internationally. The Scholarly Concentrations program at Johns Hopkins has been transformed to a program at Bezmialem in Istanbul, the first program outside North America or the European Union. When designing these programs, one must consider the context, logistics, student engagement, and outcomes. While long-term outcomes are needed, this can serve as a model for implementation elsewhere.

AB BackgroundData-intensive research in medicine and healthcare such as health-related big data research (HBDR) implies that data from clinical routine, research and patient-reported data, but also non-medical social or demographic data, are aggregated and linked in order to optimize biomedical research. In this context, notions of patient participation and involvement are frequently invoked to legitimize this kind of research and improve its governance. The aim of this debate paper is to critically examine the specific use and ethical role of participatory concepts in the context of HBDR and data-intensive research in medicine and healthcare.DiscussionWe introduce basic conceptual distinctions for the understanding of participation by looking at relevant fields of application in politics, bioethics and medical research. Against this backdrop, we identify three paradigmatic participatory roles that patients/subjects are assigned within the field of HBDR: participants as providers of biomaterials and data, participants as administrators of their own research participation and participants as (co-)principal investigators. We further illustrate these roles by exemplary data-intensive research-initiatives. Our analysis of these initiatives and their respective participatory promises reveals specific ethical and practical shortcomings and challenges. Central problems affecting, amongst others, ethical and methodological research standards, as well as public trust in research, result from the negligence of essential political-ethical dimensions of genuine participation.ConclusionsBased on the conceptual distinctions introduced, we formulate basic criteria for justified appeals to participatory approaches in HBDR and data-intensive research in medicine and healthcare in order to overcome these shortcomings. As we suggest, this is not only a matter of conceptual clarity, but a crucial requirement for maintaining ethical standards and trust in HBDR and related medical research.

AB BackgroundThe emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains has posed a severe threat to public health in recent years. The mobile elements carrying the New Delhi metallo--lactqtamase (NDM) gene have been regarded as the major mechanism leading to the rapid increase of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains isolated from clinics and animals.ResultsWe describe an NDM-5-producing Escherichia coli strain, ECCRA-119 (sequence type 156 [ST156]), isolated from a poultry farm in Zhejiang, China. ECCRA-119 is a multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolate that exhibited resistance to 27 antimicrobial compounds, including imipenem and meropenem, as detected by antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST). The complete genome sequence of the ECCRA-119 isolate was also obtained using the PacBio RS II platform. Eleven acquired resistance genes were identified in the chromosome; four were detected in plasmid pTB201, while six were detected in plasmid pTB202. Importantly, the carbapenem-resistant gene bla(NDM-5) was detected in the IncX3 plasmid pTB203. In addition, seven virulence genes and one metal-resistance gene were also detected. The results of conjugation experiments and the transfer regions identification indicated that the bla(NDM-5)-harboring plasmid pTB203 could be transferred between E. coli strains.ConclusionsThe results reflected the severe bacterial resistance in a poultry farm in Zhejiang province and increased our understanding of the presence and transmission of the bla(NDM-5) gene.

AB BackgroundChronic kidney disease (CKD) is a public health problem worldwide, and proteinuria is a well-established marker of disease progression in CKD patients. Propolis, a natural resin produced by bees from plant materials, has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and anti-oxidant properties, as well as having been shown to have an antiproteinuric effect in experimental CKD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of Brazilian green propolis extract on proteinuria reduction and the changes in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).MethodsThis was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study including patients with CKD caused by diabetes or of another etiology, 18-90years of age, with an eGFR of 25-70ml/min per 1.73m(2) and proteinuria (urinary protein excretion >300mg/day) or micro- or macro-albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio>30mg/g or>300mg/g, respectively). We screened 148 patients and selected 32, randomly assigning them to receive 12months of Brazilian green propolis extract at a dose of 500mg/day (n=18) or 12months of a placebo (n=14).ResultsAt the end of treatment, proteinuria was significantly lower in the propolis group than in the placebo group695mg/24h (95% CI, 483 to 999) vs. 1403mg/24h (95% CI, 1031 to 1909); P=0.004independent of variations in eGFR and blood pressure, which did not differ between the groups during follow-up. Urinary monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 was also significantly lower in the propolis group than in the placebo group58pg/mg creatinine (95% CI, 36 to 95) vs. 98pg/mg creatinine (95% CI, 62 to 155); P=0.038.ConclusionsBrazilian green propolis extract was found to be safe and well tolerated, as well as to reduce proteinuria significantly in patients with diabetic and non-diabetic CKD.Trial Registration.(ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT02766036.

ID MISINFORMATION; HEALTH
AB BackgroundInformation and emotions towards public health issues could spread widely through online social networks. Although aggregate metrics on the volume of information diffusion are available, we know little about how information spreads on online social networks. Health information could be transmitted from one to many (i.e. broadcasting) or from a chain of individual to individual (i.e. viral spreading). The aim of this study is to examine the spreading pattern of Ebola information on Twitter and identify influential users regarding Ebola messages.MethodsOur data was purchased from GNIP. We obtained all Ebola-related tweets posted globally from March 23, 2014 to May 31, 2015. We reconstructed Ebola-related retweeting paths based on Twitter content and the follower-followee relationships. Social network analysis was performed to investigate retweeting patterns. In addition to describing the diffusion structures, we classify users in the network into four categories (i.e., influential user, hidden influential user, disseminator, common user) based on following and retweeting patterns.ResultsOn average, 91% of the retweets were directly retweeted from the initial message. Moreover, 47.5% of the retweeting paths of the original tweets had a depth of 1 (i.e., from the seed user to its immediate followers). These observations suggested that the broadcasting was more pervasive than viral spreading. We found that influential users and hidden influential users triggered more retweets than disseminators and common users. Disseminators and common users relied more on the viral model for spreading information beyond their immediate followers via influential and hidden influential users.ConclusionsBroadcasting was the dominant mechanism of information diffusion of a major health event on Twitter. It suggests that public health communicators can work beneficially with influential and hidden influential users to get the message across, because influential and hidden influential users can reach more people that are not following the public health Twitter accounts. Although both influential users and hidden influential users can trigger many retweets, recognizing and using the hidden influential users as the source of information could potentially be a cost-effective communication strategy for public health promotion. However, challenges remain due to uncertain credibility of these hidden influential users.

TI Prevalence, attitudes, behaviours and policy evaluation of midwakh
   smoking among young people in the United Arab Emirates: Cross-sectional
   analysis of the Global Youth Tobacco Survey
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID DOKHA; CIGARETTE; STUDENTS
AB Introduction
   Non-cigarette tobacco products are an increasing public health concern globally. Little is known about midwakh, a pipe indigenous to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This study aimed to assess the prevalence, attitudes, behaviours and policy evaluation of midwakh smoking among 13 to 15 year olds in the UAE.
   Methods
   We conducted secondary analyses of the 2013 UAE Global Youth Tobacco Survey. The main three outcomes were ever use, current use (past-30 days), and the number of midwakhs smoked per day. We assessed cessation, attitude, and policy measures. Regression models identified the association between each outcome measure and sex, school grade, nationality, weekly spending money, cigarette use, and parent and peer tobacco use.
   Results
   The prevalence of ever and current midwakh use were 18.5% and 9.0%, respectively. Daily midwakh users smoked a median of 8.0 per day while non-daily users smoked 3.8 per month. Higher midwakh prevalence was reported among wealthier males, older age groups, concurrent cigarette users and among participants having peers or parents who use tobacco. There was also variation by nationality. Reduced harm perception was greater among midwakh users than non-users. About 39.6% reported being declined a midwakh purchase due to age, and 35.5% reported noticing health warnings on packages.
   Conclusions
   Midwakh use is prevalent among 13 to 15 year olds in the UAE, and burden lies mainly with daily users. Further needed research should not delay implementation and evaluation of policies known to curb tobacco use among youth, including taxation, media campaigns, and provision of cessation services.

   PREVALENCE; DISEASE; GUINEA
AB Rodents serve as reservoirs and/or vectors for several human infections of high morbidity and mortality in the tropics. Population growth and demographic shifts over the years have increased contact with these mammals, thereby increasing opportunities for disease transmission. In Africa, the burden of rodent-borne diseases is not well described. To investigate human seroprevalence of selected rodent-borne pathogens, sera from 657 healthy adults in ten rural communities in Ghana were analyzed. An in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to Lassa virus was positive in 34 (5%) of the human samples. Using commercial kits, antibodies to hantavirus serotypes, Puumala and Dobrava, and Leptospira bacteria were detected in 11%, 12% and 21% of the human samples, respectively. Forty percent of residents in rural farming communities in Ghana have measurable antibodies to at least one of the rodent-borne pathogens tested, including antibodies to viral hemorrhagic fever viruses. The high seroprevalence found in rural Ghana to rodent-borne pathogens associated with both sporadic cases and larger disease outbreaks will help define disease threats and inform public health policy to reduce disease burden in underserved populations and deter larger outbreaks.

TI Socioeconomic inequality and determinants of postnatal home visits made
   by public health midwives: An analysis of the Sri Lanka Demographic and
   Health Survey
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID GOALS; CARE
AB Introduction
   The impact of socioeconomic inequalities on health outcomes and service delivery is increasingly researched globally. This study assessed the overall and sector-wise socioeconomic inequality in postnatal home visits made by Public Health Midwives (PHMs) in Sri Lanka and decomposed the observed socioeconomic inequality into potential determinants.
   Methods
   Data from the Sri Lanka Demographic and Health Survey (SLDHS) 2006-07 were used. Data were collected from ever-married women who gave birth to their last child in 2001 or later (up to 2007). Whether the PHM visited the home to provide postnatal care within one month of the delivery was the health outcome of interest. Sri Lanka is divided into three sectors (areas) as urban, rural, and estate (plantation) based on the geographical location and the availability of infrastructure facilities. Concentration indices were calculated and concentration curves were plotted to quantify the overall and sector-wise socioeconomic inequality. Decomposition analysis using probit regression was performed to estimate the contribution of potential determinants to the observed socioeconomic inequality.
   Results
   Overall, 83.0% of women were visited by a PHM within one month of the delivery. The highest number of home visits was reported in the rural sector (84.5%) and lowest was reported from the estate sector (72.4%). A pro-poor, pro-rich, and no inequality were observed across urban, rural, and estate sectors respectively. Wealth had a small contribution to the estimated inequality. Province of residence and the education level of women were the main determinants of the observed socioeconomic inequality.
   Conclusion
   Addressing the socioeconomic inequality of postnatal home visits made by PHMs should not be seen as a health system issue alone. The associated social determinants of health should be addressed through a multi-sectoral approach encompassing the principles of primary health care.

AB Water and sanitation services are fundamental in preventing the spread of waterborne and hygiene-related diseases. However, in developing countries, such as Haiti, access to clean water continues to pose major challenges despite efforts to improve quality and reduce distance. With Leogane being the epicenter of the earthquake in Haiti in 2010, there were dozens of interventions aimed to improve access to clean water, specifically well construction and use of water treatment strategies. Using the socioecological framework, this study collected qualitative data to supplement a household water insecurity experiences (HWISE) survey in order to fully understand the narratives around water in Leogane (urban) and its neighboring commune Gressier (peri-urban). The inclusion criteria for this study was that the participant must be a resident of either site, at least 18 years or older, and a female. Only females were included in this study so that researchers could better understand how perceived water insecurity impacts reproductive health, specifically gynecological infections. This cross-sectional study yielded 61 total in-depth interviews using a semi-structured open ended questionnaire to allow participants the ability to elaborate. Results suggest that there are common misconceptions about water and reproductive health specifically that engaging in sexual intercourse in saltwater will not result in pregnancy. Relevant narratives among the two communes included water acquisition, use of water, and bathing practices, among several others. Through understanding the local Haitian perspective and practices that surround water insecurity, we can better tailor public health interventions to improve access to water, female hygiene practices, and ultimately lower and prevent disease transmission.

AB BackgroundClinical decisions depend on timely laboratory result reporting. The timeliness is commonly expressed in turnaround time and serves as a quality improvement tool to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the laboratory. According to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) guidelines, each laboratory shall establish turnaround times for each of its examinations that reflect clinical needs, and shall periodically evaluate whether or not it is meeting the established turnaround times. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the TAT of laboratory results done in the reference laboratories of the Amhara Public Health Institute, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia.MethodsA retrospective cross sectional study was carried out from 01 January to 31 September 2018. Each patient sample was considered as a study unit. Nine months data were extracted from the sample tracking log and from the Laboratory Information System (LIS) database. Descriptive and summary statistics were calculated using SPSS version 20.0 statistical software.ResultsA total of 34,233 patients samples were tested during the study period. Monthly average TAT ranged from 38.6 to 51.3days for tuberculosis (TB) culture, 5.3 to 42.4days for exposed infant diagnosis (EID) for HIV, 8.4 to 26days for HIV 1 viral load, and 1.9 to 3.5days for TB genexpert tests. Compared with the standard, 76.5% of the viral load, 68.1% of the EID for HIV and 53.8% of the TB genexpert tests had delayed TAT. Repeated reagent stock out, high workload, activities overlapping, and staff turnover were major reasons for the result delays.ConclusionsThere was a delayed turnaround time of laboratory results in APHI. HIV viral load, EID and TB genexpert results were the most affected tests. Workload reduction plan, proper stock management, specific work assignment and trained staff retention are important approaches to minimize the delayed TAT in the setting.

AB BackgroundAs part of the mobile revolution, smartphone-based applications (apps) have become almost indispensable in today's information society. Consequently, the use of medical apps among healthcare professionals has increased heavily over the past years. As little is known on medical app use in day-to-day clinical practice in Austria, the present study aims at closing this knowledge gap by assessing respective prevalence, readiness, and concerns among Austrian practitioners.MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional online survey among a sample of 151 Austrian doctors (mean age 45.0, SD 12.0, 55.0% females). We developed a German study questionnaire on the basis of the Practitioner Telehealth Readiness Assessment Tool (PRAT) to assess medical app use-related readiness and attitudes, and validated it using principal component analysis.ResultsIn our study, 74% of participants used medical apps on a daily basis, with clarity, ease of use, speed, and support in clinical routine mentioned as most important app features. However, the majority of participants perceived certain barriers to use medical apps. Younger participants used more medical apps, were more likely to use them during work, and yielded higher readiness scores. The most often used medical apps were Diagnosia and Embryotox (both 28.5%).ConclusionsNowadays, medical apps serve as an important source of information for many doctors and are especially popular among younger physicians. The omnipresence of smartphones in the smocks of healthcare workers raised awareness for potential shortcomings regarding disruption of traditional face-to-face doctor-patient interaction among all healthcare stakeholders. This study's finding thus highlight the need for initiating a public discussion on legal and social frameworks to successfully integrate mobile apps into everyday clinical.

AB BackgroundMaternal and child health are internationally considered to be among the best measures for assessing health-care quality. The study was carried out with the following aims: 1) to assess the quality of perinatal care (PC) by measuring the frequencies of the five PC indicators developed by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and comparing results with international standards; 2) to examine whether maternal, pregnancy care and neonatal characteristics could be factors associated with the quality of perinatal care hospital performance, measured through these indicators.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed medical charts of women over the age of 18 who experienced delivery in Gynecology/obstetrics wards between January-December 2016, and those of their newborns hospitalized in the Neonatology or Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of a public non-teaching hospital in Catanzaro (Italy). Indicators were calculated according to the methodology specified in the manual for JCAHO measures. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to test the independent association of maternal, pregnancy care and neonatal characteristics on the adherence to JCAHO PC indicators.ResultsThe records of 1943 women and 1974 newborns were identified and reviewed in order to be included in at least one of the PC indicators. Elective/early-term delivery, was performed in 27.6% of eligible women, far from the recommended goal (0%); cesarean section in nulliparous women with a term, singleton baby in a vertex position exceeded the suggested target of <24% and the adherence to antenatal steroids administration was suboptimal (87%). Results of the exclusive breastfeeding indicator achieved a better performance (81%) and compliance with the PC-04 indicator was satisfactory with only 0.4% healthcare-associated bloodstream infection developed in eligible newborns.ConclusionsThis is the first study performed in Italy that has evaluated the quality of PC by using all the five JCAHO indicators. The application of this feasible set of indicators allowed us to measure several aspects of PC for which there is no standardized monitoring system in Italy. Our findings revealed significant deficiencies in the adherence to recommended processes of PC and suggest that there is still substantial work required to improve care.

AB BackgroundMathematical transmission models are increasingly used to guide public health interventions for infectious diseases, particularly in the context of emerging pathogens; however, the contribution of modeling to the growing issue of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remains unclear. Here, we systematically evaluate publications on population-level transmission models of AMR over a recent period (2006-2016) to gauge the state of research and identify gaps warranting further work.MethodsWe performed a systematic literature search of relevant databases to identify transmission studies of AMR in viral, bacterial, and parasitic disease systems. We analyzed the temporal, geographic, and subject matter trends, described the predominant medical and behavioral interventions studied, and identified central findings relating to key pathogens.ResultsWe identified 273 modeling studies; the majority of which (>70%) focused on 5 infectious diseases (human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza virus, Plasmodium falciparum (malaria), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)). AMR studies of influenza and nosocomial pathogens were mainly set in industrialized nations, while HIV, TB, and malaria studies were heavily skewed towards developing countries. The majority of articles focused on AMR exclusively in humans (89%), either in community (58%) or healthcare (27%) settings. Model systems were largely compartmental (76%) and deterministic (66%). Only 43% of models were calibrated against epidemiological data, and few were validated againstout-of-sample datasets (14%). The interventions considered were primarily the impact of different drug regimens, hygiene and infection control measures, screening, and diagnostics, while few studies addressed de novo resistance, vaccination strategies, economic, or behavioral changes to reduce antibiotic use in humans and animals.ConclusionsThe AMR modeling literature concentrates on disease systems where resistance has been long-established, while few studies pro-actively address recent rise in resistance in new pathogens or explore upstream strategies to reduce overall antibiotic consumption. Notable gaps include research on emerging resistance in Enterobacteriaceae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; AMR transmission at the animal-human interface, particularly in agricultural and veterinary settings; transmission between hospitals and the community; the role of environmental factors in AMR transmission; and the potential of vaccines to combat AMR.

AB BackgroundCervical Cancer is still a major public health challenge in low and middle-income countries. HPV testing has been an innovative approach, which was introduced in Argentina for women aged 30+ through the Jujuy Demonstration Project (JDP) carried out between 2012 and 2014. After a positive HPV-test, cytology is used as triage method. Under this protocol, the group of women with HPV+ and normal cytology are recommended to repeat the test within 12-18months. Studies have shown that this group has increased risk of CIN2+, however, assuring high levels of repeating test among these women is difficult to achieve. We analyze those factors associated with lower re-test attendance among HPV+/ cytology negative women at a programmatic level in low-middle income settings.MethodsWe used data of women aged 30+ HPV-tested in the JDP and followed until 2018 (n=49,565). We performed a set of different adjusted logistic regression models.Primary outcomes were re-test attendance and re-test attendance within recommended timeframe. We assessed as covariates age, health insurance status, year of HPV-testing, Pap testing in the past 3years, HPV-testing modality (clinician-collected (CC) tests/self-collected (SC) tests), and span between HPV-test collection and report of results.ResultsForty nine thousand five hundred sixty five women were HPV-tested and 6742 had a positive HPV-test. Among HPV+ women, a total of 4522 were HPV+/Cytology negative (67.1%). In total, 3172 HPV+/Cytology negative women (70.1%) had a record of a second HPV test as of March 2018. Only 1196 women (26%) completed the second test within the timeframe. Women with no record of a previous Pap (OR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.4-0.53, p<0.001), aged 64+ (OR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.31-0.68, p<0.001) were less likely to be retested; while women with clinician-collected samples had higher odds of being re-tested (OR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.06-1.91, p<0.001).ConclusionsLow re-test rates were found in HPV +/ normal cytology women. Tailored interventions are needed to increase the effectiveness of the screening in this group, especially for those women with characteristics associated to lower attendance.

AB BackgroundCurrently, urban green infrastructure is increasingly gaining attention as a source of multiple benefits. Understanding how city residents perceive the benefits of green infrastructure is critical for urban policy and planning. This paper investigates public assessment of the benefits of green infrastructure and the associated influencing factors in Bahir Dar and Hawassa cities of Ethiopia.ResultData were collected from residents of the two cities and inferential and descriptive statistics were used to identify public assessment of benefits of green infrastructure and the factors that influence their assessment of benefits of green infrastructure. Findings revealed that people either agree or strongly agree to the triple benefits (environmental, economic and socio-cultural) of green infrastructure. The Pearson's Chi-square test results depict that, except a few, most of the demographic, socio-economic and bio-physical factors have no significant influence on environmental, economic and socio-cultural benefits of green infrastructure.ConclusionThis study implies that an understanding of the public assessment of the benefits of green infrastructure can provide important inputs to promote participatory green infrastructure planning.

AB BackgroundIn most countries, patients can get a second opinion (SO) through public or private healthcare systems. There is lack of data on SO utilization in private vs. public settings. We aim to evaluate the characteristics of people seeking SOs in private vs. public settings, to evaluate their reasons for seeking a SO from a private physician and to compare the perceived outcomes of SOs given in a private system vs. a public system.MethodsA cross-sectional national telephone survey, using representative sample of the general Israeli population (n=848, response rate=62%). SO utilization was defined as seeking an additional clinical opinion from a specialist within the same specialty, on the same medical concern. We modeled SO utilization in a public system vs. a private system by patient characteristics using a multivariate logistic regression model.Results214 of 339 respondents who obtained a SO during the study period, did so in a private practice (63.1%). The main reason for seeking a SO from a private physician rather than a physician in the public system was the assumption that private physicians are more professional (45.7%). However, respondents who obtained a private SO were neither more satisfied from the SO (p=0.45), nor felt improvement in their perceived clinical outcomes after the SO (p=0.37). Low self-reported income group, immigrants (immigrated to Israel after 1989) and religious people tended to seek SOs from the public system more than others.ConclusionsThe main reason for seeking a SO from private physicians was the assumption that they are more professional. However, there were no differences in satisfaction from the SO nor perceived clinical improvement. As most of SOs are sought in the private system, patient misconceptions about the private market superiority may lead to ineffective resource usage and increase inequalities in access to SOs. Ways to improve public services should be considered to reduce health inequalities.

DE Paternal age; Maternal age; Down syndrome; Chromosomal disorders;

ID OLDER REPRODUCTIVE AGE; ESTIMATED AUTISM RISK; FATHERS
AB BackgroundMultiple neonatal and pediatric disorders have been linked to older paternal ages. Combining these findings with the evidence that many men are having children at much later ages generates considerable public health concern. The risk of paternal age has been difficult to estimate and interpret because children often have parents whose ages are similar and likely to be confounded. Epidemiologic studies often model the conditional effects of paternal age using regression models that typically treat maternal age as linear, curvilinear or as age-band categories. Each of these approaches has limitations. As an alternative, the current study measures age to the nearest year, and fits a Bayesian model in which each parent's age is given a conditional autoregressive prior (CAR).MethodsData containing approximately 12,000,000 birth records were obtained from the United States Natality database for the years 2014 to 2016. Date were cross-tabulated for maternal ages 15-49years and for paternal ages 15-65years. A Bayesian logistic model was implemented using conditional autoregressive priors for both maternal and paternal ages modeled separately and jointly for both Down syndrome and chromosomal disorders other than Down syndrome.ResultsModels with maternal and paternal ages given CAR priors were judged to be better fitting than traditional models. For Down syndrome, the approach attributed a very large risk to advancing maternal age with the effect of advancing paternal age having a very small sparing effect on birth prevalence. Maternal age was also related to the birth prevalence of chromosomal disorders other than Down syndrome while paternal age was not.ConclusionsAdvancing paternal age was not associated with an increase in risk for either Down syndrome or chromosomal disorders other than Down syndrome.

AB BackgroundUndernutrition is an important public health indicator for monitoring nutritional status and survival. In spite of its importance, undernutrition is a significant problem health problem in many East African communities. The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with childhood undernutrition in three disadvantaged East African Districts.MethodsWe examined data for 9270 children aged 0-59months using cross-sectional survey from Gicumbi District in Rwanda, Kitgum District in Uganda and Kilindi District in Tanzania. We considered the level of undernutrition (stunting, wasting and underweight) as the outcome variables with four ordinal categories (severely undernourished, moderately undernourished, mildly undernourished, and nourished). Generalized linear latent and mixed models (GLLAMM) with the mlogit link and binomial family that adjusted for clustering and sampling weights were used to identify factors associated with undernutrition among children aged 0-59months in three disadvantaged East African Districts.ResultsAfter adjusting for potential confounding factors, the odds of a child being stunted were higher in Gicumbi District in Rwanda while the odds of a child being wasted and underweight were higher in Kitgum District in Uganda. Having diarrhoea two weeks prior to the survey was significantly associated with severe undernutrition. Wealth index (least poor household), increasing child's age, sex of the child (male) and unavailability of water all year were reported to be associated with moderate or severe stunting/wasting. Children of women who did not attend monthly child growth monitoring sessions and children who had Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) symptoms were significantly associated with moderate or severe underweight.ConclusionsFindings from our study indicated that having diarrhoea, having ARI, not having water availability all year and not attending monthly child growth monitoring sessions were associated with undernutrition among children aged 0-59months. Interventions aimed at improving undernutrition in these disadvantaged communities should target all children especially those children from households with poor sanitation practices.

AB BackgroundObesity and caries in young people are issues of public health concern. Even though research into the relationship between the two conditions has been conducted for many years, to date the results remain equivocal. The aim of this paper was to determine the nature of the relationship between Body Mass Index (BMI) and caries in children and adolescents, by conducting a systematic review of the published literature.MethodsA systematic search of studies examining the association between BMI and caries in individuals younger than 18years old was conducted. The electronic bibliographic databases PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL and Google Scholar were searched. References of included studies were checked to identify further potential studies. Internal and external validity as well as reporting quality were assessed using the validated Methodological Evaluation of Observational Research checklist. Results were stratified based on the risk of flaws in 14 domains 10 of which were considered major and four minor.ResultsOf the 4208 initially identified studies, 84 papers met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review; conclusions were mainly drawn from 7 studies at lower risk of flaws. Three main types of association between BMI and caries were found: 26 studies showed a positive relationship, 19 showed a negative association, and 43 found no association between the variables of interest. Some studies showed more than one pattern of association. Assessment of confounders was the domain most commonly found to be flawed, followed by sampling and research specific bias. Among the seven studies which were found to be at lower risk of being flawed, five found no association between BMI and caries and two showed a positive association between these two variables.ConclusionsEvidence of an association between BMI and caries was inconsistent. Based on the studies with a low risk lower risk of being flawed, a positive association between the variables of interest was found mainly in older children. In younger children, the evidence was equivocal. Longitudinal studies examining the association between different indicators of obesity and caries over the life course will help shed light in their complex relationship.

AB A decade long study was conducted to investigate the ecological, biological, and temporal conditions that affect concentrations of Vibrio spp. bacteria in a well-studied lagoonal estuary. Water samples collected from the Neuse River Estuary in eastern North Carolina from 2004-2014 (with additional follow-up samples from Fall of 2018) were analyzed to determine Vibrio spp. concentrations, as well as the concentrations of inorganic and organic nutrients, fecal indicator bacteria, phytoplankton biomass, and a wide range of other physiochemical estuarine parameters. A significant increase in Vibrio spp. was observed to occur in the estuary over the examined period. Strikingly, over this long duration study period, this statistically significant increase in total culturable Vibrio spp. concentrations does not appear to be correlated with changes in salinity, temperature, or dissolved oxygen, the three most commonly cited influential factors that predict estuarine Vibrio spp. abundance. Furthermore, shorter term (similar to 3 years) data on specific Vibrio species (V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus) show that while Vibrio spp. are increasing overall as a genus, the numbers of some key potentially pathogenic species are decreasing as a part of the total population, further supporting the concept that quantification of the entire genus is not a worthwhile use of resources toward predicting levels of specific potentially pathogenic species of public health concern. The significant increase in this concentration of Vibrio spp. in the studied estuary appears to be related to nitrogen and carbon in the system, indicating a continued need for further research.

TI Enhanced sentinel surveillance for hepatitis B infection in 200 counties
   in China, 2013-2016
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Hepatitis B infection is a major public health challenge in China. Clinicians report hepatitis B cases to the National Notifiable Disease Reporting System. A 2007 study found that only 35% of hepatitis B cases that had been reported as acute infections met a rigorous case definition of acute hepatitis B, implying overreporting of new-onset infections. To increase the accuracy of reported acute hepatitis B infections, in 2013, we initiated enhanced hepatitis B surveillance in 200 sentinel counties. We compared incidences and proportions of different stages of hepatitis B infection before and after implementation of enhanced surveillance. We checked the accuracy of reported data and re-diagnosed hepatitis B cases reported as acute infection according to the enhanced diagnostic criteria and calculated positive predictive value(PPV) of acute hepatitis B reports. Compared to previous surveillance, with enhanced surveillance, the incidence of reported acute hepatitis B infection decreased by 53.7% and the proportion of unclassified hepatitis B infection was reduced by 79.4%. From 2013 to 2016, the PPV of acute hepatitis B increased (55.8% to 71.0%); PPV rates in western and rural areas were lower than in other areas. We recommend enhancing hepatitis B surveillance nationwide using these new standards, and raising western and rural areas clinicians' diagnostic and reporting capacity, and ensuring sufficient resources for IgM anti-HBc testing.

TI Undernutrition and its associated factors among pregnant mothers in
   Gondar town, Northwest Ethiopia
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   Regardless of significant gains and signs of progress in the last decades, maternal undernutrition remains a major public health concern in Ethiopia. Supporting the progress of interventions being taken in the country with evidence might be important to keep the sustainability of the government effort. We aimed at determining the extent of undernutrition and its associated factors among pregnant mothers in Gondar town, Northwest Ethiopia.
   Method
   A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted by including 940 selected pregnant mothers through a cluster sampling. A face-to-face interview was administered to pregnant mothers at a household level. We collected data using an Online Data collection kit (ODK) and the collected data was directly downloaded from the Google Cloud platform and finally imported to Stata 14 for further analysis. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to identify factors associated with undernutrition. A crude and adjusted odds ratio with their 95% confidence interval was calculated to declare the association and its significance. Model fitness was assured through the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit test and model classification accuracy.
   Result
   14.4% (95% CI: 12.3-16.7) of pregnant mothers were undernourished. After adjusting for the main covariates; as the age of the pregnant mothers increases the odds of being undernourished decreases by 10% (AOR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.87-0.95) and having a poor marital condition (AOR: 2.18; 95% CI: 1.03-4.59) increased the odds of undernutrition. The risk of undernutrition was also decreased by 43% among those pregnant mothers who consumed coffee sometimes (AOR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.36-0.89) as compared to daily consumers.
   Conclusion
   A significant proportion of pregnant mother were undernourished. Integration of nutritional interventions with maternity health services would be highly important to improve the nutritional status of the mothers. It is also important to counsel pregnant mothers about a consequence of frequent coffee drinking during their pregnancy.

AB Typhoid fever affects 21 million people globally, 1% of whom succumb to the disease. The social, economic and public health consequences of this disease disproportionately affect people in Africa and Asia. In order to design context specific prevention strategies, we need to holistically characterise outbreaks in these settings. In this study, we used retrospective data (2013-2016) at national and district level to characterise temporal and spatial dynamics of Typhoid fever outbreaks using time series and spatial analysis. We then selected cases matched with controls to investigate household socio-economic drivers using a conditional logistic regression model, and also developed a Typhoid fever outbreak-forecasting framework. The incidence rate of Typhoid fever at national and district level was similar to 160 and 60 cases per 100,000 persons per year, respectively, predominantly in urban areas. In Kasese district, Bwera sub-county registered the highest incidence rate, followed by Kisinga, Kitholhu and Nyakiyumbu sub-counties. The male-female case ratio at district level was at 1.68 and outbreaks occurred between the 20th and 40th week (May and October) each year following by seven weeks of precipitation. Our forecasting framework predicted outbreaks better at the district level rather than national. We identified a temporal window associated with Typhoid fever outbreaks in Kasese district, which is preceded by precipitation, flooding and displacement of people. We also observed that areas with high incidence of Typhoid fever also had high environmental contamination with limited water treatment. Taken together with the forecasting framework, this knowledge can inform the development of specific control and preparedness strategies at district and national level.

TI Dust or disease? Perceptions of influenza in rural Southern Malawi

ID AVIAN INFLUENZA; ILLNESS; AFRICA; VACCINATION; COUNTRIES; CHILDREN; FLU
AB Influenza virus infections cause between 291 243 and 645 832 deaths annually, with the highest burden in low-income settings. Research in high-income countries has examined public understanding of influenza, but there is little information on views and behaviours about influenza in low-income countries. We explored communities' ideas about the severity, causes, prevention and treatment of influenza in Chikwawa district, Malawi. We conducted 64 in-depth interviews with parents of children aged <5 years, and 7 focus groups with community health workers, parents, and traditional healers. Data were analysed thematically and using a framework matrix to compare views between groups. Respondents held varied ideas about influenza, and many were uncertain about its causes and treatment. Some parents, traditional healers and health workers thought influenza was not severe because they felt it did not cause death or limit activities, but others disagreed. Many saw influenza as a symptom of other conditions, especially malaria and pneumonia, rather than as a disease of its own. Most mentioned dust as the main cause of influenza and believed influenza could be prevented by cleaning the home thoroughly. Treatment seeking for influenza followed different stages, usually starting with home remedies followed by purchasing drugs from groceries and then visiting a health centre. Seeking a clinician tended to be triggered by severe symptoms like high fever or difficulty breathing, and suspicions of malaria or pneumonia. Community health workers provide health education for communities, but some lacked understanding of influenza. Our findings suggest uncertainty about the causes and control of influenza among parents and varied levels of understanding among health providers. Strengthening the capacity of community health workers to provide relevant information about influenza prevention and treatment could address parents' interest in further information and support informed health seeking and engagement with future influenza interventions.

TI Factors associated with suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts among
   adolescent students in Nepal: Findings from Global School-based Students
   Health Survey
SO PLOS ONE

AB Introduction
   Suicide has been recognized as a major public health problem with high burden in low and middle income countries. Suicide has long lasting psychological trauma on friends and relatives in addition to loss of economic productivity. Although the need of high quality evidence is essential for designing suicide prevention program, Nepal lacks reliable evidence from nationally representative data. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempt among adolescent students and identify the factors associated with them.
   Materials and methods
   Total of 6,531 students of grade 7 to 11 from 74 schools representing all three ecological belts and five development regions participated in this cross sectional study. To select the representative sample from study population, two stage cluster sampling method was used. Standardized self-administered questionnaire were completed by participants. Multivariable logistic regression was done to identify the factors associated with suicidal ideation and attempt.
   Results
   Nearly 13.59% of the participants had considered suicide while 10.33% had attempted it. Food insecurity (OR = 2.32, CI = 1.62-3.32), anxiety (OR = 2.54, CI = 1.49-4.30), loneliness (OR = 2.51, CI = 1.44-4.36) and gender (OR = 1.39, CI = 1.03-1.89) were identified as risk factors of suicidal ideation. Anxiety (OR = 3.02, CI = 1.18-7.74), loneliness (OR = 2.19, CI = 1.28-3.73) truancy (OR = 1.99, CI = 1.40-2.82), cigarette use (OR = 3.13, CI = 1.36-7.23) and gender (OR = 1.60, CI = 1.07-2.39) were identified as risk factors of suicidal attempt. Having 3 or more close friends was found to have protective effect (OR = 0.35, CI = 0.16-0.75) against suicidal attempt.
   Conclusion
   Study reveals relatively high prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicidal attempt among school-going adolescents in Nepal. Appropriate coping strategies for factors like anxiety, loneliness seem could be useful for preventing both suicidal ideation and attempt.

TI The macroeconomic burden of noncommunicable diseases associated with air
   pollution in China
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PARTICULATE POLLUTION; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; PUBLIC-HEALTH; MORTALITY;
   RETIREMENT; IMPACT; WORK; CARE
AB Background
   While a few studies have tried to estimate the economic burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) associated with air pollution, most previous studies have methodological limitations. For example, neither the cost of illness approach nor the value of a statistical life approach accounts for economic adjustment mechanisms (i.e., they do not include substitution of labor lost due to an illness with capital or other workers), and neither approach considers disease impact on physical and human capital. Furthermore, since new evidence shows that air pollution is also linked to diabetes, previous studies did not estimate the economic costs of diabetes associated with air pollution. The total economic costs of NCDs associated with air pollution under a comprehensive framework therefore remained unexplored.
   Objectives
   This study uses a human capital-augmented production function framework to analyze and estimate the macroeconomic impact of NCDs associated with air pollution in China in 19902030 and in 2015-2030. It makes several contributions-beyond those of the extant literature-to understanding the economic burden of NCDs associated with air pollution. It does this by accounting for economic adjustment mechanisms and by incorporating human capital into the model.
   Methods
   In our framework, aggregate output is produced according to a human capital-augmented production function that accounts for the effects of projected disease prevalence. NCDs associated with air pollution affect the aggregate output through three pathways: 1) Mortality effect-when working-age individuals die from a disease, aggregate output decreases because physical capital is an imperfect substitute for the loss of human capital in the production process. 2) Morbidity effect-when working-age individuals suffer from a disease but do not die from it, their contribution to overall output also decreases depending on disease severity; for example, they might work fewer hours or with lower productivity, or they might retire earlier. We also incorporate age-specific human capital to account for education-related productivity differences between members of different cohorts who are differentially affected by NCDs. 3) Treatment cost effect-when households in which members suffer from a disease use part of their savings to cover the out-of-pocket share of their treatment costs, physical capital accumulation diminishes. Our estimates are based on the recently updated Global Burden of Disease epidemiology data, which identify four pathways through which air pollution affects health: cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, cancer, and diabetes.
   Results
   Total losses from NCDs associated with air pollution in China in 1990-2030 are estimated to be $ 1,137 billion (constant 2010 USD) and in 2015-2030 are estimated to be $ 499 billion (constant 2010 USD). Cardiovascular diseases account for the highest burden, followed by chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, and cancer. Treatment costs account for nearly 30% of the total economic burden of NCDs associated with air pollution. We also find that the share of economic burden associated with treatment costs is highest for diabetes. This is mainly driven by the fact that, on a per case basis, diabetes has a lower health burden than other diseases associated with air pollution.
   Discussion
   The NCDs associated with air pollution impose a large economic burden on China.

TI Factors associated with recovery from stunting among under-five children

AB Childhood stunting is a public health concern in many low-and-middle income countries, as it is associated with both short-term and long-term negative effects on child cognitive development, physical health, and schooling outcomes. There is paucity of studies on recovery from stunting among under five children in these countries. Most studies focused on the recovery much later in adolescence. We used longitudinal data from two Nairobi urban settlements to determine the incidence of recovery from stunting and understand the factors associated with post-stunting linear growth among under-five children. A total of 1,816 children were recruited between birth and 23 months and were followed-up until they reached five years. We first looked at the time to recover from stunting using event history analysis and Cox regression. Second, we used height-for-age z-score slope modelling to estimate the change in linear growth among children who were stunted. Finally, we fitted a linear regression model of the variation in HAZ on a second degree fractional polynomials in child's age to identify the factors associated with post-stunting linear growth. The principal findings are: i) the incidence of recovery from stunting was 45% among stunted under-five children in the two settlements; ii) timely child immunization, age at stunting, mother's parity and household socioeconomic status are important factors associated with time to recover from stunting within the first five years of life; and iii) child illness status and age at first stunting, mother's parity and age have a strong influence on child post-stunting linear growth. Access to child health services and increased awareness among health professionals and child caregivers, would be critical in improving child growth outcomes in the study settings. Additionally, specific maternal and reproductive health interventions targeting young mothers in the slums may be needed to reduce adolescent and young mother's vulnerability and improve their child health outcomes.

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID DETERMINANTS
AB Background
   The ultimate goal of asthma treatment is long-term control. Uncontrolled asthma is a major public health problem worldwide, but there is a lack of data on asthma control and its causes in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
   Objective
   To determine the socio-demographic, environmental, clinical, and biological factors and comorbidities associated with uncontrolled adult asthma in Kinshasa, DRC.
   Methods
   We performed a cross-sectional study of 216 male and female asthmatics aged 18 and over consecutively recruited from tertiary clinics and the community in Kinshasa between June 2017 and February 2018. For each subject, socio-demographic, clinical, para clinical and environmental data were recorded. Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) values were obtained by Spirometry, allergen testing performed using the skin prick test, serum vitamin D levels measured by radioimmunoassay, and asthma control assessed using the asthma control test (ACT) score. Multiple logistic regression identified factors associated with uncontrolled asthma.
   Results
   The average age of participants was 45.2 (SD 17.6) years, 74% were female, and 42% had a low educational level. Among all asthmatics, the prevalence of uncontrolled asthma was 56%, abnormal serum vitamin D level 95%, abnormal FEV1 65%, sensitization to two allergens (cat dander and dust mites) 18%, sleep disorders 37%, and heartburn 60%. Male (aOR 2.24; 95% CIs 1.04-4.79), low educational level (aOR 3.26; 95% CIs 1.54-6.67), sensitization to both cat dander and dust mites (aOR 2.67; 95% CIs 1.16-6.14), FEV1. 80% (aOR 2.07; 95% CIs 1.08-3.96), abnormal serum vitamin D level (aOR 5.11; 95% CIs 1.17-22.33), sleep disorders (aOR 1.96; 95% CIs 1.04-3.71), and heartburn (aOR 2.02; 95% CIs 1.04-3.92) were significantly associated with uncontrolled asthma.
   Conclusion
   Uncontrolled asthma is common in Kinshasa, and these factors associated with uncontrolled asthma may be considered as targets for future intervention strategies.

TI Legacy health effects among never smokers exposed to occupational
   secondhand smoke
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS; PASSIVE SMOKING; DISEASE; CANCER; RISK
AB Objectives
   Secondhand tobacco smoke (SHTS) is a tremendous public health hazard, leading to morbidity and premature mortality worldwide, with racial and ethnic minorities and those of lower socioeconomic status disproportionately affected. Flight attendants were historically exposed to high levels of SHTS in the aircraft cabin. The health effects of active smoking are known to persist for up to a lifetime, but the legacy effects of SHTS exposure have not been well characterized.
   Design
   We aimed to evaluate the legacy health effects of occupational SHTS exposure among never smoking workers using the resources of the Harvard Flight Attendant Health Study, a large study of cabin crew health. We evaluated associations between SHTS exposure and a range of diagnoses using multivariate logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), employing a case-control sampling method and applying the bootstrap method to increase accuracy and precision of results.
   Results
   We found no evidence of positive associations between SHTS and any cancer, but observed associations between SHTS and cardiac outcomes, including myocardial infarction (OR = 140, 95% CI: 1.04, 3.27) and peripheral artery disease (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.97). We also found associations between SHTS exposure and repeated pneumonia (OR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.10).
   Conclusions
   Our study reports associations between legacy SHTS exposure going back decades and severe cardiac and respiratory health outcomes. Given the high prevalence of ongoing and historical SHTS exposure, our findings, if confirmed, have important implications for smoking cessation efforts, health education, and clinical guidelines.

TI Night work during pregnancy and preterm birth-A large register-based
   cohort study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SHIFT WORK; MELATONIN; PROGESTERONE; RHYTHMS; WEIGHT; HEALTH; RISK
AB Background
   Melatonin stimulates the production of progesterone, which is essential for the maintenance of pregnancy. Since melatonin in blood is reduced due to work under illuminated conditions during night work, it has been hypothesized that night work may increase the risk of preterm birth. Previous meta-analyses have not revealed increased risk of preterm birth in women working night shifts during pregnancy. Still, these studies might have been limited by inaccurate self-reports of timing, intensity and duration of night work most likely causing bias towards the null. The aim of this is study was to investigate if the frequency and duration of night work during the first (week 1-12) and second (week 13-22) trimester of pregnancy were associated with risk of preterm birth when objective and prospective data on night work are used.
   Method
   In a register-based prospective cohort study, we obtained individual day-to-day information on working hours from The Danish Working Hour Database (DWHD, a payroll database including all public service employees in administrative Danish Regions from 2007-2013) and information on preterm birth from the Danish Medical Birth Registry. Night-shift was defined as at least three working hours between 23: 00 and 06: 00. Preterm birth was defined as giving birth during gestational weeks 23-37. Odds of preterm birth according to working night shifts were analysed by logistic regression.
   Results
   We identified 16,501 pregnant women eligible for the study, of which 10,202 women (61.8%) had at least one night-shift during the first 22 gestational weeks. The risk of preterm birth was not elevated among women working night shifts compared to women working only day shifts during either the first or second trimester. Within night-shift workers, the risk was not related to the number of night shifts, the duration of night shifts, consecutive night shifts or quick returns defined as short intervals between shifts. Odds of preterm birth was not related to change of working schedule from the first to second trimester, although women changing from night shifts in the first trimester to day work only in the second trimester displayed a weak increased odds of preterm birth (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.98-1.49) compared to women working night shifts in both trimesters.
   Conclusion
   Our results, which are without bias from self-report of either exposure or outcome, are in line with the results of previous meta-analyses. Due to the detailed information on hours worked during pregnancy, we were able to investigate several dimensions of night work not previously investigated, of which none were associated with elevated risk of preterm birth.

AB BackgroundHospital-treated deliberate self-harm (DSH) is common, costly and has high repetition rates. Since brief contact interventions (BCIs) may reduce the risk of DSH repetition, we aim to evaluate whether a SMS (Short Message Service) text message Intervention plus Treatment As Usual (TAU) compared to TAU alone will reduce hospital DSH re-presentation rates in Western Sydney public hospitals in Australia.Methods/designOur study is a 24-month randomized controlled trial (RCT). Adult patients who present with DSH to hospital emergency, psychiatric, and mental health triage and assessment departments will be randomly assigned to an Intervention condition plus TAU receiving nine SMS text messages at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12-months post-discharge. Each message will contain telephone numbers for two mental health crises support tele-services. Primary outcomes will be the difference in the number of DSH re-presentations, and the time to first re-presentation, within 12-months of discharge.DiscussionThis study protocol describes the design and implementation of an RCT using SMS text messages, which aim to reduce hospital re-presentation rates for DSH. Positive study findings would support the translation of an SMS-aftercare protocol into mental health services at minimal expense.Trial registration and ethics approvalThis trial has been registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (Trial registration: ACTRN12617000607370. Registered 28 April 2017) and has been approved by two Local Health Districts (LHDs). Western Sydney LHD Human Research Ethics Committee approved the study for Westmead Hospital and Blacktown Hospital (Protocol: HREC/16/WMEAD/336). Nepean Blue Mountains LHD Research Governance Office approved the study for Nepean Hospital (SSA/16/Nepean/170).

TI Categorizing and assessing comprehensive drivers of provider behavior
   for optimizing quality of health care
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID NURSE; STRESS; MORTALITY; PROGRAM
AB Inadequate quality of care in healthcare facilities is one of the primary causes of patient mortality in low-and middle-income countries, and understanding the behavior of healthcare providers is key to addressing it. Much of the existing research concentrates on improving resource-focused issues, such as staffing or training, but these interventions do not fully close the gaps in quality of care. By contrast, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the full contextual and internal drivers-such as social norms, beliefs, and emotions-that influence the clinical behaviors of healthcare providers. We aimed to provide two conceptual frameworks to identify such drivers, and investigate them in a facility setting where inadequate quality of care is pronounced. Using immersion interviews and a novel decision-making game incorporating concepts from behavioral science, we systematically and qualitatively identified an extensive set of contextual and internal behavioral drivers in staff nurses working in reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health (RMNCH) in government public health facilities in Uttar Pradesh, India. We found that the nurses operate in an environment of stress, blame, and lack of control, which appears to influence their perception of their role as often significantly different from the RMNCH program's perspective. That context influences their perceptions of risk for themselves and for their patients, as well as self-efficacy beliefs, which could lead to avoidance of responsibility, or incorrect care. A limitation of the study is its use of only qualitative methods, which provide depth, rather than prevalence estimates of findings. This exploratory study identified previously under-researched contextual and internal drivers influencing the care-related behavior of staff nurses in public facilities in Uttar Pradesh. We recommend four types of interventions to close the gap between actual and target behaviors: structural improvements, systemic changes, community-level shifts, and interventions within healthcare facilities.

ID RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; FACE-TO-FACE; ALCOHOL INTERVENTIONS;
   TREATMENT-SEEKING; EFFICACY; PREVALENCE; DISORDERS; VALIDITY; CARE
AB Background
   Brief interventions have been increasingly investigated to promote early intervention in gambling problems; an accurate estimate of the impact of these interventions is required to justify their widespread implementation. The goal of the current investigation was to evaluate the efficacy of in-person brief interventions for reducing gambling behaviour and/or problems, by quantifying the aggregate effect size associated with these interventions in the published literature to date.
   Methods
   Randomized controlled trials including the following design features were identified via systematic review: an adult sample experiencing problems associated with gambling; an in-person individual psychosocial intervention of brief duration (<= 3 sessions); a control/comparison group; and an outcome related to gambling behaviour and/or problems.
   Results
   Five records compared brief interventions to assessment only control; using a random effect model, brief interventions were associated with a small but statistically significant reduction in gambling behaviour across short-term follow-up periods versus assessment only control (g = -.19, 95% CI [-.37, -.01]). Aggregate effect sizes for gambling problems and long-term follow-up periods were not statistically significant. Five records compared brief interventions to longer active interventions; there was no significant difference between brief interventions and longer active interventions.
   Conclusions
   Results supported the efficacy of brief interventions for problem gambling compared to inactive control in the reduction of gambling behaviour; no differences were found across brief versus longer interventions for both gambling behaviour and problems. While these findings must be interpreted in the context of the limited number of studies and small magnitude of the combined effect sizes, the current meta-analysis supports the further investigation of the public health impact of these cost-effective interventions.

AB BackgroundMost Finnish adolescents are not sufficiently physically active. Health education (HE) provides beneficial starting point for physical activity (PA) promotion in schools. This study evaluates an intervention integrated into three HE lessons to increase PA and reduce sedentary behavior (SB) among eighth graders.MethodsAll public secondary schools in Tampere, Finland participated and were randomized to intervention (INT, n=7) and comparison group (COM, n=7). In INT (690 students, 36 classes) the teachers (n=14) implemented behavioral theory-driven content during three HE lessons. In COM (860 students, 41 classes) the teachers (n=14) carried out standard lessons. The evaluation was based on RE-AIM: Effectiveness was assessed from baseline to 4weeks (Follow-up 1) and Maintenance from 4weeks to 7months (Follow-up 2) with change in students' PA and SB and related psychosocial and parental factors. Methods included questionnaire, accelerometer and activity diary. Linear mixed models with baseline adjustments and random effect correction were used to compare the difference in change between INT and COM. Data on Reach, Adoption and Implementation were collected during the process.ResultsIntervention effects were only seen in the self-reported data favoring INT in the weekly number of days with at least 1h of brisk leisure PA (0.3 [95%CI 0.1 to 0.6]), proportion of students meeting PA recommendations (4.1 [95%CI 2.5 to 5.7]), proportion of students reporting that their family sets limitations for screen time (5.4 [95%CI 3.3 to 7.4]) and in the number of days on which the students intended to do leisure PA in the following week (0.3 [95%CI 0.1 to 0.6]). The effects on PA were still beneficial for INT at Follow-up 2. The intervention reached 96% of the students, was adopted in all 7 schools and was implemented by 13/14 teachers in 35/36 classes.ConclusionsThe intervention was feasible and had small favorable effects on students' self-reported PA, intention to do PA and family norm in screen time. The effects on PA persisted until Follow-up 2. It is likely that for greater impacts the HE lessons should have been supported with other actions without compromising feasibility.

ID PREVALENCE
AB Background: India accounts for more than two-third of mortality due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in south-east Asia. The burden is high in Karnataka, one of the largest states in southern India. There is a need for integration of disease prevention, health promotion, treatment and care within the national program at primary level. A public-private partnership initiative explored evidence gaps to inform a health system based, integrated NCD programme across care continuum with a focus on hypertension and diabetes.
   Methods: The study was conducted during 2017-18 in urban parts of Mysore city, covering a population of 58,000. Mixed methods were used in the study; a population-based screening to estimate denominators for those with disease and at risk; cross-sectional surveys to understand distribution of risk factors, treatment adherence and out of pocket expenses; facility audits to assess readiness of public and private facilities; in-depth interviews and focus group discussions to understand practices, myths and perceptions in the community. Chi-square tests were used to test differences between the groups. Framework analysis approach was used for qualitative analysis.
   Results: Twelve and 19% of the adult population had raised blood sugar and blood pressure, respectively, which increased with age, to 32 and 44% for over 50 years. 11% reported tobacco consumption; 5.5%, high alcohol consumption; 40%, inadequate physical activity and 81%, inappropriate diet consumption. These correlated strongly with elderly age and poor education. The public facilities lacked diagnostics and specialist services; care in the private sector was expensive. Qualitative data revealed fears and cultural myths that affected treatment adherence. The results informed intervention design across the NCD care continuum.
   Conclusions: The study provides tools and methodology to gather evidence in designing comprehensive NCD programmes in low and middle income settings. The study also provides important insights into public-private partnership driving effective NCD care at primary care level.

AB Background: The medical education system based on principles advocated by Flexner and Osler has produced generations of scientifically grounded and clinically skilled physicians whose collective experiences and contributions have served medicine and patients well. Yet sweeping changes launched around the turn of the millennium have constituted a revolution in medical education. In this article, a critique is presented of the new undergraduate medical education (UME) curricula in relationship to graduate medical education (GME) and clinical practice.
   Discussion: Medical education has changed and will continue to change in response to scientific advances and societal needs. However, enthusiasm for reform needs to be tempered by a more measured approach to avoid unintended consequences. Movement from novice to master in medicine cannot be rushed. An argument is made for a shoring up of biomedical science in revised curricula with the beneficiaries being nascent practitioners, developing physician-scientists -and the public.
   Conclusion: Unless there is further modification, the new integrated curricula are at risk of produce graduates deficient in the characteristics that have set physicians apart from other healthcare professionals, namely high-level clinical expertise based on a deep grounding in biomedical science and understanding of the pathologic basis of disease. The challenges for education of the best possible physicians are great but the benefits to medicine and society are enormous.

TI Economic evaluation of the introduction of the Prostate Health Index as
   a rule-out test to avoid unnecessary biopsies in men with prostate
   specific antigen levels of 4-10 in Hong Kong
SO PLOS ONE

AB A recent study showed that the Prostate Health Index may avoid unnecessary biopsies in men with prostate specific antigen 4-10ng/ml and normal digital rectal examination in the diagnosis of prostate cancer in Hong Kong. This study aimed to conduct an economic evaluation of the impact of adopting this commercially-available test in the Hong Kong public health service to determine whether further research is justified. A cost-consequence analysis was undertaken comparing the current diagnostic pathway with a proposed diagnostic pathway using the Prostate Health Index. Data for the model was taken from a prospective cohort study recruited at a single-institution and micro-costing studies. Using a cut off PHI score of 35 to avoid biopsy would cost HK$3,000 and save HK$7,988 per patient in biopsy costs and HK$511 from a reduction in biopsy-related adverse events. The net cost impact of the change was estimated to be HK$5,500 under base case assumptions. At the base case sensitivity and specificity for all grades of cancer (61.3% and 77.5% respectively) all grade cancer could be missed in 4.22% of the population and high grade cancer in 0.53%. The introduction of the prostate health index into the diagnostic pathway for prostate cancer in Hong Kong has the potential to reduce biopsies, biopsy costs and biopsy-related adverse events. Policy makers should consider the clinical and economic impact of this proposal.

AB Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) continue to be a major public health concern in the United Kingdom (UK). Epidemiological models have shown that narrowing the time between STI diagnosis and treatment may reduce the population burden of infection, and rapid, accurate point-of-care tests (POCTs) have potential for increasing correct treatment and mitigating the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). We developed the Precise social science programme to incorporate clinician and patient opinions on potential designs and implementation of new POCTs for multiple STIs and AMR detection. We conducted qualitative research, consisting of informal interviews with clinicians and semi-structured in-depth interviews with patients, in six sexual health clinics in the UK. Interviews with clinicians focused on how the new POCTs would likely be implemented into clinical care; these new clinical pathways were then posed to patients in in-depth interviews. Patient interviews showed acceptability of POCTs, however, willingness to wait in clinic for test results depended on the context of patients' sexual healthcare seeking. Patients reporting frequent healthcare visits often based their expectations and opinions of services and POCTs on previous visits. Patients' suggestions for implementation of POCTs included provision of information on service changes and targeting tests to patients concerned they are infected. Our data suggests that patients may accept new POCT pathways if they are given information on these changes prior to attending services and to consider implementing POCTs among patients who are anxious about their infection status and/or who are experiencing symptoms.

AB Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) are of global concern, as their presence is often associated with socio-economic and environmental issues including impacts on public health, aqua-culture and fisheries. Therefore, monitoring the occurrence and succession of HABs is fundamental for managing coastal regions around the world. Yet, due to the lack of adequate in situ measurements, the detection of HABs in coastal marine ecosystems remains challenging. Sensors on-board satellite platforms have sampled the Earth synoptically for decades, offering an alternative, cost-effective approach to routinely detect and monitor phytoplankton. The Red Sea, a large marine ecosystem characterised by extensive coral reefs, high levels of biodiversity and endemism, and a growing aquaculture industry, is one such region where knowledge of HABs is limited. Here, using high-resolution satellite remote sensing observations (1km, MODIS-Aqua) and a second-order derivative approach, in conjunction with available in situ datasets, we investigate for the first time the capability of a remote sensing model to detect and monitor HABs in the Red Sea. The model is able to successfully detect and generate maps of HABs associated with different phytoplankton functional types, matching concurrent in situ data remarkably well. We also acknowledge the limitations of using a remote-sensing based approach and show that regardless of a HAB's spatial coverage, the model is only capable of detecting the presence of a HAB when the Chl-a concentrations exceed a minimum value of similar to 1 mg m(-3). Despite the difficulties in detecting HABs at lower concentrations, and identifying species toxicity levels (only possible through in situ measurements), the proposed method has the potential to map the reported spatial distribution of several HAB species over the last two decades. Such information is essential for the regional economy (i.e., aquaculture, fisheries & tourism), and will support the management and sustainability of the Red Sea's coastal economic zone.

ID AMBULANCE SERVICES; DEMAND
AB In Japan, the increasing number of patients needing emergency medical care due to population aging is a major public health problem. Recently, emergency medicine in Japan has seen a growth in the number of Dedicated Emergency Physician Model style departments. We aimed to determine whether there is an association between Dedicated Emergency Physician Model emergency care and pre-hospital transportation time. We conducted a secondary analysis of a Japanese national pre-hospital database from 2010 to 2014. Three regions (group 1: Urayasu city and Ichikawa city in Chiba prefecture, group 2: Kamakura city, Chigasaki city, Fujisawa city and Zushi city in Kanagawa prefecture, and group 3: Fukui city in Fukui prefecture) were evaluated as Dedicated Emergency Physician Model emergency medicine areas. We compared transportation times in these areas with all municipalities in the same prefectures, and with a nearby area using multivariate linear regression with cluster adjustment. The variables used for adjustment are the time from Emergency Medical Services activation to the scene, month, day of the month, day of the week, time of day, age, gender, type of injury, severity, and location of call. Compared with all municipalities in each prefecture there were significant reductions in pre-hospital transportation time: 4.2 minutes (95% confidence interval, 0.9 to 7.5, p<0.05) in Group 1, 6.2 minutes (95%CI, 2.9 to 9.6, p<0.01) fin Group 2 and 7.5 minutes (95%CI, 6.0 to 9.0, p<0.01) in Group 3. Compared with nearby areas, there were statistically significant reductions in transportation time in Group 1, 6.8 minutes (95%CI, 0.7 to 12.8, p<0.05) and in Group 2, 6.8 minutes (95%CI, 3.7 to 9.9, p<0.05). There was a trend for reduced transportation time in Group 3, 2.3 minutes, (5.3 to -0.6, p<0.1). Areas with a Dedicated Emergency Physician Model are associated with reduced pre-hospital transportation time.

AB Aim
   Many older medical patients experience persistent functional limitations after hospitalization, such as dependency in activities of daily living, recurring fall incidents and increased mortality. Therefore, increased activity and mobilization during hospitalization are essential to prevent functional decline in older medical patients. No previous studies have explored how the social context influences how health professionals decide whether or not to mobilize patients. This qualitative study aimed to explore how social contextual circumstances affect the mobility of older medical patients in medical departments.
   Methods
   An ethnographic field study was conducted in six medical departments in three public hospitals in the capital region of Copenhagen, Denmark. Participant observations were carried out from January to June 2017. The researchers were present for up to 14 days (range, 8-14 days) in the six departments. A total of 210 pages of field notes were produced. The participants were health professionals involved in the care of older medical patients: physiotherapists, registered nurses, nursing assistants and physicians. A content analysis was conducted.
   Findings
   Five themes concerning mobility of patients emerged: (1) materialities; (2) professional roles; (3) encouraging moments; (4) patients and relatives; and (5) organization and management. Of these, professional roles seem to be the most important because it pervaded all themes. Different health professionals in the medical departments recognized, spoke and acted based on different cultural models.
   Conclusion
   It was found that mobility of older medical patients is entangled in a complex network of social contextual circumstances. Mobility of older medical patients is based on health professionals' different cultural models, which shape distinct professional identities and lead to contradictions and blurring of the priorities and responsibilities among the health professionals involved in mobilization. The consequence is that no profession "owns" the responsibility for mobilization, thus restricting mobilization of the patients during hospitalization.

AB Background: The needs of people with dementia (PWD) have not been assessed in any Latin American country. Several European countries have already related unmet needs with quality of life, caregiver's age, burden, stress, anxiety and depression. The aim of this study was to identify met and unmet needs in Chilean older adults with dementia and to determine if those needs were associated with PWD's, their informal caregivers' and social factors.
   Method: This was a cross-sectional study. One-hundred and sixty-six informal caregivers and their care recipients were interviewed. PWD was assessed about cognitive function and their caregivers answered instruments about PWD's needs, functional status and behavioral and psychological symptoms. Caregiver's burden, depression, anxiety and social support were also evaluated. A stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine predictors of unmet needs inChilean PWD.
   Results: The most frequent met needs were Looking after home (81.3%%), Food (78.9%) and Selfcare (75.3%). Most common unmet needs were Daily living activities (39.2%), Company (36.1%), and Memory (34.9%). Caregivers' lower age was correlated to ahigher number of PWD's unmet needs (r(s)=-.216; p<0.005). Higher PWD's dependence was associated with higher number of unmet needs (r(s)=.177; p<0.05). The best predictors of unmet needs were caregivers' low level of social support, high burden, young age and high level of anxiety.
   Conclusion: It is necessary to address psychological and social needs of PWD. The fact that PWD's unmet needs were associated mostly with caregivers' factors, highlights the importance of considering both, the PWD and their informal caregivers as targets of institutional support. It is expected that recently launched national public policies decrease PWD's unmet needs by the provision of new services for them and their informal caregivers.

AB Background: Globally, public housing is utilized to provide affordable housing for low-income households. Studies have shown an association between public housing and negative health outcomes. There is paucity of data pertaining to outpatient primary and tertiary healthcare resources utilization among public rental housing residents in Singapore.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed, involving patients under the care of SingHealth Regional Health System (SHRS) in Year 2012. Healthcare utilization outcomes evaluated included number of outpatient primary and specialist care clinic visits, emergency department visits and hospitalization in Year 2011. Multivariate logistical analyses were used to examine the association between public rental housing and healthcare utilization.
   Results: Of 147,105 patients, 10,400 (7.1%) patients stayed in public rental housing. There were more elderly (54.8 +/- 18.0 vs 49.8 +/- 17.1, p < 0.001) and male patients [5279 (50.8%) vs 56,892 (41.6%), p < 0.001] residing in public rental housing. Co-morbidities such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia were more prevalent among public rental housing patients. (p<0.05).
   After adjustment for covariates, public rental housing was not associated with frequent outpatient primary care clinic or specialist outpatient clinic attendances (p > 0.05). However, it was associated with increased number of emergency department visits (OR: 2.41, 95% CI: 2.12-2.74) and frequent hospitalization (OR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.33-1.83).
   Conclusion: Residing in public rental housing was not associated with increased utilization of outpatient healthcare resources despite patients' higher disease burden and frequency of emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Further research is required to elucidate their health seeking behaviours.

TI Household, maternal, and child related determinants of hemoglobin levels
   of Ethiopian children: hierarchical regression analysis
SO BMC PEDIATRICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Hemoglobin status; Anemia; Risk factors; Children
ID IRON SUPPLEMENTATION; ANEMIA; PREVALENCE; GROWTH
AB Background: Anemia remains a major public health problem among children under five years old in Ethiopia, rising unexpectedly from 44% national prevalence in 2011 to 57% in 2016. In this study, we investigated the household, maternal and child-related dietary and non-dietary factors associated with hemoglobin (Hb) level of infants and young children.
   Method: We analyzed data from a nationally representative sample of 2902 children aged 6-23 months, included in the 2016 Ethiopian demographic and health survey (EDHS). Hierarchical linear regression analysis was done to identify the factors associated with Hb level. We reported adjusted beta (a beta) with 95% confidence interval (CI).
   Result: Overall, 72% of children under 2 years of age were anemic in Ethiopia in 2016. Household factors: rich household wealth category (a beta = 0.48, 95%CI = 0.33-0.63, P < 0.001), and agrarian regions (a beta = 0.64, 95%CI = 0.40-0.88, P < 0.001) were significantly associated with a higher mean Hb level. Maternal factors: secondary and above education level (a beta = 0.69, 95%CI = 0.23-1.16, P = 0.004), and being not anemic (a beta = 0.40, 95%CI = 0.26-0.53, P < 0.001) were significantly associated with a higher mean Hb level. Child factors: age below 12 months (a beta = 0.72, 95%CI = 0.57-0.88, P < 0.001), female sex (a beta = 0.16, 95%CI = 0.03-0.30, P = 0.019), being not underweight (a beta = 0.22, 95%CI = 0.02-0.42, P = 0.031), average birth size (a beta = 0.25, 95%CI = 0.08-0.42, P = 0.003), no history of recent infection (a beta = 0.18, 95%CI = 0.02-0.33, P = 0.025), currently breastfeeding (a beta = 0.28, 95%CI = 0.12-0.44, P = 0.002), vitamin A supplementation (a beta = 0.17, 95%CI = 0.06-0.28, P = 0.021), and frequent meal feeding (a beta = 0.11, 95%CI = 0.05-0.16, P = 0.034) were significantly associated with a higher mean Hb level.
   Conclusion: Hb level was associated with various dietary and non-dietary influences originating from household, maternal, and child levels. A comprehensive approach, addressing the multi-factorial nature of Hb status, might stand an important consideration to reverse the recent rise in anemia prevalence in Ethiopia.

AB Background: Timely and complete vaccination with multi-dose schedules is of public health importance, because an incomplete vaccination series may yield suboptimal disease protection. However, data on adherence of adults to multi-dose vaccines are limited. We sought to estimate adherence to multi-dose hepatitis vaccination schedules among adults in the United Kingdom (UK).
   Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted using anonymized electronic health record (EHR) data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Individuals aged 19 years and older at their first identified dose of hepatitis vaccine (2009-2016) were included if they had continuous EHR data for 12 months before the first identified hepatitis A dose or for 6 months before the first identified hepatitis B or combination hepatitis A/B dose. We estimated dose and series completion for each vaccine and adherence to recommended vaccination schedules, as well asadherencewithin additional prespecified time periods after the first vaccine dose, with sensitivity analyses restricted to adults who had available data for up to 24 months after the first dose. Median time to series completion was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods.
   Results: Mean (SD) age at initiation was 42 (16) years for hepatitis A (n=374,881), 40 (16) years for hepatitis B (n=71,634), and 38 (15) years for hepatitis A/B (n=10,335). Women comprised 52 to 55% of each vaccine cohort. Overall, 42,294 adults (11%) completed the two-dose hepatitis A vaccine series within the recommended 12 months; and 15,564 (22%) and 1076 (10%) completed the three-dose hepatitis B and hepatitis A/B series, respectively, within the recommended 6 months. These percentages rose to only 23, 35, and 33%, respectively, when the follow-up periods were extended to 36 months for hepatitis A and to 30 months for hepatitis B and A/B vaccines. Median times to series completion within recommended schedules were not reached in any cohort. Sensitivity analyses supported the primary findings for the full cohorts.
   Conclusions: Adherence and series completion rates for hepatitis A and B vaccines in the UK are low. Identifying, understanding, and addressing barriers to series completion for multi-dose vaccines for adults in real-world settings are needed.

TI Factors associated with risk of HIV-infection among pregnant women in
   Cameroon: Evidence from the 2016 national sentinel surveillance survey
   of HIV and syphilis
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection (HIV) remains a public health concern in Cameroon that requires regular surveillance for informed policy-making to guide programmatic interventions. Using data from the 2016 HIV national sentinel survey in Cameroon, we ascertained HIV prevalence and factors associated with risk of infection among pregnant women
   Methods
   A cross-sectional study was conducted throughout 2016 in the 10 regions of Cameroon, targeting 7000 first antenatal care (ANC-1) attendees (4000 from urban and 3000 from rural areas) in 60 sentinel health facilities. HIV serological test was performed using the national serial algorithm at the National Reference Laboratory (NRL). Prevalence was determined, and multivariate logistic regression was used to assess determinants of HIV infection, with p-value<0.05 considered statistically significant.
   Results
   Of the 7000 targeted participants, a total of 6859 first ANC-1 attendees were enrolled (98.0% sampling coverage). Median age was 26 [IQR: 21-30] years and 47,40% had a secondary school level of education. The national prevalence of HIV was 5.70% (95% CI: 4.93-6.40) and range from 9.7% in East region to 2.6% in North region. The prevalence was 5.58% (95% CI: 95%: 4.88-6.35) in urban and 5.87% (95% CI: 5.04-6.78) in rural settings.
   Factors that were associated with HIV infection included marital status, women who were married or living with their partner are less likely to be infected than singles women (aOR = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.46-0.78), multiparity [aOR = 1.5(95% CI: 1.0-2.2)] and been living in the Centre, East, North-west and South-west regions. HIV infection was also significantly associated with age, with the risk of being infected increasing with age.
   Conclusion
   Pregnant women in Cameroon are still disproportionately infected with HIV compared with the general population (prevalence 4.3%). Preventive actions to curb the epidemic amongst pregnant women should prioritize interventions targeting single pregnant women, who are older, and residing particularly in the Centre, East, North West and South West regions of the country.

AB Background
   Involving community members in identifying and reporting health events for public health surveillance purposes, an approach commonly described as community-based surveillance (CBS), is increasingly gaining interest. We conducted a scoping review to list terms and definitions used to characterize CBS, to identify and summarize available guidance and recommendations, and to map information on past and existing in-country CBS systems.
   Methods
   We searched eight bibliographic databases and screened the worldwide web for any document mentioning an approach in which community members both collected and reported information on health events from their community for public health surveillance. Two independent reviewers performed double blind screening and data collection, any discrepancy was solved through discussion and consensus.
   Findings
   From the 134 included documents, several terms and definitions for CBS were retrieved. Guidance and recommendations for CBS were scattered through seven major guides and sixteen additional documents. Seventy-nine unique CBS systems implemented since 1958 in 42 countries were identified, mostly implemented in low and lower-middle income countries (79%). The systems appeared as fragmented (81% covering a limited geographical area and 70% solely implemented in a rural setting), vertical (67% with a single scope of interest), and of limited duration (median of 6 years for ongoing systems and 2 years for ended systems). Collection of information was mostly performed by recruited community members (80%).
   Interpretation
   While CBS has already been implemented in many countries, standardization is still required on the term and processes to be used. Further research is needed to ensure CBS integrates effectively into the overall public health surveillance system.

AB Background: Extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC) has become one of the most rapidly increasing malignancies in China during recent decades. The relationship between tobacco exposure and ECC epidemics is unclear; this study aimed to explore this relationship.
   Methods: We included 55,806 participants aged 30 years or older from the National Mortality and Smoking Survey of China. Smoking in participants and spouses was defined as 1 cigarette or more per day for up to 1 year. Spouses' smoking was taken as a measure of exposure to passive smoking. Smoking information in 1980 was ascertained and outcomes were defined as ECC mortality during 1986-1988.
   Results: We found that either passive or active smoking increased the risk of death from ECC by 20% (risk ratio [RR], 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99-1.47), compared with no exposure to any tobacco. This risk was a notable 98% (RR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.49-2.64) for individuals exposed to passive plus active smoking. These findings were highly consistent among men and women. Pathology-based analyses showed dose-response relationships of ECC with pack-years for all types of smoking exposure (Ps for trend < 0.05); the RR reached 2.75 (95% CI, 1.20-6.30) in individuals exposed to combined smoking with the highest exposure dose. The findings were similar for non-pathology-based analysis.
   Conclusions: This study indicates that tobacco exposure increases ECC risk. Given the dramatic increase of exposure to secondhand smoke and patients with ECC, an inadequate provision of smoke-free environments could be contributing to ECC epidemics and could further challenge public health and medical services, based on the current disease spectrum.

AB Background: In 2011 there was a strengthening of European Union (EU) legislation on the licencing of herbal products which, in the UK, resulted in the introduction of the Traditional Herbal Registration (THR) scheme. This scheme sets out standards for the safety and quality of herbal medicines and includes the provision of information to the customer on the safe use of the product.
   The aim of this study is to replicate a survey undertaken in 2011, prior to the implementation of the THR scheme, and evaluate the impact of this scheme on the information provided with herbal products bought over-the-counter.
   Methods: We undertook a survey on 5 herbal products commonly available over-the-counter (St John's wort, echinacea, Ginkgo biloba, Asian ginseng, garlic). The information was searched for key safety messages identified by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH). We also explored the presence of risk of harm information.
   Results: We recorded a rise in the number of products registered with the THR scheme (37% in 2016 compared to 7% in 2011). We also identified a reduction in the number of products that did not contain key safety information (75% in 2011 compared to 20% of products obtained in 2016). Risk of harm information was only communicated in products containing a PIL. We identified more products containing frequency of risk of harm information but this was not statistically significant.
   Conclusion: The introduction of the THR scheme appears to be associated with an increase in the provision of information about key safety messages on the safe use of herbal products. However, it is important to note that at least half of the products on the market that are not included in the THR scheme do not contain any information about their safe use; this includes information about precautions, interactions and side effects.
   The use of NCCIH herbal monographs replicated the methods used in the previous study; we recognise that the use of a different resource might effect the appraisal of the information provided. We also acknowledge that surveying presence of information does not assure that the latter is effectively communicated to patients, for which a close textual analysis would be required. While it is promising that more information is available after the introduction of the THR scheme, the public needs to be informed about ways to optimise safe use of all herbal products.

AB Background: Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is an important public health problem in Brazil and in several tropical regions of the world. In the Americas, Brazil is the country with the highest number of registered cases. In Brazil, the state of Minas Gerais has the highest number of cases in the southeastern region. In the present study, we used spatial analysis in the State of Minas Gerais to identify municipalities of priority during a nine-year period (2007-2015), which might be used to guide surveillance and control measures.
   Methods: An ecological study with spatial analysis of autochthonous cases of CL was performed in the state of Minas Gerais between 2007 and 2015. We calculated incidence rates, used Empirical Bayesian smoothing for each municipality, and divided the analyses into three-year intervals. In order to analyze the existence of spatial autocorrelation, and to define priority areas, Moran's Global Index and Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) were used.
   Results: The mean incidence rate for the entire state was 6.1/100,000 inhabitants. For Minas Gerais, analysis of CL cases over time revealed a successive increase of indicated mesoregions with high priority municipalities. Eight of the designated mesoregions contained municipalities classified as high priority areas in any of the three evaluated trienniums, and four mesoregions had high priority municipalities throughout the entire investigation.
   Conclusions: Within the southeastern region of Brazil, Minas Gerais State stands out, with highest CL incidence rates. Using spatial analysis, we identified an increasing numbers of cases in the municipalities classified as high priority areas in different mesoregions of the state. This information might be of value to direct surveillance and control measures against CL and to understand the dynamics of the expansion of CL in Minas Gerais. Similar approaches might be used to map CL in other regions throughout Brazil, or in any other country, where national notification and control programs exist.

ID POSTEXPOSURE REGIMEN; IMMUNIZATION; VACCINE; PREVENTION; AFRICA; DOGS
AB Background: Rabies remains a major public health problem in developing countries. Most fatal rabies cases, especially in children, result from dog bites and occur in low-income countries, such as those in Sub-Saharan Africa. Rabies can be controlled through mass dog vaccination and human deaths prevented through timely and appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). As access to appropriate PEP remains a serious challenge for bite-victims, the aim of this study was to understand the use of PEP, to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and practices with respect to rabies and to identify risk factors related to non-compliance with PEP to define recommendations for improving PEP in Senegal.
   Methods: This study included patients with suspicion of rabies exposure who sought PEP at the Pasteur Institute of Dakar from April 2013 to March 2014. Patients with rabies clinical symptoms, those who had already started PEP and those with exposure outside Senegal or for more than 3 months were excluded. Data on risk factors and propensity to seek and complete PEP were collected using questionnaires and phone interviews. The association between acceptability and compliance with PEP and other independent variables were evaluated using multivariate regression analysis.
   Results: Among the 905 patients enrolled into the study, 67% were male (sex ratio M/F, 2) and 46%, children under 15 years of age. Exposures by animal bites represented 87%, whereas the remainder were due to scratches or contact; 76% were classified as WHO category III and 88% were due to dogs. Among these patients, 7% refused to start PEP and 54.5% completed the full schedule. Main factors reported by non-compliant patients were vaccine costs and affordability, and knowledge on status of biting animal.
   Conclusion: This study shows that despite the awareness about rabies dangers and prevention, only half of the patients completed the full PEP schedule. The following recommendations, such as free of charge prophylaxis or intradermal regimens as an alternative to intramuscular regimens, should be considered to increase the adherence to PEP at the Pasteur Institute of Dakar and in Senegal.

ID RISK-FACTORS; SOUTH-AFRICA; TB; DEFAULT; PROGRAM; SUCCESS; IMPACT; CARE
AB Background: Drug resistant tuberculosis is a major public health problem in Morocco and worldwide. Treatment outcome of drug resistant tuberculosis is poor and requires a long period of treatment with many toxic and expensive antituberculosis drugs. The aim of this study is to evaluate treatment outcomes of drug resistant tuberculosis and to determine predictors of poor treatment outcomes in a large region of Morocco.
   Methods: It is a multi-centric observational cohort study conducted from January 01, 2014 to January 01, 2016. A questionnaire was established to collect data from clinical charts of patients with confirmed resistant TB. The study was carried out in all the 11 centers located in the Rabat-Sale-Kenitra region of Morocco where drug resistant tuberculosis is treated. Treatment outcomes were reported and the definitions and classifications of these outcomes were defined according to the WHO guidelines. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were conducted to determine factors associated with poor drug resistant tuberculosis treatment outcomes in Morocco.
   Results: In our study, 101 patients were treated for drug resistant tuberculosis between January 01, 2014 and January 01, 2016. Patients' age ranged from 9.5 to 70 years; 72 patients (71.3%) were male and 80 patients (79.2%) were living in urban areas. Thirty two patients were smokers, 74 patients had multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, 25 patients had rifampicin resistance and 2 patients had isoniazid resistance. Treatment outcomes of tuberculosis patients were as follows: 45 patients were cured (44.5%), 9 completed treatment (8.9%), 5 patients died before completing the treatment, 35 patients were lost to follow up (34.6%) and 7 patients had treatment failure. In the multivariate analysis, being a smoker is an independent risk factor for poor treatment outcomes, (p-value = 0.015, OR = 4.355, IC [1.327-14.292]).
   Conclusion: Treatment success outcomes occurred in more than half of the cases, which is lower than the World Health Organization target of at least a 75% success rate. A significant number of patients abandoned their treatment before its completion. These dropouts are a serious public health hazard that needs to be addressed urgently.

AB Background: Place-based factors have been implicated as root causes of socioeconomic disparities in risky health behaviors such as tobacco and alcohol use. Yet few studies examine the effects of county-level socioeconomic characteristics, despite the fact that social and public health policies are often implemented at the county level. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that county-level socioeconomic disadvantage was associated with individual tobacco and alcohol use.
   Methods: The sample included a panel of participants from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (N=9302). The primary predictors were three time-varying measures of socioeconomic disadvantage in an individual's county of residence: educational attainment, percent unemployment, and per capita income. We first conducted traditional ordinary least squares (OLS) models, both unadjusted and adjusted for individual-level covariates. We then conducted fixed effects (FE) models to adjust for confounding by unmeasured time-invariant individual-levelfactors.
   Results: OLS and FE models yielded contrasting results: higher county-level per capita income was associated with decreased drinking in OLS models and increased drinking in FE models, while decreased county-level educational attainment was associated with decreased smoking in OLS models and more cigarettes per day in FE models. The findings from FE models suggest that OLS models were confounded by unobserved time-invariant characteristics. Notably, the point estimates for the county-level measures were small, and in many cases they may not represent a clinically meaningful effect except at the population level.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that county-level socioeconomic characteristics may modestly influence tobacco and alcohol use. Future work should examine the effects of specific county policies that might explain these findings.

AB Background: Physical literacy (PL), given as a multidimensional construct, is considered a person's capacity and commitment to a physically active lifestyle. We investigated the effect of a holistic physical exercise training on PL among physically inactive adults.
   Methods: A non-randomised controlled study was conducted. Thirty-one physically inactive adults in the intervention group (IG; 81% females, 44 +/- 16 years) participated in a holistic physical exercise training intervention once weekly for 15 weeks. A matched, non-exercising control group (CG) consisted of 30 physically inactive adults (80% female, 45 +/- 11 years). PL, compliance and sociodemographic parameters were measured. PL was evaluated by a questionnaire, covering five domains: physical activity behaviour, attitude towards a physically active lifestyle, exercise motivation, knowledge and self-confidence/self-efficacy. Data were analysed using ANCOVA models, adjusted for age, gender and BMI at baseline.
   Results: At post-training intervention, the IG showed significant improvements in PL (p=0.001) and in the domains physical activity behaviour (p=0.02) and exercise self-confidence/self-efficacy (p=0.001), with no changes overserved for the CG regarding PL and those domains. No intervention effect were found for the other three domains, i.e. attitude, knowledge and motivation. Additionally, for the IG baseline BMI was identified to be positively correlated with physical exercise-induced improvements in PL (beta=0.51, p=0.01).
   Conclusions:The results from this study are very useful for further public health activities, which aim at helping physically inactive adults to adopt a physically active lifestyle as well as for the development of further PL intervention strategies. This pilot-study was a first attempt to measure PL in inactive adults. Yet, a validated measurement tool is still not available. Further research is necessary to determine the psychometric properties for this PL questionnaire.

   PAPER TOWEL; DRYER; CONTAMINATION; EFFICACY
AB Background: The hand hygiene (HH) behaviour of the general public and its effect on illnesses are issues of growing importance. Gender is associated with HH behaviour. HH efficiency is a combination of washing efficiency and hand drying, but information about the knowledge level and HH behaviour of the general public is relatively limited. The findings of this cross-sectional study can substantially contribute to the understanding on the knowledge gap and public behaviour towards HH, thereby providing information on gender-specific health promotion activities and campaigns to improve HH compliance.
   Methods: An epidemiological investigation by using a cross-sectional study design on the general public was conducted either via an online platform (SurveyMonkey) or paper-and-pen methods. The hand-washing and -drying questionnaire was used for data collection.
   Results: A total of 815 valid questionnaires were collected. Majority of the respondents can differentiate the diseases that can or cannot be transmitted with poor HH, but the HH knowledge of the respondents was relatively inadequate. The female respondents had a significantly better HH knowledge than male respondents. The multiple regression analysis results also indicated that females had a significantly higher knowledge score by 0.288 towards HH than males after adjusting for age and education level. Although the majority of the respondents indicated that they performed hand cleaning under different specific situations, they admitted only using water instead of washing their hands with soap. More males than females dried their hands on their own clothing, whereas more females dried their hands through air evaporation. The average time of using warm hand dryers was generally inadequate amongst the respondents.
   Conclusions: Being a female, middle-aged and having tertiary education level are protective factors to improve HH knowledge. Misconceptions related to the concepts associated with HH were noted amongst the public. Self-reported practice on hand drying methods indicated that additional education was needed. The findings of this study can provide information on gender-specific health promotion activities and creative campaigns to achieve sustained improvement in HH practices.

AB Background: Both child under- and over-nutrition are major global public health challenges. We aimed to examine thirty-year trends in physical growth, under- and over-nutrition in Chinese urban and suburban children between 1985 and 2015, and discuss implications for child health programmes.
   Methods: A total of 610,785 urban and suburban children from birth to 7 years of age were collected from a series of large-scale national surveys in China. Height, weight and body mass index (BMI) Z-scores and prevalence of stunting, underweight, wasted and possible risk of overweight, overweight and obesity were calculated according to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2006 growth standards. The trends in the prevalence were tested across different survey years by Cochran-Armitage trend test.
   Results: Rapid secular growth trend was observed in China over the past 30 years, but the trend showed a slowing sign in urban children in recent 10 years. The growth level of Chinese urban and suburban children surpassed the WHO 2006 growth standards in 2015. Between 1985 and 2015 the stunting, underweight and wasted prevalence decreased from 12.21, 4.44, 1.68 to 0.97%, 0.59, 0.87% for children under 5 years and from 12.69, 10.02, 3.41 to 0.42%, 0.67, 2.17% for children aged 5- < 7 respectively; the possible risk of overweight prevalence increased from 6.51 to 12.57%, overweight from 0.70 to 3.48% and obesity from 0.17 to 0.86% for children aged 2- < 7 and the increasing rates of overweight and obesity prevalence in suburban children first outnumbered urban children in recent 10 years. The overweight prevalence overtook the wasted or underweight in children aged 2 <7 in 2005 and onward.
   Conclusion: Slowing secular height trend and overweight prevalence overtaking the wasted or underweight suggested child nutrition and health strategies should adjust swiftly and deliberately from primarily reducing under-nutrition prevalence to controlling rapid weight gain and promoting integrated early development.

AB Background
   With an estimated 27 million annual incidents of maternal morbidity globally, how they are manifested or experienced is diverse and shaped by societal, cultural and personal influences. Using qualitative research to examine a woman's perception of her pregnancy, its complications, and potential long-term impact on her life can inform public health approaches and complement and inform biomedical classifications of maternal morbidities, historically considered a neglected dimension of safe motherhood. As part of the WHO's Maternal Morbidity Working Group's efforts to define and measure maternal morbidity, we carried out a thematic analysis of the qualitative literature published between 1998 and 2017 on how women experience maternal morbidity in low and lower-middle income countries.
   Results and conclusions
   Analysis of the 71 papers included in this study shows that women's status, their marital relationships, cultural attitudes towards fertility and social responses to infertility and pregnancy trauma are fundamental to determining how they will experience morbidity in the pregnancy and postpartum periods. We explore the physical, economic, psychological and social repercussions pregnancy can produce for women, and how resource disadvantage (systemic, financial and contextual) can exacerbate these problems. In addition to an analysis of ten themes that emerged across the different contexts, this paper presents which morbidities have received attention in different regions and the trends in researching morbidities over time. We observed an increase in qualitative research on this topic, generally undertaken through interviews and focus groups. Our analysis calls for the pursuit of high quality qualitative research that includes repeat interviews, participant observation and triangulation of sources to inform and fuel critical advocacy and programmatic work on maternal morbidities that addresses their prevention and management, as well as the underlying systemic problems for women's status in society.

AB Purpose
   To examine the impacts of socio-economic status (SES) on visual impairment (VI), and the mediating role of lifestyles in developed rural areas of China.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional study was conducted among people living in rural districts of Tianjin, a developed municipality in China. An interviewer-administered survey along with free eye screenings was conducted with participants. The questionnaire included questions about demographic characteristics, SES, medical histories and lifestyles. Presenting visual acuity (PVA) and main causes of VI were identified by ophthalmologists chi(2) test was undertaken to determine whether significant differences (p<0.05) exist between VI and demographic, SES, medical history and lifestyle factors. A stepwise regression method was conducted to investigate whether lifestyles play mediating roles between SES and VI. Multivariable logistic and ordinal logistic regression were used contingent on different types of dependent variables in each regression, and adjusted odds ratio (OR) values were estimated.
   Results
   Of the 12,233 participants, 6,233 were male (50.59%); the mean age was 34.61 years; 310 (2.54%) had VI. Hypertension, diabetes and cardiopathy were main medical histories, with 1,640 had hypertension (13.41%), 854 had diabetes (6.98%) and 483 had cardiopathy (3.95%). About SES factors, higher education level (Adjusted OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75-0.95) and higher income level (Adjusted OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.39-0.76), were significantly associated with VI in a gradient across severity of VI. Lifestyles including smoking (Adjusted OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.31-1.83) and drinking (Adjusted OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.06-1.74) played mediating roles between SES and VI when considering the full sample. Besides smoking and drinking, reading every week (Adjusted OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.53-2.82) and exercising more than 2h every day (Adjusted OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.15-1.00) also played mediating roles between SES and VI when considering the subsample (age >= 16).
   Conclusion
   This study revealed the crucial impacts of SES factors on VI, and the mediating role played by several lifestyles. Targeted public health interventions for reducing VI should thus be proposed in developed rural areas of China.

AB Background: Obesity is a major public health concern in the United States and should be addressed as early as possible, in childhood. Disparities exist in obesity prevalence and its associated comorbidities by racial/ethnic group, however less is known about the smaller racial/ethnic subclasses that are often aggregated and assumed to be homogeneously at risk. As the racial and ethnic composition of the US shifts towards greater diversity, it is important that epidemiologic research addresses these new challenges.
   Main body: In this short communication, we focus on Asian American children given that subgroups are historically understudied and emerging evidence among adults suggest heterogeneous associations for both obesity and cardio-metabolic outcomes. Existing limitations in this research area include: (1) identifying the appropriate measurement of adiposity in Asian American children; (2) determining high-risk cutoffs for intervention; and (3) developing strategies to ensure study robustness.
   Conclusion: Data disaggregation is a necessary approach to understand potentially heterogeneous associations in childhood obesity and cardio-metabolic risk, but epidemiologic investigators must address these challenges. Ultimately, successful strategies could help better identify high risk subgroups, target interventions, and effectively reduce the burden of obesity among American youth.

AB Despite the removal of user fees on public primary healthcare in Zambia, prior studies suggest that out-of-pocket payments are still significant. However, we have little understanding of the extent to which out-of-pocket payments lead patients to hardship methods of financing out-of-pocket costs. This study analyses the prevalence and determinants of hardship financing arising from out-of-pocket payments in healthcare, using data from a nationally-representative household health expenditure survey conducted in 2014. We employ a sequential logistic regression model to examine the factors associated with the risk of hardship financing conditional on reporting an illness and an out-of-pocket expenditure. The results show that up to 11% of households who reported an illness had borrowed money, or sold items or asked a friend for help, or displaced other household consumption in order to pay for health care. The risk of hardship financing was higher among the poorest households, female headed-households and households who reside further from health facilities. Improvements in physical access and quality of public health services have the potential to reduce the incidence of hardship financing especially among the poorest.

AB Introduction
   Chronic energy deficiency is an important public health problem among older (aged >= 65 years) population. Globally, one in seven older people has a medium to high risk of malnutrition. The situation of chronic energy deficiency among older people is quite poorly known in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was aimed to determine the magnitude of chronic energy deficiency and associated factors among elders' aged >= 65 years, in Aykel town administration, Amhara Regional State, Northwest Ethiopia.
   Methods
   A community based cross-sectional survey was carried out from March 28th to April 20th, 2018. Study participants were recruited by a census technique. Both bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis used to identify factors associated with chronic energy deficiency. All variables with p-values of < 0.2 in the bivariate analysis were remarked for the multivariable analysis. Both Crude Odds Ratio (COR) and Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) were computed to determine the strength of association. In the multivariate analysis, all variables at p-values of < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.
   Results
   A total of 892 participants recruited for the study. The prevalence of chronic energy deficiency was 17.6% (95% CI: 15.00, 20.20) among the study community. It was significantly associated with female sex (AOR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.04, 2.41), age (AOR: 3.90; 95% CI: 1.85, 8.25), household food insecurity (AOR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.16, 3.00), poor household wealth status (AOR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.07, 2.94), loss of appetite due to illness (AOR: 2.93, 95% CI: 1.92, 4.48) and poor dietary diversity score (AOR: 5.51; 95% CI: 2.89, 10.52).
   Conclusions
   The magnitude of chronic energy deficiency was high in the study area. It was significantly associated with female sex, age, poor dietary diversity score, loss of appetite due to illness, household food insecurity and poor wealth status. Therefore, there is a need to design and implement programs and strategies to improve nutritional status particularly focusing on female older population in improving dietary practices and food security. In addition, improving household economic and living standards is an essential measure to address the burden of CED among the older community.

ID VIRUS INFECTION; PREVALENCE
AB Background and aim
   Infection at birth due to mother-to-child (MTC) transmission is the most common cause of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Vietnam. This study was undertaken to examine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of pregnant women and mothers in Vietnam concerning HBV prevention and immunization.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Quang Ninh and Hoa Binh provinces in 2017. A standardized questionnaire was administered to women when they received care at primary and tertiary maternal health clinics. Multivariate regression was used to identify predictors of HBV knowledge and practices.
   Results
   Among the 380 women surveyed, 50.3% were pregnant and 49.7% were postpartum. Despite 70.3% of participants reported having received information about HBV during their pregnancy, only 10.8% provided correct answers to all questions regarding HBV transmission routes and preventive measures. Around half of the participants incorrectly believed that HBV is transmitted through sneezing, contaminated water or sharing foods with chronic HBV patients. Although 86.1% of participants believed that HBV vaccination is necessary for infants, only 66.1% responded they were definitely willing to have their own child vaccinated within 24 hours. More than a third of participants expressed concern about having casual contacts or sharing foods with chronic HBV patients. In multivariate analysis, having received information about HBV during their pregnancy was significantly associated with better HBV knowledge score. Delivery at provincial level clinics was a strong predictor for perinatal HBV screening and hepatitis B birth dose administration.
   Conclusions
   The results highlight the need to prioritize educating pregnant women and mothers in future public health campaigns in order to increase knowledge, reduce misperception, and improve hepatitis B vaccine birth dose coverage in Vietnam.

   FACILITY; OUTCOMES; DELAYS; RISK
AB Background
   Maternal mortality is among the most important public health concerns in Sub-Saharan Africa. There is limited data on hospital-based maternal mortality in Tanzania. The objective of this study was to determine the causes and maternal mortality trends in public hospitals of Tanzania from 2006-2015.
   Methods and findings
   This retrospective study was conducted between July and December 2016 and involved 34 public hospitals in Tanzania. Information on causes of deaths due to pregnancy and delivery complications among women of child-bearing age (15-49 years old) recorded for the period of 2006-2015 was extracted. Data sources included inpatient and death registers and International Classification of Disease (ICD)-10 report forms. Maternal deaths were classified based on case definition by ICD 10 and categorized as direct and indirect causes. A total of 40,052 deaths of women of child-bearing age were recorded. There were 1,987 maternal deaths representing 5.0% of deaths of all women aged 15-49 years. The median age-at-death was 27 years (interquartile range: 22, 33). The average age-at-death increased from 25 years in 2006 to 29 years in 2015. Two thirds (67.1%) of the deaths affected women aged 20-34 years old. The number of deaths associated with teenage pregnancy (15-19 years) declined significantly (p-value<0.001) from 17.8% in 2006-2010 to 11.1% in 2011-2015. The proportion of deaths among 30-34 and 35-39 years old (all together) increased from 13% in 2006-2010 to 15.3% in 2011-2015 (p-value = 0.081). Hospital-based maternal mortality ratio increased from 40.24 (2006) to 57.94/100000 births in 2015. Of the 1,987 deaths, 83.8% were due to direct causes and 16.2% were due to indirect causes. Major direct causes were eclampsia (34.0%), obstetric haemorrhage (24.6%) and maternal sepsis (16.7%). Anaemia (14.9%) and cardiovascular disorders (14.0%) were the main indirect causes. Causes of maternal deaths were highly related; being attributed to up to three direct causes (0.12%). Cardiovascular disorders and anaemia had strong linkage with haemorrhage. While there was a decline in the number of deaths due to eclampsia and abortion, those due to haemorrhage and cardiovascular disoders increased during the period.
   Conclusions
   During the ten year period (2006-2015) there was an increase in the number of hospital maternal deaths in public hospitals in Tanzania. Maternal deaths accounted for 5% of all women of child-bearing age in-hospital mortalities. Most maternal deaths were due to direct causes including eclampsia, haemorrhage and sepsis. The findings of this study provide evidence for better planning and policy formulation for reproductive health programmes to reduce maternal deaths in Tanzania.

AB Metabolic disorders are prevalent worldwide and have recently become public health problems recently. Previous studies have proposed different body composition indices for predicting future cardiovascular risks. We hypothesized an association among fat-to-muscle ratio (FMR), metabolic syndrome (MetS), hypertension (HTN), prediabetes, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), and cardiovascular risk in an adult population. A total of 66829 eligible subjects composed of 34182 males and 32647 females aged 20 years or older were obtained from health examinations in the Tri-Service General Hospital from 2011 to 2017. The body composition indices included fat and muscle mass measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis. A multivariable regression model was performed in a large population-based cross-sectional study. FMR was significantly associated with MetS, prediabetes, DM and HTN in all models of both genders. Based on quartile analysis, higher FMR had higher predictive ability for adverse health outcomes. The association between different definitions of MetS and the Framingham risk score was analyzed, and FMR-incorporated MetS was more useful for predicting higher Framingham risk scores than traditional definitions. FMR was a useful indicator for the presence of adverse cardiometabolic risks. Compared to traditional definition of MetS, FMR-incorporated MetS had a greater ability to predict incident cardiovascular risks. FMR seemed to be a simple and effective index for the early prevention and management of cardiometabolic events.

TI To prescribe or not to prescribe? A factorial survey to explore

AB Resistance to antimicrobials is one of the biggest challenges worldwide for public health. A key strategy for tackling this is ensuring judicious use of antimicrobials in human and veterinary medicine. Whilst there are many studies in human medicine investigating prescribing behaviour of doctors, there is limited work to understand what factors influence veterinarian prescribing behaviour. Veterinarians often prescribe antimicrobials to sheep and beef farmers in contexts other than at a clinical consultation, and decision-making behind this has not been explored. The aim of this study was to measure, for the first time, the influence of factors from social theories on veterinarians' decision to prescribe antimicrobials to sheep and beef farmers without a clinical consultation, using a factorial survey approach. Respondents were presented with eight vignette scenarios, where a farmer asks for antimicrobials at the veterinary practice. Seven factors, identified from constructs of social theories, were included in the vignettes. Random intercept and random slope models were built to estimate the effects of the vignette factors and vet characteristics on the respondents' willingness to prescribe ratings. A total of 306 surveys were completed. The vignette factors: case type, farmer relationship, other veterinarians in practice, time pressure, habit, willingness to pay, and confidence in the farmer, were significant in the decision to prescribe. Confidence in the farmer was the most influential vignette variable, and was included as a random slope effect. Respondent variables with significant influence on the decision to prescribe were agreeableness personality score, region of veterinary practice, and presence of a small animal department. These influential factors could be considered to target interventions in beef and sheep farm animal veterinary practice for improved antimicrobial stewardship.

AB BackgroundThe demand for smoking cessation services has risen in Turkey, as smokers planning to quit reached 35% in 2012. Communication technologies are used globally to support quitters, yet their integration to health services is rare. This study aims to evaluate the effect of support messages through WhatsApp application added to the usual care of a university hospital cessation unit, as compared to usual care alone, on abstinence rates at first month.MethodsA randomized controlled intervention study was conducted with 132 patients applying to Ege University Hospital's Department of Public Health Smoking Cessation Clinic, between March and July 2017. Intervention content was prepared and 60 WhatsApp messages about having a plan of action and preventing relapse were developed through expert panels. These messages lasted for 3months and follow-ups continued for 6months. The primary outcome was abstinence rate at 1st month post target quit day. As secondary outcomes; the continuous abstinence rates at 3rd and 6th months, number of follow-ups, change in weight and continuity of medication were evaluated. Intention-to-treat analysis was used.ResultsAbstinence rate at 1st month was 65.9% in the intervention group and 40.9% in the control group (p=0.007); 50.0 and 30.7% at 3rd month and 40.9 and 22.7% at 6th month, consecutively (both p<0.05). Being in the intervention group increased abstinence rate by 3.50 (OR, 95% CI=1.30-9.44) times in the 1st month. When controlled for all other factors in the multivariate logistic regression, the intervention was the only variable significantly associated with abstinence. For secondary outcomes, the intervention increased abstinence rate by 2.50 (OR, 95% CI=1.08-6.40) times in the 3rd and 2.31 (OR, 95% CI=1.03-5.16) times in the 6th month. In the intervention group, the number of follow-ups and face-to-face follow-ups were higher at 1st and 3rd months and continuity of medication was longer at 3rd month.ConclusionsWhatsApp support embedded in cessation service delivery increases the abstinence rate and has favorable effects on follow-up.Trial registrationThis trial is retrospectively registered online at ClinicalTrials.gov with the identifier NCT03714971.

AB BackgroundPreventing intimate partner violence or dating violence (DV) among adolescents is a public health priority due to its magnitude and damaging short and long-term consequences for adolescent and adult health. In our study protocol, we complement prior experiences in DV prevention by promoting protective factors (or assets) against gender violence such as communication skills, empathy and problem-solving capability through Cinema Voice, a participatory educational intervention based on adolescents' strengths to tackle DV.Methods/designA longitudinal quasi-experimental educational intervention addressed to boys and girls ages 13-17years, enrolled in secondary education schools in Alicante (Spain), Rome (Italy), Cardiff (UK), Iasi (Romania), Poznan (Poland) and Matosinhos (Portugal). Both process and results evaluations will be carried out with 100-120 intervention and 120-150 control group students per city at three time periods: before, after and 6 months after the implementation of the following interventions: 1) Training seminar with teachers to promote knowledge and skills on the core issues of intervention; 2) Workshops with intervention groups, where participants produce their own digital content presenting their perspective on DV; and 3) Short film exhibitions with participants, their families, authorities and other stakeholders with the objective of share the results and engage the community. Outcome measures are self-perceived social support, machismo, sexism, tolerance towards gender violence, social problem-solving and assertiveness as well as involvement in bullying/cyberbullying. Other socio-demographic, attitudes and violence-related co-variables were also included.DiscussionThis study may provide relevant information about the effectiveness of educational interventions that combine a positive youth development framework with educational awareness about the importance of achieving gender equality and preventing and combating gender violence. To our knowledge, this is the first study that involves six European countries in an educational intervention to promote violence protective assets among enrolled adolescents in secondary schools. This study may provide the needed tools to replicate the experience in other contexts and other countries.Trial registrationClinicaltrials.gov: NCT03411564. Unique Protocol ID: 776905.

TI Diversity of HIV-1 genotypes and high prevalence of pretreatment drug

DT Article
DE HIV-1; AIDS; Genotype; Pretreatment drug resistance; Mutation
AB BackgroundGenetic variability and liability to develop drug-resistant mutations are the main characteristics of HIV-1, which can not only increase the risk of antiretroviral treatment (ART) failure, but also can lead to the spread of resistant strains. We aim to investigate the distribution of HIV-1 genotypes and prevalence of pretreatment drug resistance (PDR) in ART-naive HIV-1 infected patients in Shanghai China.MethodsA cross-sectional study was performed among the newly diagnosed ART-naive HIV-1 infected patients during the period from January 2017 to November 2017 in Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. The target fragment of 1316bp in the pol gene spanning the reverse transcriptase and protease regions was amplified using a nested polymerase chain reaction. HIV-1 genotypes were determined by phylogenetic analysis, and PDR associated mutations were determined according to Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database (http://hivdb.stanford.edu/).ResultsWe successfully amplified pol gene sequences from blood samples of 317 patients, of whom 95.3% were male, and 68.8% were men who have sex with men. The median age was 33years; and the median CD4 count was 275 cells/L. The predominant HIV-1 genotype was circulating recombinant form (CRF) 01_AE (53.0%, 168/317), followed by CRF07_BC (29.7%, 94/317), B (7.6%, 24/317), CRF08_BC (1.9%, 6/317), CRF55_01B (1.9%, 6/317), CRF 59_01B (0.9%, 3/317). In addition, 5% (16/317) HIV-1 strains were identified as other subtypes or CRFs/URFs (unique recombinant forms). The overall prevalence of PDR was 17.4% (55/317). PDR frequency to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI, 16.4%) was much higher than that to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI, 4.7%) and protease inhibitor (PI, 0.6%). The most common HIV-1 mutation pattern for NNRTI and NRTI were V179D/E (10.1%, 32/317) and M184V (2.8%, 9/317), respectively. About half (49.1%, 27/55) of the HIV-1 strains with mutation presented as potential low-level resistant to NNRTI attributed to V179D/E.ConclusionThe distribution of HIV-1 genotypes in Shanghai China is diverse and complex. The high prevalence of PDR highlights the significance of baseline HIV-1 drug resistance testing. Non-NNRTI-containing regimen may be the preferred initial therapy for newly diagnosed HIV-1 patients in Shanghai in the absence of PDR test results.

AB Background: It has been suggested that an increasing number of Japanese adults remain sexually inexperienced; however, no study has assessed this issue using nationally representative data.
   Methods: We used data from seven rounds of the National Fertility Survey of Japan, 1987-2015, and included adults aged 18-39 years (18-34 years in the 1987 survey) in the analyses (sample size 11,553-17,850 [1987-2010]; response rate 70.0-92.5%). For each survey year, sex and age group, we estimated the age-adjusted prevalence of heterosexual inexperience, defined as reporting no experience of sexual intercourse with someone of the opposite sex. We used logistic regression, adjusted for age, to identify factors associated with heterosexual inexperience in the 2010 survey. Information about same-sex sexual experience was not available.
   Results: Between 1992 and 2015, the age-standardized prevalence of heterosexual inexperience in adults aged 18-39 years increased from 21.7 to 24.6% for women (p-values for linear and quadratic trend < 0.05) and from 20.0 to 25.8% for men (p-values for trend < 0.05). Among those aged 30-34 years, the prevalence was 6.2% in 1987 and 11. 9% in 2015 for women (p-values for trend >= 0.05) and 8.8% (1987) and 12.7% (2015) for men (p-values for trend >= 0.05). Among those aged 35-39 years, prevalence increased from 4.0% in 1992 to 8.9% in 2015 among women (p-values for trend >= 0.05). The corresponding numbers for men in the same age group were 5.5 and 9.5%, respectively (p-values for trend >= 0.05). Among men aged 25-39 years, unemployment, temporary/part-time employment and lower income were associated with heterosexual inexperience.
   Conclusions: The proportion of young Japanese adults with no experience of heterosexual intercourse had increased in the past two decades. Among adults in their thirties, around one in ten had no heterosexual experience. Unemployment, temporary/part-time employment and low income were associated with heterosexual inexperience among men. Further research is needed on the factors contributing to and the potential public health and demographic implications of the high proportion of the Japanese population that remains sexually inexperienced well into adult age.

DE Peak flow meter; Accuracy; CE; Asthma
AB BackgroundThe study evaluates and compares the accuracy of nine peak flow meters (PFMs) and spirometers that are currently available in Europe and have Conformite Europeene (CE) marking. The CE marking is a manufacturer's declaration that their product complies with European health regulations and it is a requirement for marketing medical devices in Europe.MethodsThe nine devices were selected as they all had received or were in the process of receiving CE approval in Europe and were readily obtainable. The devices were bench tested following the ISO 23747:2015 accuracy guidelines for medical devices measuring peak flow. All standards, including accuracy, from these guidelines must be met to obtain CE marking.This study was performed with a certified piston pump testing apparatus. The apparatus chosen was the pulmonary waveform generator manufactured by Piston Medical Ltd. Using predefined flow (time) and volume (time) waveforms, peak flow meters and spirometers were tested for validation and calibration. Three CE guideline tests were utilised, and standards require that all three tests are passed for the device to obtain certification.ResultsOf the nine devices that were tested, two passed and seven failed. The devices that passed the tests were the Smart Peak Flow (R) and the Mini Wright (R).ConclusionsA high percentage of devices failed accuracy testing in this study. This is a concern as the CE marking is a manufacturer's certification documenting the accuracy, reliability and safety of devices. Of the seven devices that failed all have the CE marking. All tested devices are on the market in Europe based upon studies conducted by each of the manufacturers. The data used to obtain CE certification of these devices, however, are not in the public domain.

AB Background: Delay in healthcare seeking and loss to diagnostic follow-up (LDFU) contribute to substantial increase in tuberculosis (TB) morbidity and mortality. We examined factors, including perceived causes and prior help seeking, contributing to delay and LDFU during referral to a TB clinic among patients with presumptive TB initially seeking help at the pharmacies in Dar es Salaam Tanzania.
   Methods: In a TB clinic, a semi-structured interview based on the explanatory model interview catalogue (EMIC) framework for cultural epidemiology was administered to presumptive TB patients enrolled at pharmacies during an intervention study. We assessed delay in seeking care at any medical care provider for a period of >= 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms, LDFU during referral (not reaching the TB clinic), and LDFU for three required TB clinic visits among the presumptive and confirmed TB patients. Logistic regression models were used to assess factors associated with delay and LDFU.
   Results: Among 136 interviewed patients, 86 (63.2%) were LDFU from pharmacies and TB clinic while 50 (36.8%) were non-LDFU. Out of 136 patients 88 (64.7%) delayed seeking care, of whom 59 (67%) were females. Among the 86 (63.2%) patients in LDFU group, 62 (72.1%) delayed seeking care, while among the 50 (36.8%) non-LDFU, 26 (52.0%) had also delayed seeking care. Prior consultation with a traditional healer (aOR 2.84, 95% CI 1.08-7.40), perceived causes as ingestion (water and food) (aOR 0.38 CI 0.16-0.89), and substance use (smoking and alcohol) (aOR 1.45 CI 0.98-2.14) were all associated with patient delay. Female gender was associated with LDFU (aOR 3.80, 95% CI 1.62-8.87) but not with delay. Other conditions as prior illness and heredity were also associated with LDFU but not delay (aOR 1.48 CI 1.01-2.17).
   Conclusion: Delay and LDFU after referral from the pharmacies were substantial. Notable effects ofdiagnosis and female gender indicate a need for more attention to women's health to promote timely and sustained TB treatment. Public awareness to counter misconceptions about the causes of TB is needed.

AB BackgroundChina has the largest number of cases of diabetes with a high rate of uncontrolled blood sugar. Many studies show that family members' involvement is related to better glycemic control. However, there is a significant problem with low participation of family members. The widespread use of WeChat provides an opportunity for family members to support their diabetic loved ones in their type 2 diabetes self-management practices. The main aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a family-based intervention via WeChat.MethodsA parallel, two-group, randomized controlled trial will be conducted in the central urban area of Jiading district in Shanghai, China. A total of 222 type 2 diabetics will be randomly divided into an intervention group or a control group using a 1:1 ratio. Patients in the intervention group will receive the usual care, and their family will get education in diabetes control and the importance of family support by subscribing to the WeChat public account. Both the patients and the family members will be followed up at 12months after the intervention commences. Data collection is scheduled at baseline, 6-months, and 12-months.DiscussionFamily involvement based on WeChat may generate ongoing support for type 2 diabetic patients and improve these patients' health outcomes. A successful outcome of this study may also provide inspiration for other efforts to provide health education via WeChat.Trial registrationChiCTR1900020736. Registered 15 January 2019.

AB BackgroundLeishmaniasis is a parasitic infection endemic in more than ninety countries of the world. The cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a most common form of leishmaniasis and it remains to be a major public health issue in Saudi Arabia. This study was undertaken to investigate the Leishmania species responsible for CL infection in different provinces of Qassim, Saudi Arabia.MethodsSkin biopsies were obtained from CL patients and DNA was extracted using the Magna pure system. Leishmania species were identified by highly specific/sensitive quantitative and qualitative PCR.ResultsOut of total 206 CL biopsies, 49.5% biopsies were found to be positive for Leishmania major (L. major), 28.6% biopsies were positive for Leishmania tropica (L. tropica), 3.9% were found to be positive for Leishmania infantum/donovani (L. infantum/donovani). Not only have these, all tested CL biopsies showed negative test for Leishmania mexicana (L. mexicana) and Leishmania viannia (L. viannia).ConclusionsThis is the first comprehensive study that shows the majority of CL in Qassim was caused by L. major and L. tropica. To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first report that shows the occurrence of L. infantum/donovani in Saudi Arabia. This requires higher alert to the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia to take proactive actions in preventing the onset of L. major, L. tropica, L. infantum and L. donovani infections.

ID SERVICE DELAY; DIAGNOSIS
AB BackgroundTuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem and it is among the top 10 causes of death worldwide. One of the challenges against attaining an effective TB control program is delay in seeking health care to diagnosis and treatment of TB patients. The aim of this study was to assess health care-seeking delay among pulmonary TB patients.MethodsAn institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted amongnew pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients >15years of age who were enrolled in the intensive phase TB treatment from November 1, 2015 - January 30, 2016. Data were collected by an interviewer administered technique using a structured questionnaire. Health care seeking delay was categorized by using a median cutoff point of >30days as a prolonged health care seeking delay. Logistic regression analyses were employed to determine factors independently associated with the delays in health care seeking.ResultsA total of 422 PTB patients were included in this study. The median age of respondents was 37years (interquartile range (IQR) =35-44). The median time of health care seeking delay was 30days (IQR)=21-60). Respondents occupation, knowledge about pulmonary tuberculosis, health facility visited first, seeking treatment from traditional orreligious healers before visiting health facilities, reason for not seeking treatment early from health facilities, and reason for first consultation were found to be significantly associated with health care seeking delay.ConclusionThe study showed the magnitude of health care seeking delay among pulmonary tuberculosis patient was very long and the factors associated with health care seeking delaywere: occupation,knowledge status, health facility visited first and seeking treatment from religious ortraditional healer before health facilities. To overcome delay of health care seeking among tuberculosis patients, efforts should required availing tuberculosis diagnostic and treatment services at the primary health care level.

DT Article
DE Second primary cancer; Carcinoma cuniculatum; Prevention; Mandible
ID TUMORS; HEAD
AB BackgroundWhereas the incidence of cancers increases, overall survival of cancerous patients improves. Preventing the onset of second primary cancer is a new public health challenge and requires a special attention from organ specialists. We report a rare case of carcinoma cuniculatum in a context of metastatic prostate cancer. No case was previously described. Diagnosis delay of carcinoma cuniculatum is frequent and particularly in case of endophytic intra-osseous topography. The aim of this case report is to remind that persistent pain requires medical evaluation to rule out any possibility of second primary cancer.Case presentationA 78-year-old patient followed for a metastatic prostate cancer had been describing neuralgic dental pain in the lower posterior left quadrant for several months. Healing delay of tooth #37 (second left mandibular molar) extraction socket in the painful region led to an intra-alveolar incisional biopsy, which showed a tumor widely invading the mandibular body. Radiologic, histopathologic and clinical elements finally concluded to an intra-osseous carcinoma cuniculatum. Duration of total treatment (oral biopsy to hemimandibulectomy) and follow up were about five months and one year respectively. Patient died before reconstruction.ConclusionThis case recalls that any persistent tooth pain affecting cancer patients requires a thorough review to exclude any secondary primary cancers or any metastasis of the oral cavity and more specifically in jawbones.

   Hypertension is the leading driver of cardiovascular disease deaths in Africa. Its prevalence is highest in older populations. Yet, this group has received little attention in many African countries. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO registration: CRD42017056474) to estimate the prevalence of hypertension in older adults living in Africa.
   Methods
   We searched grey literature and major electronic databases including PubMed and Embase for population-based studies and published between 1 January 1980 to 28 May 2018 reporting the prevalence of hypertension for adults aged >= 50 years living in Africa. We employed a random effects model to estimate the pooled prevalence across included studies.
   Findings
   We screened 10,719 articles and retrieved 103 full-text articles to evaluate for inclusion in the review. Thirty-four unique studies providing 37 data points on 43,025 individuals in 15 African countries were analyzed. The prevalence of hypertension ranged from 22.3% to 90.0% from the individual studies while the overall pooled prevalence was 57.0% (95% CI 52%-61%). The prevalence was not statistically significantly different by sex, residence, or African sub-region. In individual studies, older age and overweight/obesity were independently associated with hypertension. Twenty-nine (78%) data points were deemed to be of low-or moderate-risk of bias. Eliminating high-risk bias studies made little difference to the pooled estimate of hypertension. Sensitivity analyses, omitting one study at a time, identified three studies with significant but relatively small impact on the pooled estimate. We observed substantial heterogeneity (I-2 = 98.9%) across the studies which was further explored by meta-regression analyses. Overall, the GRADE assessment suggested moderate quality evidence in the results.
   Conclusion
   The persistent high prevalence of hypertension among older adults in Africa, even in rural populations warrants more attention to the cardiovascular health of this group by public health authorities.

AB BackgroundHigh quality data are needed for decision-making at all levels of the public health system, from guiding public health activities at the local level, to informing national policy development, to monitoring the impact of global initiatives. Although a number of approaches have been developed to evaluate the underlying quality of routinely collected vaccination administrative data, there remains a lack of consensus around how data quality is best defined or measured.DiscussionWe present a definitional framework that is intended to disentangle many of the elements that have confused discussions of vaccination data quality to date. The framework describes immunization data in terms of three key characteristics: data quality, data usability, and data utilization. The framework also offers concrete suggestions for a specific set of indicators that could be used to better understand immunization those key characteristics, including Trueness, Concurrence, Relevancy, Efficiency, Completeness, Timeliness, Integrity, Consistency, and Utilization.ConclusionBeing deliberate about the choice of indicators; being clear on their definitions, limitations, and methods of measurement; and describing how those indicators work together to give a more comprehensive and practical understanding of immunization data quality, usability, and use, should yield more informed, and therefore better, programmatic decision-making.

AB BackgroundThe current and declining physical activity levels of children is a global concern. Integrating physical activity into the school curriculum may be an effective way not only to improve children's physical activity levels but also enhance educational outcomes. Given the recent national focus in Australia on improving the literacy levels of children in primary school, and an increasing proportion of time spent on explicitly teaching these skills, integrating physical activity into English could be a viable strategy to improve literacy levels and physical activity at the same time. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of the Thinking While Moving in English' (TWM-E) program on children's physical activity, on-task behavior in the classroom, academic achievement, and executive function.MethodsGrade 3-4 children from 10 public schools in New South Wales, Australia will be randomly allocated to intervention (n=5) or control (n=5) groups. All teachers will receive 1-day workshop of registered professional learning and a TWM-E equipment pack (e.g., chalk, lettered bean bags). Intervention schools will be asked to adapt their English lessons to embed movement-based learning in their daily program for three 40-min lessons per week, over a six-week period. The primary outcome is children's physical activity levels across the school day (measured using accelerometry). Secondary outcomes are children's on-task behavior during English lessons, academic achievement in English, and executive function. A detailed process evaluation will be undertaken including questionnaires, fidelity checks, and teacher and student interviews.DiscussionThe TWM-E program has the potential to improve primary school children's physical activity levels, along with academic outcomes (on-task behavior, cognition, and academic achievement), and provide stakeholders with exemplar lessons and guidelines which illustrate how to teach English to children whilst they are moving.Trial registrationAustralian and New Zealand Clinical trial Register ACTRN12618001009202Date registered: 15/06/2018 retrospectively registered.

TI Providers' knowledge on postpartum intrauterine contraceptive device
   (PPIUCD) service provision in Amhara region public health facility,
   Ethiopia
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID EXPERIENCES
AB Introduction
   Postpartum intrauterine contraceptive devices (PP-IUCD) are one type of post-partum family planning method, which can be provided to a post-partum woman starting from the placental delivery time (within 10 minutes), or within the first 48 hours of postpartum period. In most developing countries, delivery time is the primary opportunity for women to access post-partum family planning methods, especially for those living in remote areas. Hence, this study assesses providers' knowledge on postpartum intrauterine contraceptive device service provision.
   Methods
   A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Amhara region health center and hospitals. Health providers surveyed included obstetricians, gynecologists, general practitioners, emergency surgical officers, health officers, midwives and nurses from September 18, 2015 to December18, 2016. Simple random sampling was used to select 864 subjects. Data were collected by using a structured self-administered questionnaire and observing the facility. Multilevel analysis was done to see factors associated with outcome.
   Results
   A total of 197 health facilities and 864 providers are included in the final analysis. Of the total providers 524 (60.6%) were from a health center. The mean age (+/- SD) of participants was 27.8 years (+/- 5.4). The number of providers with good knowledge accounted for 253 of those surveyed (29.3%). The proportion of good knowledge among trained PP-IUCD providers was 35.7% (those who scored above average), and 27.9% was untrained about PP-IUCD. A considerable heterogeneity was observed between health facilities for each indicator of provider's knowledge. Gender differences were observed as the mean knowledge score deference on PP-IUCD by 0.4 points (beta= -0.41; -0.72, -0.10) when the participant was female. Having experience of regular counseling of pregnant women increases PP-IUCD knowledge score by 0.97. (beta= 0.97; 95% CI: 0.48, 1.47). Where the health facility requested clients to purchase the IUCD themselves, the mean knowledge score decreased by 0.47 points compared with free of charge at the facility level (beta = -0.47; 95%CI: -0.87, -0.07).
   Conclusion
   Our findings showed that providers' knowledge about postpartum IUCD was low in the Amhara region public health facility. The lowest knowledge score was noted among nurses, health Officers, midwives, and general practice professionals. Factors associated with providers' knowledge on PP-IUCD are the status of health facility, female sex, training on PP-IUCD, regular counseling of pregnant women, and unavailability of IUCD service.

TI Gains in health insurance coverage explain variation in Democratic vote
   share in the 2008-2016 presidential elections
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CARE; POLITICS; REFORM; POLICY
AB In the last decade, health care reform has dominated U.S. public policy and political discourse. Double-digit rate increases in premiums in the Health Insurance Marketplaces established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2018 make this an ongoing issue that could affect future elections. A seminal event that changed the course of policy and politics around health care reform is the 2016 presidential election. The results of the 2016 presidential election departed considerably from polling forecasts. Given the prominence of the Affordable Care Act in the election, we test whether changes in health insurance coverage at the county-level correlate with changes in party vote share in the presidential elections from 2008 through 2016. We find that a one-percentage-point increase in county health insurance coverage was associated with a 0.25-percentage-point increase in the vote share for the Democratic presidential candidate. We further find that these gains on the part of the Democratic candidate came almost fully at the expense of the Republican (as opposed to third-party) presidential candidates. We also estimate models separately for states that did and did not expand Medicaid and find no differential effect of insurance gains on Democratic vote share for states that expanded Medicaid compared to those that did not. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that outcomes in health insurance markets played a role in the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. The decisions made by the current administration, and how those decisions affect health insurance coverage and costs, may be important factors in future elections as well.

AB Introduction
   Antepartum depression is a contributing factor for adverse maternal and perinatal outcome. The study aimed to assess the antepartum depressive symptoms in selected public health facilities of Nepal.
   Methodology
   This is a mixed-method cross-sectional study that included 143 pregnant women attending the antenatal checkup in four public health facilities of Kathmandu. Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) tool with cut-off score > = 10 was used to assess the antepartum depressive symptoms. Bivariate and multivariable analysis was carried out to identify factors associated with the depressive symptoms. Further semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 pregnant women identified with the depressive symptoms.
   Result
   Of the total 143 pregnant women, 26 (18%, CI at 95% 12.6-25.5) reported depressive symptoms. Multivariable analysis reported higher odds of antepartum depressive-symptoms with health problem, early gestational age, sex preference, and spousal alcohol intake. Thematic analysis of qualitative data further revealed participants' apprehension on; birth outcome, a family expectation of male child, inadequate support from the family/husband and disturbed family environment.
   Conclusion
   Notable proportion of pregnant women were reported with antepartum depressive symptoms. Women's perception on patriarchal values for childbirth was revealed to be important factor for the depressive symptoms. The study draws an attention to a need for screening for antepartum depression into primary health care system. Strengthening ongoing efforts on gender equity could contribute the psychological well-being of pregnant women.

ID GENERAL-PRACTICE; NON-ATTENDANCE; APPOINTMENT; ACCESS
AB Patient no-show is a prevalent problem in health care services leading to inefficient resources allocation and limited access to care. This study aims to develop and validate a patient no-show predictive model based on empirical data. A retrospective study was performed using scheduled appointments between 2011 and 2014 from a Brazilian public primary care setting. Fifty percent of the dataset was randomly assigned to model development, and 50% was assigned to validation. Predictive models were developed using stepwise naive and mixed-effect logistic regression along with the Akaike Information Criteria to select the best model. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to assess the best model performance. Of the 57,586 scheduled appointments in the period, 70.7% (n = 40,740) were evaluated including 5,637 patients. The prevalence of no-show was 13.0% (n = 5,282). The best model presented an AUC of 80.9% (95% CI 80.1-81.7). The most important predictors were previous attendance and same-day appointments. The best model developed from data already available in the scheduling system, had a good performance to predict patient no-show. It is expected the model to be helpful to overbooking decision in the scheduling system. Further investigation is needed to explore the effectiveness of using this model in terms of improving service performance and its impact on quality of care compared to the usual practice.

ID IODINE DEFICIENCY; PREVALENCE
AB Background
   Goiter is a major public health problem in Ethiopia. Even though there were studies done on goiter in Ethiopia, there was little evidence in the eastern part of the country. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of goiter and its associated factors among school-age children in Anchar district of Eastern Ethiopia.
   Methods
   A school based cross-sectional study was conducted from February 13 to 30, 2017. Multistage sampling method was used to select 418 children aged 6-12 years. Data were collected using a questionnaire. Children were examined for the presence or absence of goiter based on the criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO). Salt samples were tested using a rapid test kit. Data were entered to EpiData version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 22.0 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were fitted; Crude Odds Ratio (COR) and Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were computed. Level of significance was determined at p-value less than 0.05.
   Results
   The total goiter prevalence rate was 51.8% (CI: 46.9%, 56.8%). Father's education (AOR = 1.87, CI: 1.06, 3.30), type of salt used (AOR = 2.09, CI: 1.13, 3.88), iodine level of salt (AOR = 2.77, CI: 1.11, 6.89), frequency of milk consumption (AOR = 3.65, CI: 1.63, 8.20), frequency of cabbage consumption (AOR = 7.74, CI: 4.48, 13.39), eating status of eggs (AOR = 3.16, CI: 1.54, 6.50), and eating status of dark green vegetables/fruits (AOR = 2.14, CI: 1.17, 3.93) were factors associated with goiter among school-age children.
   CONCLUSION
   The total goiter prevalence rate was very high. Therefore, the health and education sectors of the study area should work hand in hand to improve the awareness of the community about goiter, iodized salt and iodine rich foods.

AB Background: As older people age, they have different health needs compared to younger people. South African elder care policy places a strong emphasis on ageing in community rather than institutional settings, but the primary healthcare system is not geared to address the health needs of older people living in community settings.
   Methods: This paper presents findings of nine focus groups conducted with community-dwelling older adults in three areas (high, medium and low-income) in Cape Town, South Africa over 2 months in 2017. These discussions addressed primary health services available to older persons, their ability to access these services and their expectations and experiences of care.
   Results: Findings showed that while participants in the high-income area had few challenges accessing quality care or support services, services available in lower-income areas were much less responsive and participants displayed low trust in the healthcare system, feeling that their needs were overlooked. Participants who experienced poor doctor-patient communication often failed to comply with treatment, while those who experienced patient-centered communication, either through the private sector or NGO-public sector partnerships had better perceptions of care.
   Conclusions: Older persons' complex health needs cannot be adequately addressed by a process-driven approach to care. Supporting patient-centered communication and care may help health workers to understand older persons health needs and improve patient understanding, trust and co-operation. This paper suggests the importance of community support services in enhancing health access and developing systems that enable healthcare providers to better understand and respond to older persons' needs in resource-constrained settings.

AB BackgroundAccurate information in provider directories are vital in health care including health information exchange, health benefits exchange, quality reporting, and in the reimbursement and delivery of care. Maintaining provider directory data and keeping it up to date is challenging. The objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to combine disparate resources and acquire accurate information on health providers.MethodsPublically available state licensure lists in Connecticut were obtained along with National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES) public use files. Connecticut licensure lists textual information of each health professional who is licensed to practice within the state. A NLP-based system was developed based on healthcare provider taxonomy code, location, name and address information to identify textual data within the state and federal records. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation were performed, and the recall and precision were calculated.ResultsWe identified nurse midwives, nurse practitioners, and dentists in the State of Connecticut. The recall and precision were 0.95 and 0.93 respectively. Using the system, we were able to accurately acquire 6849 of the 7177 records of health provider directory information.ConclusionsThe authors demonstrated that the NLP- based approach was effective at acquiring health provider information. Furthermore, the NLP-based system can always be applied to update information further reducing processing burdens as data changes.

AB BackgroundOsteoporosis has become an important public health issue. Most of the population, particularly elderly people, are at some degree of risk of osteoporosis-related fractures. Accurate identification and surveillance of patient populations with fractures has a significant impact on reduction of cost of care by preventing future fractures and its corresponding complications.MethodsIn this study, we developed a rule-based natural language processing (NLP) algorithm for identification of twenty skeletal site-specific fractures from radiology reports. The rule-based NLP algorithm was based on regular expressions developed using MedTagger, an NLP tool of the Apache Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) pipeline to facilitate information extraction from clinical narratives. Radiology notes were retrieved from the Mayo Clinic electronic health records data warehouse. We developed rules for identifying each fracture type according to physicians' knowledge and experience, and refined these rules via verification with physicians. This study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) for human subject research.ResultsWe validated the NLP algorithm using the radiology reports of a community-based cohort at Mayo Clinic with the gold standard constructed by medical experts. The micro-averaged results of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and F1-score of the proposed NLP algorithm are 0.930, 1.0, 1.0, 0.941, 0.961, respectively. The F1-score is 1.0 for 8 fractures, and above 0.9 for a total of 17 out of 20 fractures (85%).ConclusionsThe results verified the effectiveness of the proposed rule-based NLP algorithm in automatic identification of osteoporosis-related skeletal site-specific fractures from radiology reports. The NLP algorithm could be utilized to accurately identify the patients with fractures and those who are also at high risk of future fractures due to osteoporosis. Appropriate care interventions to those patients, not only the most at-risk patients but also those with emerging risk, would significantly reduce future fractures.

AB BackgroundA shareable repository of clinical notes is critical for advancing natural language processing (NLP) research, and therefore a goal of many NLP researchers is to create a shareable repository of clinical notes, that has breadth (from multiple institutions) as well as depth (as much individual data as possible).MethodsWe aimed to assess the degree to which individuals would be willing to contribute their health data to such a repository. A compact e-survey probed willingness to share demographic and clinical data categories. Participants were faculty, staff, and students in two geographically diverse major medical centers (Utah and New York). Such a sample could be expected to respond like a typical potential participant from the general public who is given complete and fully informed consent about the pros and cons of participating in a research study.ResultsTwo thousand one hundred forty respondents completed the surveys. 56% of respondents were somewhat/definitely willing to share clinical data with identifiers, while 89% of respondents were somewhat (17%)/definitely willing (72%) to share without identifiers. Results were consistent across gender, age, and education, but there were some differences by geographical region. Individuals were most reluctant (50-74%) sharing mental health, substance abuse, and domestic violence data.ConclusionsWe conclude that a substantial fraction of potential patient participants, once educated about risks and benefits, would be willing to donate de-identified clinical data to a shared research repository. A slight majority even would be willing to share absent de-identification, suggesting that perceptions about data misuse are not a major concern. Such a repository of clinical notes should be invaluable for clinical NLP research and advancement.

AB BackgroundAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) in food-producing animals is a global public health issue. This study investigated AMR and virulence profiles of E. coli isolated from healthy chickens in Vietnam. E. coli were isolated from fecal samples collected in five chicken farms located in the provinces of Hoa Binh, Thai Nguyen and Bac Giang in the North of Vietnam. These isolates were examined by disk diffusion for their AMR, PCR for virulence and AMR genes, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis for relatedness between bla(CMY-2)/bla(CTX-M)-positive isolates, electroporation for transferability of bla(CMY-2) or bla(CTX-M) genes and sequencing for mutations responsible for ciprofloxacin resistance.ResultsUp to 99% of indicator isolates were multidrug resistant. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (3GC) was encoded by both bla(CTX-M) and bla(CMY-2) genes; bla(CTX-M) genes being of genotypes bla(CTX-M-1, -14, -15, -17, -57) and (-87), whereas ciprofloxacin resistance was due to mutations in the gyrA and parC genes. Some isolates originating from farms located in different provinces of Vietnam were found to be closely related, suggesting they may have been disseminated from a same source of contamination. Plasmids may also have played a role in the diffusion of 3GC-resistance as the bla(CMY-2) gene was located on plasmids A/C and I1, and the bla(CTX-M) gene variants were carried by I1, FIB, R and HI1. Plasmids carrying the bla(CMY-2)/bla(CTX-M) genes also co-transferred resistance to other antimicrobials. In addition, isolates potentially capable of infecting humans, of which some produced bla(CMY-2)/bla(CTX-M), were identified in this study.ConclusionsBoth clones and plasmids could be involved in the dissemination of 3GC-resistant E. coli within and between chicken farms in Vietnam. These results demonstrate the necessity to monitor AMR and control antimicrobial use in poultry in Vietnam.

AB Background: Unhealthy eating habits are a major problem among adolescents. The objective of the study was to assess the effect of a free breakfast club intervention on dietary habits among students at vocational schools.
   Methods: The study included students (n=318) from four vocational schools in Denmark. Food frequency questionnaires were used to measure eating habits at baseline, first, and second follow-up, after 7 and 14weeks respectively, in a clustered randomized controlled intervention of four months. The effect of the intervention was evaluated through self-reported frequencies of breakfast intake, intake of whole grain products for breakfast and intake of unhealthy snacking in the morning. The outcome measures were daily breakfast intake (yes/no), daily intake of whole grain for breakfast (yes/no), and unhealthy snacking on school day mornings (yes/no).
   Results: The proportion of students who had breakfast every school day increased significantly in the intervention schools from baseline to the first follow-up compared to the control group (OR: 3.77; P=0.0149). The effect was attenuated at the second follow-up. The intake of whole grain products for breakfast increased significantly more among students in intervention schools compared to students in control schools both at first (OR: 4.13; P=0.0079) and second follow-up (OR: 3.27; P=0.0317). No significant change in unhealthy snacking was found.
   Conclusion: Provision of free breakfast at vocational schools can improve the dietary quality of breakfast and decrease breakfast skipping. However, the sustainability of the intervention is a critical issue that needs to be further studied and addressed.

AB Background: Recent population-based surveys have reported that large majorities of children in France, Europe and in the US are not complying with international physical activity (PA) guidelines. There is, therefore, a need to find programs that will improve children's PA habits from an early age. Theory-based interventions that include school, family, and community involvement have the potential to generate a considerable increase in the PA level of children. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) is one of the most widely tested models of the factors influencing health-related behaviors. The Great Live and Move Challenge (GLMC) is an extended TPB-based intervention designed to promote PA in French primary school children aged 7-11years. The objective of this paper is to describe the protocol of a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the GLMC on the PA level of children.
   Methods: This is a two-year cluster-randomized controlled trial comparing an intervention group to a control group, randomized into clusters (community of communes) and stratified by department (Herault, Gard, Aude) and residential environment (urban, rural). The goal is to recruit 4000 children. The GLMC involves children and their parents, and multiple local grassroots partners, such as school teachers, municipal officials and policy stakeholders. The intervention will be delivered over 3.5months per year for a two-year period. Pre- and post-intervention, children and parents will be asked to fulfill a questionnaire concerning current PA level, TPB variables (i.e., intentions, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control) and other psychosocial variables (e.g., perceptions of activity opportunities). A subsample of 400 children will be proposed to wear an accelerometer (i.e., the Actigraph GT3X+). The primary hypothesis is that the GLMC intervention will increase the proportion of children achieving the World Health Organization's recommended 60 min of moderate to vigorous PA per day by 15%.
   Discussion: This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a multilevel, theory-based PA program and potentially provide valuable information for schools and public health officers looking for innovative PA programs.

AB BackgroundScreening programmes for tuberculosis (TB) among immigrants rarely consider the heterogeneity of risk related to migrants' country of origin. We assess the performance of a large screening programme in asylum seekers by analysing (i) the difference in yield and numbers needed to screen (NNS) by country and WHO-reported TB burden, (ii) the possible impact of screening thresholds on sensitivity, and (iii) the value of WHO-estimated TB burden to improve the prediction accuracy of screening yield.MethodsWe combined individual data of 119,037 asylum seekers screened for TB in Germany (2002-2015) with TB estimates of the World Health Organization (WHO) (1990-2014) for their 81 countries of origin. Adjusted rate ratios (aRR) and 95% credible intervals (CrI) of the observed yield of screening were calculated in Bayesian Poisson regression models by categories of WHO-estimated TB incidence. We assessed changes in sensitivity depending on screening thresholds, used WHO TB estimates as prior information to predict TB in asylum seekers, and modelled country-specific probabilities of numbers needed to screen (NNS) conditional on different screening thresholds.ResultsThe overall yield was 82 per 100,000 and the annual yield ranged from 44.1 to 279.7 per 100,000. Country-specific yields ranged from 10 (95%- CrI: 1-47) to 683 (95%-CrI: 306-1336) per 100,000 in Iraqi and Somali asylum seekers, respectively. The observed yield was higher in asylum seekers from countries with a WHO-estimated TB incidence >50 relative to those from countries 50 per 100,000 (aRR: 4.17, 95%-CrI: 2.86-6.59). Introducing a threshold in the range of a WHO-estimated TB incidence of 50 and 100 per 100,000 resulted in the lowest loss in sensitivity. WHO's TB prevalence estimates improved prediction accuracy for eight of the 11 countries, and allowed modelling country-specific probabilities of NNS.ConclusionsWHO's TB data can inform the estimation of screening yield and thus be used to improve screening efficiency in asylum seekers. This may help to develop more targeted screening strategies by reducing uncertainty in estimates of expected country-specific yield, and identify thresholds with lowest loss in sensitivity. Further modelling studies are needed which combine clinical, diagnostic and country-specific parameters.

AB Background: Despite being preventable, anaemia is a major public health problem that affects a sizable number of children under-five years globally and in Tanzania. This study examined the maternal factors associated with the risk of anaemia among under-five children in Tanzania. We also assessed whether higher maternal education could reduce the risks of anaemia among children of women with poor socio-economic status.
   Methods: Data was drawn from the 2015-16 Tanzania demographic and health survey and malaria indicator survey for 7916 children under five years. Adjusted odds ratios were estimated by fitting a proportional odds model to examine the maternal risk factors of anaemia. Stratified analysis was done to examine how the relationship differed across maternal educational levels.
   Results: The findings revealed that maternal disadvantage evident in young motherhood [AOR:1.43, 95%CI:1.16-1.75], no formal education [AOR:1.53, 95%CI:1.25-1.89], unemployment [AOR:1.31, 95%CI:1.15-1.49], poorest household wealth [AOR:1.50, 95%CI:1.17-1.91], and non-access to health insurance [AOR:1.26, 95%CI: 1.03-1.53] were risk factors of anaemia among children in the sample. Sub-group analysis by maternal education showed that the risks were not evident when the mother has secondary or higher education. However, having an unmarried mother was associated with about four-times higher risk of anaemia if the mother is uneducated [AOR:4.04, 95%CI:1.98-8.24] compared with if the mother is currently in union.
   Conclusion: Findings from this study show that a secondary or higher maternal education may help reduce the socio-economic risk factors of anaemia among children under-5 years in Tanzania.

AB Background: Disruptive Behavioral Disorders (DBDs) and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)are chronic, impairing, and costly child and adolescent mental health challenges which, when untreated, can result in disruptions in school performance, friendships and family relations. Yet, there is dearth of prevalence data on child and adolescent behavioral challenges within sub-Saharan Africa, including Uganda. This study aims to estimate the prevalence rate of behavioral challenges and ADHDamong young school going children and early adolescents (ages 8-13 at study enrollment), utilizing a school-based sample in southwest Uganda.
   Methods: We present screening results from a 5-year scale-up study titledSMART Africa-Uganda (2016-2021), set across 30 public primary schools located in the greater Masaka region in Uganda, a region heavily impacted by poverty and HIV/AIDS. Specifically, we draw on screening data from caregivers of 2434 children that used well-established standardized measures that had been pre-tested in the region. These were: 1) oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD) subscales of the Disruptive Behavior Disorders (DBD) scale; and 2) the Iowa Connors and Impairment scales. Slightly over half of the children in the sample were female (52%), with a mean age of 10.27 years.
   Results: Of the 2434 participants screened for disruptive behaviors: 1) 6% (n=136) scored positive on ODD and 2% (n=42) scored positive on CD subscales of the DBD scale; 2) 9.61% (n=234), and 2.67% (n=65) were reported to have elevated symptoms of ODD and ADHD on the Iowa Connors caregiver report scale respectively. Twenty-five percent (n=586) of children were described by their caregivers as having experienced some form of impairment in at least four domains of the Impairment scale.
   Conclusion: The results indicate the presence of behavioral challenges and ADHDamong school going children, aged 8-13years, in Uganda. Given the negative outcomes associated with behavioral challenges as children transition to adolescence and adulthood, detecting these emerging behavioral challenges early is critical in developing appropriate interventions. School settings could be considered as one of the contextually-relevant, culturally-appropriate, and non-stigmatizing venues to implement screening procedures and to detect emerging behavioral challenges and to make necessary referrals.

AB Background
   Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are amongst the leading public health concerns in Pakistan with a high disease burden. Despite the availability of effective antiviral treatments in the country the disease burden in general population has not lowered. This could be attributed to the asymptomatic nature of this infection that results in lack of diagnosis until the late symptomatic stage. To better estimate and map HCV infections in the country a population based analysis is necessary for an effective control of the infection.
   Methods
   Serologic samples of similar to 66,000 participants from all major cities of the Punjab province were tested for anti-HCV antibodies. The antibody-based seroprevalence was associated with socio-demographic variables including geographical region, age, gender and sex, and occupation.
   Results
   Overall serological response to HCV surface antigens was observed in over 17% of the population. Two of the districts were identified with significantly high prevalence in general population. Analysis by occupation showed significantly high prevalence in farmers (over 40%) followed by jobless and retired individuals, laborers and transporters. A significant difference in seroprevalence was observed in different age groups amongst sex and genders (male, female and transgender) with highest response in individuals of over 40 years of age. Moreover, most of the tested IDUs showed positive response for anti-HCV antibody.
   Conclusion
   This study represents a retrospective analysis of HCV infections in general population of the most populated province of Pakistan to identify socio-demographic groups at higher risk. Two geographical regions, Faisalabad and Okara districts, and an occupational group, farmers, were identified with significantly high HCV seroprevalence. These socio-demo- graphic groups are the potential focused groups for follow-up studies on factors contributing to the high HCV prevalence in these groups towards orchestrating effective prevention, control-and treatment.

AB Background
   Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide, particularly in obese and type 2 diabetic individuals. NAFLD ranges in severity from benign steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); and NASH can progress to cirrhosis, primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver failure. As such, NAFLD has emerged as a major public health concern. Herein, we used a lipidomic and transcriptomic approach to identify lipid markers associated with western diet (WD) induced NASH in female mice.

   Female mice (low-density lipoprotein receptor null (LdIr(-/-)) were fed a reference or WD diet for 38 and 46 weeks. Transcriptomic and lipidomic approaches, coupled with statistical analyses, were used to identify associations between major NASH markers and transcriptomic & lipidomic markers.
   Results
   The WD induced all major hallmarks of NASH in female Ldlr(-/-)r mice, including steatosis (SFA, MUFA, MUFA-containing di- and triacylglycerols), inflammation (TNF alpha), oxidative stress (Ncf2), and fibrosis (Coll A). The WD also increased transcripts associated with membrane remodeling (LpCat), apoptosis & autophagy (Caspl, CtsS), hedgehog (Taz) & notch signaling (Hey1), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (S1004A) and cancer (Gpc3). WD feeding, however, suppressed the expression of the hedgehog inhibitory protein (Hhip), and enzymes involved in triglyceride catabolism (Tgh/Ces3, Ces1 g), as well as the hepatic abundance of C18-22 PUFA-containing phosphoglycerolipids (GpCho, GpEtn, GpSer, Gpins). WD feeding also increased hepatic cyclooxygenase (Cox1 & 2) expression and pro-inflammatory omega 6 PUFA-derived oxylipins (PGE2), as well as lipid markers of oxidative stress 8-iso-PGF2 alpha). The WD suppressed the hepatic abundance of reparative oxylipins (19, 20-DiHDPA) as well as the expression of enzymes involved in fatty epoxide metabolism (Cyp2C, Ephx).
   Conclusion
   WD-induced NASH in female LdIr(-/-) mice was characterized by a massive increase in hepatic neutral and membrane lipids containing SFA and MUFA and a loss of C18-22 PUFA-containing membrane lipids. Moreover, the WD increased hepatic pro-inflammatory oxylipins and suppressed the hepatic abundance of reparative oxylipins. Such global changes in the type and abundance of hepatic lipids likely contributes to tissue remodeling and NASH severity.

TI Reaching the unreached: Performance of an enhanced peer outreach
   approach to identify new HIV cases among female sex workers and men who
   have sex with men in HIV programs in West and Central Africa
SO PLOS ONE

ID SOCIAL NETWORKS; DRIVEN; INFECTION; BURDEN; MSM
AB Finding new HIV-positive cases remains a priority to achieve the UNAIDS goals. An enhanced peer outreach approach (EPOA) was implemented to expand the delivery of HIV services to female sex workers (FSWs) and men who have sex with men (MSM) in three countries in West and Central Africa. The aim of EPOA is to identify new HIV-positive cases. EPOA was implemented in Burundi among FSWs, and in Cote d'Ivoire and Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) among both FSWs and MSM. Implementation ranged from five to nine weeks and was nested within a three-month reporting period. Standard outreach was suspended for the duration of EPOA implementation but was resumed thereafter. Summary service statistics were used to compare HIV seropositivity during standard outreach and EPOA. Trends were analyzed during the quarter in which EPOA was implemented, and these were compared with the two preceding quarters. Differences in proportions of HIV seropositivity were tested using Pearson's chi-square test; p-values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Overall, EPOA resulted in a higher proportion of new HIV-positive cases being found, both within and between quarters. In Burundi, HIV seropositivity among FSWs was significantly higher during EPOA than during standard outreach (10.8% vs. 4.1%, p<0.001). In Cote d'Ivoire, HIV seropositivity was significantly higher during EPOA among both populations (FSWs: 5.6% vs. 1.81%, p<0.01; MSM: 15.4% vs. 5.9%; p<0.01). In DRC, HIV seropositivity was significantly higher during EPOA among MSM (6.9% vs. 1.6%; p<0.001), but not among FSWs (5.2% vs. 4.3%; p = 0.08). Trends in HIV seropositivity during routine outreach for both populations were constant during three successive quarters but increased with the introduction of EPOA. EPOA is a public health approach with great potential for reaching new populations and ensuring that they are aware of their HIV status.

AB Background: Vitamin D deficiency is a growing public health problem, with pregnant women beingparticularly vulnerable due to its influences on maternal and neonatal outcomes. However, there arelimited data published about mediators of vitamin D status in Louisiana women. We aimed to assess the vitamin D status and its determinants among low-income pregnant and non-pregnant reproductive-aged women from southeast Louisiana.
   Methods: This study was conducted using data from the Gulf Resilience on Women's Health (GROWH) research consortium cohort of pregnant and non-pregnant women which contained sociodemographic and dietary variables as well as blood and salivary element concentrations. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 86 pregnant and 98 non-pregnant women with an even distribution of race in both groups.
   Results: The prevalence of deficient vitamin D levels in the total cohort (184 women) was 67% and the mean 25(OH) vitamin D-3 was 24.1 ng/mL (SD 10.7). Self-identifying as White, being pregnant, autumn season, young age and high exposure to tobacco smoke measured by cotinine were significantly associated with higher serum levels of vitamin D. Visiting Women and Infant clinics (WIC) was an important determinant in improving 25(OH) vitamin D-3 levels for Black women but not for White women and concentrations varied more among Black women across seasons compared to White women.
   Conclusions: Serum vitamin D levels are inadequate among a high proportion of Black and White low-income pregnant and reproductive-aged women living in Southeast Louisiana who were enrolled in the GROWH study. Black women who are over 35 years old and non-WIC participants constitute the subpopulation most at risk for vitamin D deficiency, especially during the winter. As an overall higher level of deficiency exists in Black women, if even small behavioral and dietary modifications are produced by WIC, this can lead to a comparatively greater improvement in vitamin D status in women from Southeast Louisiana who self-identify as Black.

AB BackgroundThyroid cancer is the most frequent endocrine neoplasia worldwide. Information from Andean countries is scarce. In Ecuador there is no reports available of the epidemiology of this type of cancer. The aim of this study is to present the epidemiology and the burden of disease of thyroid cancer.MethodsThis is a cross-sectional population-based analysis of thyroid cancer epidemiology in Ecuador from 2001 to 2016. The variables studied were the overall mortality rate, socio-demographics characteristics of the hospitalized patients, geographical trends and the burden of thyroid cancer in Ecuador. All the data was obtained from the official records reported by the Ministry of Public Health's and retrieved from the public databases of the Vital Statistics Deaths and Births Databases and the National Institute of Census and Statistics (INEC).ResultsIn Ecuador, over a period of 16years from 2001 to 2016 a total of 23,632 hospital admissions were reported, which caused 1539 deaths due thyroid cancer. Data demonstrated an annual mean of 1477 cases, which caused 96 deaths per year in average. The annual incidence fluctuated from 3 in 2001 to 22 in 2016 per 100,000 inhabitants. Women were 5 times more likely than men to have thyroid cancer. The average length of stay for both sexes were 4days. The mortality attributable to thyroid cancer represent less than 0.3% of all cancer deaths.ConclusionEcuador has one of the highest rates of thyroid cancer in Latin America, ranking first among women in Latin America. Although this cancer is frequent, mortality rate is relatively low. As this is the first national report of thyroid cancer in the country, a further analysis of the pathological variants and the grading of this neoplasia is needed.

AB BackgroundThe Family Nurse Partnership (FNP) programme was introduced to support young first-time mothers. A randomised trial found FNP added little short-term benefit compared to usual care. The study included a comprehensive parallel process evaluation, including focus groups, conducted to aid understanding of the introduction of the programme into a new service and social context. The aim of the focus groups was to investigate views of key health professionals towards the integration and delivery of FNP programme in England.MethodsFocus groups were conducted separately with Family Nurses, Health Visitors and Midwives at trial sites during 2011-2012. Transcripts from audio-recordings were analysed thematically.ResultsA total of 122 professionals participated in one of 19 focus groups. Family Nurses were confident in the effectiveness of FNP, although they experienced practical difficulties meeting programme fidelity targets and considered that programme goals did not sufficiently reflect client or community priorities. Health Visitors and Midwives regarded FNP as well-resourced and beneficial to clients, describing their own services as undervalued and struggling. They wished to work closely with Family Nurses, but felt excluded from doing so by practical barriers and programme protection.ConclusionFNP was described as well-resourced and delivered by highly motivated and well supported Family Nurses. FNP eligibility, content and outcomes conflicted with individual client and community priorities. These factors may have restricted the potential effectiveness of a programme developed and previously tested in a different social milieu. Building Blocks ISRCTN23019866 Registered 20/04/2009.

AB Background: Running has become one of the most popular sports and has proven benefits for public health. Policy makers are increasingly aware that attractively designed public spaces may promote running. However, little is known about what makes a running environment attractive and restorative for runners and to what extent this depends on characteristics of the runner. This study aims to investigate 1) to what extent intrapersonal characteristics (i.e. motives and attitudes) and perceived environmental characteristics (e.g. quality of the running surface, greenness of the route, feelings of safety and hinderance by other road users) are associated with the perceived attractiveness and restorative capacity of the running environment and 2) to what extent the number of years of running experience modify these associations.
   Methods: Cross-sectional data were collected through the online Eindhoven Running Survey 2015 (ERS15) among half marathon runners (N=2477; response rate 26.6%). Linear regression analyses were performed for two outcomes separately (i.e. perceived attractiveness and perceived restorative capacity of the running environment) to investigate their relations with motives and attitudes, perceived environmental characteristics and interactions between perceived environmental characteristics and number of years of running experience.
   Results: Perceived environmental characteristics, including green and lively routes and a comfortable running surface were more important for runners' evaluation of the attractiveness and restorative capacity of the running environment than runners' motives and attitudes. In contrast to experienced runners, perceived hinder from unleashed dogs and pedestrians positively impacted the attractiveness and restorative capacity for less experienced runners.
   Conclusions: Perceived environmental characteristics were important determinants of the attractiveness and restorative capacity of the running environment for both novice and experienced runners. However, green and lively elements in the running environment and hinderances by cars were more important for less experienced runners. In order to keep novice runners involved in running it is recommended to design comfortable running tracks and routes and provide good access to attractive, green and lively spaces.

AB Background: Increasing physical activity in older adults remains a key public health priority in countries with a high burden of non-communicable disease, yet current interventions have failed to substantially increase population uptake with UK data suggesting that only half of 65-74year olds report meeting recommended levels. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic and inductive qualitative synthesis of the large body of qualitative research describing what influences physical activity at this age, and older adults' experiences of physical activity.
   Methods: A qualitative meta-ethnography was chosen as the study design as this inductive approach can provide novel insights and generate new theory about physical activity and ageing. Papers were identified by searching electronic databases and key citations. Peer-reviewed primary qualitative studies and systematic reviews were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: community-dwelling participants aged 60years or older or in the retirement transition period; reporting on leisure-time physical activity; utilising a rigorous qualitative methodology. A line of argument approach was employed to generate a theory about how older adults think and feel about physical activity.
   Results: Thirty-nine papers met the inclusion criteria and were synthesised. The emergent theory suggested transition to older age can challenge people's sense of self and their role in life. Physical activity can help in regaining feelings of purpose, of being needed in collective group activity, and by creating habitual routine and structure to the day. In overcoming real and perceived barriers, and by taking up or sustaining physical activities, older adults can further build self-esteem all of which contributes to a fulfilling older age.
   Conclusion: Current failures to increase population levels of physical activity in older adults may be explained by an approach overly focused on the health benefits of activity. Insights from this study suggest we need to reframe our approach to consider the wider set of goals and aspirations which are of greater personal importance to older adults, and future interventions should focus on how physical activity can contribute to life satisfaction, sense of purpose, and sense of role fulfilment in older age.

TI Revitalization of integrated disease surveillance and response in Sierra
   Leone post Ebola virus disease outbreak

ID PUBLIC-HEALTH SURVEILLANCE; IMPLEMENTATION; SYSTEM
AB Background: The Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS) in Sierra Leone partially rolled out the implementation of Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) in 2003. After the Ebola virus disease outbreak in 2014-2015, there was need to strengthen IDSR to ensure prompt detection and response to epidemic-prone diseases. We describe the processes, successes and challenges of revitalizing public health surveillance in a country recovering from a protracted Ebola virus disease outbreak.
   Methods: The revitalization process began with adaptation of the revised IDSR guidelines and development of customized guidelines to suit the health care systems in Sierra Leone. Public health experts defined data flow, system operations, case definitions, frequency and channels of reporting and dissemination. Next, phased training of IDSR focal persons in each health facility and the distribution of data collection and reporting tools was done. Monitoring activities included periodic supportive supervision and data quality assessments. Rapid response teams were formed to investigate and respond to disease outbreak alerts in all districts.
   Results: Submission of reports through the IDSR system began in mid-2015 and by the 35th epidemiologic week, all district health teams were submitting reports. The key performance indicators measuring the functionality of the IDSR system in 2016 and 2017 were achieved (WHO Africa Region target 80%); the annual average proportion of timely weekly health facility reports submitted to the next level was 93% in 2016 and 97% in 2017; the proportion of suspected outbreaks and public health events detected through the IDSR system was 96% (n=87) in 2016 and 100% (n=85) in 2017.
   Conclusion: With proper planning, phased implementation and adequate investment of resources, it is possible to establish a functional IDSR system in a country recovering from a public health crisis. A functional IDSR system requires well trained workforce, provision of the necessary tools and guidelines, information, communication and technology infrastructure to support data transmission, provision of timely feedback as well as logistical support.

AB BackgroundThe public primary healthcare system in Greece has not been fully developed and is delivered by urban and rural health centers, outpatient departments in public hospitals and the recently established first-contact and decentralized local primary care units. The aim of this study was to develop a valid and reliable measurement tool for conducting periodic user experience evaluation surveys in public Primary HealthCare facilities in Greece such as outpatient clinics of public hospitals and health centers.MethodsA mixed methods approach was applied. In particular, the methodology of developing and validating the tools included three steps: (a) establishment of the theoretical background/literature review, (b) qualitative study: development of the tools items and establishment of the face validity and (c) quantitative study: pilot testing and establishment of the structural validity and estimation of the internal consistency of the tools. Two patient focus groups participated in qualitative study: one visiting health centres and the other visiting the outpatient clinics of public hospitals. Quantitative study included 733 Primary Health Care services' users/patients and was conducted during August-October 2017. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis was performed to check for structural validity of the tools, while Cronbach's alpha coefficients were estimated to check for reliability.ResultsConfirmatory factor analysis confirmed almost perfectly the presumed theoretical model and the following six factors were identified through the tools: (a) accessibility (three items, e.g. opening hours), (b) continuity and coordination of care (three items, e.g. doctor asks for medical history), (c) comprehensiveness of care (three items, e.g. doctor provides advices for healthy life), (d) quality of medical care (four items, e.g. sufficient examination time), (e) facility (four items, e.g. comfortable waiting room) and (f) quality of care provided by nurses and other health professionals (four items, e.g. polite nurses).ConclusionsWe have developed reliable and valid tools to measure users' experiences in public Primary HealthCare facilities in Greece. These tools could be very useful in examining differences between different types of public Primary Health Care facilities and different populations.

AB BackgroundDengue infections have become a huge threat to public health systems in developing countries. Data on seroprevalence and incidence of dengue infections are lacking from rural regions of India. The objective of present study was to investigate the seroprevalence and incidence of dengue infection utilizing repeated serosurveys from a rural region of Maharashtra, Western India.MethodsIn the present study, 819 children between ages 5 to 15years from 21 villages in Pune District of Maharashtra, India were sampled in 2014 and 2016. The sera were tested for the presence of dengue specific IgG using an indirect IgG ELISA kit.ResultsOverall seroprevalence of dengue was 15.3% (95% confidence intervals (CI) 12.9-17.8%) in 2014 and 20.5% (95% CI 17.8-23.4%) in 2016. Among the 694 children who were seronegative at baseline (2014), 78 seroconverted. Overall incidence rate of primary dengue was 54.2 infections/1000 children years (95% CI 43.0-67.3). Incidence of primary dengue infection was higher in children from urbanized villages compared to rural villages (Incidence rate ratio (IRR) 2.6 (95% CI 1.3-5.2)). In rural villages, incidence of primary dengue infection was higher in children aged 10years or above as compared to those aged below 10years (IRR 9.75 (95% CI 1.21-77.9).ConclusionsThe study provides the incidence rates of primary dengue infections from a rural region of India. More multi centric studies investigating the incidence of dengue will provide accurate estimate of incidence of dengue and help formulate well directed policies. The results also suggest that urbanization and transitions in demographic settings might favour dengue outbreaks in rural regions and these regions need to be targeted for vector control measures.

AB BackgroundThe bacterial genus Bartonella is distributed worldwide and poses a public health risk. Cat-scratch disease caused by B. henselae in Croatia was first described in 1957. It is present throughout the country: a survey of serum samples from 268 Croatian patients with lymphadenopathy showed that 37.7% had IgG antibodies. Despite this prevalence, we are unaware of reports of Bartonella culturing from infected humans or cats in Croatia or elsewhere in southeast Europe.Case presentationHere we describe the diagnosis of a 12-year-old child with lymphadenopathy in Croatia with cat-scratch disease based on antibody detection and clinical signs, and the subsequent culturing and genotyping of B.henselae from the cat's blood. The B. henselae isolate was grown on different blood agar plates and its identity was confirmed based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (16S rDNA) and sequencing. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) identified the strain genotype as sequence type 5, commonly found zoonotic B. henselae strain in cats. The child recovered after azithromycin therapy, and B. henselae in the cat was eliminated within three months after doxycycline treatment.ConclusionsThis is, to our knowledge, the first report of B. henselae culturing and MLST-based genotyping from cat's blood in southeast Europe. Our ability to detect B. henselae in blood through culturing but not PCR suggests that the prevalence of infected cats with low bacteremia is very high, suggesting the need to develop faster, more sensitive detection assays.

TI Burden of household food insecurity in urban slum settings
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID PREVALENCE; PREDICTORS; WOMEN; CARE
AB This study examined the burden of food insecurity in India's un-notified slums, using an SDG framework to identify correlates of food insecurity. A convenience sampling approach was employed in selecting 38 slums from 675 un-notified slums across four geographic zones. Ten percent of the households in each slum site were selected from each zone, and one household member was interviewed, based on their availability and fulfilment of the eligibility criteria. Eligible individuals included those aged 18 years and above, who were resident in the selected slums and provided consent. Individuals with mental or physical challenges were excluded. A total sample of 907 study participants were included. Results showed that 43% (n = 393) of the participants were food insecure. More than half were females (73%, n = 285), who had not completed any schooling (51%, n = 202). One-third (n = 128) resided in the Northern Region of Delhi. SDG-related predictors of food insecurity included: household educational level (SDG 4 Quality education) (p = 0.03), coverage of health service needs (SDG 3 Good health and well-being) (p = 0.0002), electricity needs (SDG 7 affordable and clean energy) (p<0.0001), and employment needs (SDG 8 Decent and economic growth) (p = 0.003). Having healthcare needs that were partially or fully met was equally associated with higher food insecurity: this could be attributed to high healthcare costs and the lack of federal subsidies in un-notified slums, collectively contributing to high out-of-pocket health costs. Failure to fully meet employment needs was also significantly associated with higher food insecurity. However, met needs for electricity, finance, women's safety and satisfactory family relationships, were associated with lower food insecurity. Household predictors of food insecurity included: number of household members, and the presence of physically disabled household members. Necessary interventions should include connecting food insecure households to existing social services such as India's Public Distribution System, and multi-sector partnerships to address the existing challenges.

ID RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; CONTACT; PREVALENCE; REGION
AB Background
   Tuberculosis remains a major public-health problem in the world, despite several efforts to improve case identification and treatment compliance. It is well known cause of ill-health among millions of people each year and ranks as the second leading cause of death from infectious disease worldwide. Despite implementation of the World health organization recommended strategy, the reductions in the incidence of TB have been minimal in high burden countries.
   Objectives and methods
   A case control study was carried out to assess the risk factors of TB, where cases were newly registered bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB patients with age greater than 15 years who present at twenty health centres in Addis Ababa. Controls were age and sex matched attendees who presented in the same health centers for non-TB health problems.
   Results
   A total of 260 cases and 260 controls were enrolled in the study and 45.8% of cases and 46.2% of controls were in the 26-45 years age bracket. According to the multivariable logistic regression analysis, seven variables were found to be independent predictors for the occurrence of TB after controlling possible confounders. Patients who live in house with no window or one window were almost two times more likely to develop tuberculosis compared to people whose house has multiple windows (AOR = 1.81; 95% CI: 1.06, 3.07). Previous history of hospital admission was found to pose risk almost more than three times (AOR = 3.39; 95% CI: 1.64-7.03). Having a household member who had TB was shown to increase risk of developing TB by three fold (AOR = 3.00; 95% CI: 1.60, 5.62). The study showed that illiterate TB patients were found to be more than twice more likely to develop TB compared to subjects who can atleast read and write (AOR, 95% CI = 2.15, 1.05, 4.40). Patients with household income of less than 1000 birrs per month were more than two times more likely to develop TB compared to those who had higher income (AOR = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.28, 3.78). Smoking has also been identified as important risk factor for developing TB by four times (AOR = 4.43; 95% CI: 2.10, 9.3). BCG was found to be protective against TB reducing the risk by one-third (AOR = 0.34; 95% CI: 0.22, 0.54).
   Conclusion
   This study showed that TB is more common among the most agile and economically active age group, and number of windows, history of hospital admission, a household member who had TB, illiteracy, low household income and smoking and lack of BCG scar were identified as independent risk factors. Therefore it is imperative that the TB control effort need a strategy to address socio economic issues such as poverty, overcrowding, smoking, and infection control at health care facilities level is an important intervention to prevent transmission of TB within the facilities.

   Author summary As a species, we know as much about teaching and learning as we do about public health, but most people who teach at the postsecondary level are never introduced to even the basics of evidence-based pedagogy. Knowing just a few key facts will help you build more effective lessons in less time and with less pain and will also make those lessons easier for your peers to find and reuse. This paper presents 10 tips that you can apply immediately and explains why they work.

AB Klebsiella pneumoniae has emerged as an important cause of two distinct public health threats: multi-drug resistant (MDR) healthcare-associated infections and drug susceptible community-acquired invasive infections. These pathotypes are generally associated with two distinct subsets of K. pneumoniae lineages or clones' that are distinguished by the presence of acquired resistance genes and several key virulence loci. Genomic evolutionary analyses of the most notorious MDR and invasive community-associated (hypervirulent') clones indicate differences in terms of chromosomal recombination dynamics and capsule polysaccharide diversity, but it remains unclear if these differences represent generalised trends. Here we leverage a collection of >2200 K. pneumoniae genomes to identify 28 common clones (n 10 genomes each), and perform the first genomic evolutionary comparison. Eight MDR and 6 hypervirulent clones were identified on the basis of acquired resistance and virulence gene prevalence. Chromosomal recombination, surface polysaccharide locus diversity, pan-genome, plasmid and phage dynamics were characterised and compared. The data showed that MDR clones were highly diverse, with frequent chromosomal recombination generating extensive surface polysaccharide locus diversity. Additional pan-genome diversity was driven by frequent acquisition/loss of both plasmids and phage. In contrast, chromosomal recombination was rare in the hypervirulent clones, which also showed a significant reduction in pan-genome diversity, largely driven by a reduction in plasmid diversity. Hence the data indicate that hypervirulent clones may be subject to some sort of constraint for horizontal gene transfer that does not apply to the MDR clones. Our findings are relevant for understanding the risk of emergence of individual K. pneumoniae strains carrying both virulence and acquired resistance genes, which have been increasingly reported and cause highly virulent infections that are extremely difficult to treat. Specifically, our data indicate that MDR clones pose the greatest risk, because they are more likely to acquire virulence genes than hypervirulent clones are to acquire resistance genes.
   Author summary Klebsiellla pneumoniae is classified by the World Health Organization as a priority drug-resistant organism because it causes a significant burden of hospital infections that are extremely difficult to treat. However, outside of the hospital setting this bacterium is also an important cause of severe drug-susceptible infections. Until recently these two infection types were associated with distinct subsets of the K. pneumoniae population harbouring high prevalence of drug-resistance and virulence genes, respectively. However, there are now increasing reports of highly-virulent and difficult-to-treat K. pneumoniae strains that carry both resistance and virulence genes. In this study, we used genomic analyses to characterise and compare the evolutionary histories of drug-resistant and virulent K. pneumoniae. We show that the former are highly diverse, frequently acquiring novel genes through the processes of chromosomal recombination, plasmid and bacteriophage acquisition. In comparison, the latter show considerably lower gene content diversity, suggesting that they may be subject to some sort of limitation for gene acquisition. Consequently, we predict that drug-resistant K. pneumoniae are more likely to acquire virulence genes than virulent K. pneumoniae are to acquire drug-resistance genes.

TI The gendered impact of Buruli ulcer on the household production of
   health and social support networks: Why decentralization favors women

AB Background Buruli ulcer [BU] is a chronic and debilitating neglected tropical skin disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. The treatment of moderate to severe BU affects the well-being of entire households and places a strain on both gender relations within households and social relations with kin asked for various types of support. In this paper, we employ the conceptual lenses provided by the Household Production of Health approach to understanding the impact of illness on the household as a unit of analysis, gender studies, and social support related research to better understand BU health care decision making and the psychosocial experience of BU hospitalization.
   Methods An ethnography attentive to circumstance and the nested contexts within which stakeholders respond to BU was conducted employing semi-structured interviews, illness narratives, and case studies. An iterative process of data collection with preliminary analyses and reflection shaped subsequent interviews. Interviews were conducted with 45 women in households having a member afflicted with BU in two communes of Benin with high prevalence rates for BU. The first commune [ZE] has a well-established decentralized BU treatment program and a well-functioning referral network linked to the Allada reference hospital specializing in the care of BU and other chronic ulcers. The second commune [Ouinhi] is one of the last regions of the country to introduce a decentralized BU treatment program. A maximum variation purposeful sample was selected to identify information-rich health care decision cases for in-depth study.
   Principal findings Study results demonstrated that although men are the primary decision makers for healthcare decisions outside the home, women are largely responsible for arranging care for the afflicted in hospital in addition to managing their own households. A woman's agency and ability to influence the decision-making process is largely based on whatever social support and substitute labor she can mobilize from her own network of kin relations. When support wanes, women are placed in a vulnerable position and often end up destitute. Decentralized BU treatment is preferred because it enables a woman to remain in her own household as a patient or caretaker of an ill family member while engaging in child care and petty revenue earing activities. Remaining in the hospital (a liminal space) as either patient or caretaker also renders a woman vulnerable to rumor and innuendo about sexual liaisons and constitutes a form of social risk. Social risk in some cases eclipses the physical risk of the disease in what we would describe as a hierarchy of risks.
   Conclusion This study illustrates the importance of decentralized treatment programs for NTDs such as BU. Such programs enable patients to remain in their homes while being treated, and do not displace women responsible for the welfare of the entire household. When women are displaced the well-being of the entire household is placed in jeopardy.
   Author summary In this gender-focused study of the neglected tropical disease Buruli ulcer (BU) in Benin, West Africa, we document how seeking care for BU is influenced by broad-based concerns about the household production of health and the availability of resources women can mobilize from their social support networks. Women and girls shoulder a disproportionate share of the burdens incurred by BU treatment and prefer decentralized treatment from local health stations to free hospital care. Long term and often-indeterminate residence in hospital threatens the integrity of households and results in marital stress, economic vulnerability, school and vocational training dropout, and loss of essential income-generating activities. The case study of BU clearly demonstrates the necessity of recognizing the household, and not just the patient, as a unit of analysis in public health and the need to consider the ripple effect of serious illness beyond the household to one's social network. We draw attention to the fact that while men are the decision makers about health care in patrilineal Beninese society, a women's agency in influencing decision making is tied to her accumulation of social capital, capital that is taxed by long term medical treatment weakening her safety net in the future.

AB Background Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a serious disease with a high fatality rate reported in many countries. The first case of CCHF in Oman was detected in 1995 and serosurveys have suggested widespread infection of humans and livestock throughout the country.
   Methodology Cases of CCHF reported to the Ministry of Health (MoH) of Oman between 1995 and 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Diagnosis was confirmed by serology and/or molecular tests in Oman. Stored RNA from recent cases was studied by sequencing the complete open reading frame (ORF) of the viral S segment at Public Health England, enabling phylogenetic comparisons to be made with other S segments of strains obtained from the region.
   Findings Of 88 cases of CCHF, 4 were sporadic in 1995 and 1996, then none were detected until 2011. From 2011-2017, incidence has steadily increased and 19 (23.8%) of 80 cases clustered around Eid Al Adha. The median (range) age was 33 (15-68) years and 79 (90%) were male. The major risk for infection was contact with animals and/or butchering in 73/88 (83%) and only one case was related to tick bites alone. Severe cases were over-represented: 64 (72.7%) had a platelet count < 50 x 10(9)/L and 32 (36.4%) died. There was no intrafamilial spread or healthcare-associated infection. The viral S segments from 11 patients presenting in 2013 and 2014 were all grouped in Asia 1 (IV) lineage.
   Conclusions CCHF is well-established throughout Oman, with a single strain of virus present for at least 20 years. Most patients are men involved in animal husbandry and butchery. The high mortality suggests that there is substantial under-diagnosis of milder cases. Preventive measures have been introduced to reduce risks of transmission to animal handlers and butchers and to maintain safety in healthcare settings.

AB Dengue is an important public health problem in the Philippines. We sought to describe the trends in dengue research in the country. We searched four databases and identified published studies on dengue research in the Philippines during the past 60 years. We reviewed 135 eligible studies, of which 33% were descriptive epidemiologic studies or case series, 16% were entomologic or vector control studies, 12% were studies on dengue virology and serologic response, 10% were socio-behavioral and economics studies, 8% were clinical trials, 7% were on burden of disease, 7% were investigations on markers of disease severity, 5% were on dengue diagnostics, and 2% were modeling studies. During the last decade, dengue research in the Philippines has increased and evolved from simple descriptive studies to those with more complex and diverse designs. We identified several key topics where more research would be useful.
   Author summary Dengue is a disease caused by four separate but related viruses transmitted by mosquitos. In this systematic review, we aimed to describe dengue research in the Philippines, where the disease is of great concern, to better understand the types of dengue research and the main findings and important gaps. We identified 135 studies that described dengue research in the Philippines during the past 60 years. Our review showed that in the early years, dengue studies were mainly simple descriptive studies and case reports. Recently the types of investigations have become more complex and diverse, reflecting advancement in local research capacity and infrastructure but more research activity would be beneficial in several areas.

AB Background In Mexico, estimates of Chagas disease prevalence and burden vary widely. Updating surveillance data is therefore an important priority to ensure that Chagas disease does not remain a barrier to the development of Mexico's most vulnerable populations.
   Methodology/Principal findings The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to analyze the literature on epidemiological surveys to estimate Chagas disease prevalence and burden in Mexico, during the period 2006 to 2017. A total of 2,764 articles were screened and 36 were retained for the final analysis. Epidemiological surveys have been performed in most of Mexico, but with variable study scale and geographic coverage. Based on studies reporting confirmed cases (i.e. using at least 2 serological tests), and taking into account the differences in sample sizes, the national estimated seroprevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection was 3.38% [95%CI 2.59-4.16], suggesting that there are 4.06 million cases in Mexico. Studies focused on pregnant women, which may transmit the parasite to their newborn during pregnancy, reported an estimated seroprevalence of 2.21% [95%CI 1.46-2.96], suggesting that there are 50,675 births from T. cruzi infected pregnant women per year, and 3,193 cases of congenitally infected newborns per year. Children under 18 years had an estimated seropositivity rate of 1.51% [95%CI 0.77-2.25], which indicate ongoing transmission. Cases of T. cruzi infection in blood donors have also been reported in most states, with a national estimated seroprevalence of 0.55% [95%CI 0.43-0.66].
   Conclusions/Significance Our analysis suggests a disease burden for T. cruzi infection higher than previously recognized, highlighting the urgency of establishing Chagas disease surveillance and control as a key national public health priority in Mexico, to ensure that it does not remain a major barrier to the economic and social development of the country's most vulnerable populations.

TI Relationship between toxoplasmosis and obsessive compulsive disorder: A
   systematic review and meta-analysis
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES

   STATEMENT; RISK
AB Background A few studies investigated the relationship between toxoplasmosis and mental disorders, such as obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). However, the specific nature of the association between Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) infection and OCD is not yet clear. The aim of this study was to collect information on the relationship between OCD and toxoplasmosis and assess whether patients with toxoplasmosis are prone to OCD.
   Methods For the purpose of this study, 6 major electronic databases and the Internet search engine Google Scholar were searched for the published articles up to July 30(th), 2018 with no restriction of language. The inverse variance method and the random effect model were used to combine the data. The values of odds ratio (OR) were estimated at 95% confidence interval (CI).
   Results A total of 9 case-control and 3 cross-sectional studies were included in our systematic review. However, 11 of these 12 articles were entered into the meta-analysis containing 9873 participants, out of whom 389 were with OCD (25.96% positive for toxoplasmosis) and 9484 were without OCD (17.12% positive for toxoplasmosis). The estimation of the random effect model indicated a significant common OR of 1.96 [95% CI: 1.32-2.90].
   Conclusion This systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that toxoplasmosis could be as an associated factor for OCD (OR = 1.96). However, further prospective investigations are highly recommended to illuminate the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of T. gondii infection in OCD and to better investigate the relationship between OCD and T. gondii infection.
   Author summary Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is an obligate neurotropic parasite that infected about 25-30% of the total human population in the developed and developing countries. The obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disease that affects the income and quality of life. Some studies confirmed an association between infectious agents as the associated or protective factors specifying the development of psychiatry diseases. Among various pathogens associated with psychological disorders, most of the attention is on T. gondii, which has a life-long asymptomatic latent phase after a short acute stage in healthy individuals. The detrimental effect of T. gondii on immunocompromised people and pregnant women is an important concern for public health. The correlation between toxoplasmosis and OCD is still relatively understudied with a paucity of documented findings. The previous meta-analysis reviewed only two studies and reported a 3.4-fold greater chance of OCD. The results of our study presented stronger evidence of a positive relationship between toxoplasmosis and OCD. Eventually, our research team hopes to present an overview of what is known and encourage more intensive research to determine the real impact of this parasite on the occurrence of OCD that may contribute to the prevention of OCD worldwide.

AB Leishmaniasis is a zoonotic disease of worldwide relevance. Visceral leishmaniasis is endemic in Brazil, where it is caused by Leishmania infantum with Lutzomyia longipalpis being the most important invertebrate vector. Non-human primates are susceptible to L. infantum infection. However, little is known about the role of these species as reservoirs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the transmissibility potential of visceral leishmaniasis by non-human primates through xenodiagnosis using the phlebotomine Lu. longipalpis as well as to identify phlebotomine species prevalent in the area where the primates were kept in captivity, and assess infection by Leishmania in captured phlebotomine specimens. Fifty two non-human primates kept in captivity in an endemic area for leishmaniasis were subjected to xenodiagnosis. All primates were serologically tested for detection of anti-Leishmania antibodies. Additionally, an anti-Lu. longipalpis saliva ELISA was performed. Sand flies fed on all animals were tested by qPCR to identify and quantify L. infantum promastigotes. Eight of the 52 non-human primates were positive by xenodiagnosis, including three Pan troglodytes, three Leontopithecus rosalia, one Sapajus apella, and one Miopithecus talapoin, with estimated numbers of promastigotes ranging from 5.67 to 1,181.93 per g of DNA. Positive animals had higher levels of IgG anti-Lu. longipalpis saliva when compared to negative animals, prior to xenodiagnosis. Captive non-human primates are capable of infecting Lu. longipalpis with L. infantum. Our findings also demonstrate the relevance of non-human primates as sentinels to zoonotic diseases. Several phlebotomine species, including Lu. longipalpis, have been identified in the area where the primates were maintained, but only one pool of Lutzomyia lenti was infected with L. infantum. This study has implications for public health strategies and conservation medicine.
   Author summary Visceral leishmaniasis is a zoonotic disease with worldwide distribution. The disease is endemic in several Brazilian regions, including the city of Belo Horizonte, where visceral leishmaniasis is caused by Leishmania infantum and transmitted by Lutzomyia longipalpis. This study evaluated the competence of non-human primates to infect Lutzomyia longipalpis with Leishmania infantum. Eight of 52 non-human primates were positive to leishmaniasis by xenodiagnosis, i.e. capable of infecting sand flies, with averages of 5.67 to 1,181.93 promastigotes/g of DNA. Positive animals had higher levels of IgG anti-Lu. longipalpis saliva when compared to negative animals, prior to xenodiagnosis. This study highlights the importance of non-human primates in the leishmaniasis cycle, providing information that is relevant for development of better public health strategies, and to conservation medicine.

AB Background The cestode Taenia solium causes the neglected (zoonotic) tropical disease cysticercosis, a leading cause of preventable epilepsy in endemic low and middle-income countries. Transmission models can inform current scaling-up of control efforts by helping to identify, validate and optimise control and elimination strategies as proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
   Methodology/Principal findings A systematic literature search was conducted using the PRISMA approach to identify and compare existing T. solium transmission models, and related Taeniidae infection transmission models. In total, 28 modelling papers were identified, of which four modelled T. solium exclusively. Different modelling approaches for T. solium included deterministic, Reed-Frost, individual-based, decision-tree, and conceptual frameworks. Simulated interventions across models agreed on the importance of coverage for impactful effectiveness to be achieved. Other Taeniidae infection transmission models comprised force-of-infection (FoI), population-based (mainly Echinococcus granulosus) and individual-based (mainly E. multilocularis) modelling approaches. Spatial structure has also been incorporated (E. multilocularis and Taenia ovis) in recognition of spatial aggregation of parasite eggs in the environment and movement of wild animal host populations.
   Conclusions/Significance Gaps identified from examining the wider Taeniidae family models highlighted the potential role of FoI modelling to inform model parameterisation, as well as the need for spatial modelling and suitable structuring of interventions as key areas for future T. solium model development. We conclude that working with field partners to address data gaps and conducting cross-model validation with baseline and longitudinal data will be critical to building consensus-led and epidemiological setting-appropriate intervention strategies to help fulfil the WHO targets.
   Author summary Taenia solium infection in humans (taeniosis and neurocysticercosis) and pigs (cysticercosis) presents a significant global public health and economic challenge. The World Health Organization has called for validated strategies and wider consensus on which strategies are suitable for different epidemiological settings to support successful T. solium control and elimination efforts. Transmission models can be used to inform these strategies. Therefore, a modelling review was undertaken to assess the current state and gaps relating to T. solium epidemiological modelling. The literature surrounding models for other Taeniidae family infections was also considered, identifying approaches to aid further development of existing T. solium models. A variety of different modelling approaches have been used for T. solium including differences in structural and parametric assumptions associated with T. solium transmission biology. Despite these differences, all models agreed on the importance of coverage on intervention effectiveness. Other Taeniidae family models highlighted the need for incorporating spatial structure when necessary to capture aggregation of transmission stages in the environment and movement of animal hosts.

TI Epidemiological features of a recent zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis
   outbreak in Zagora province, southern Morocco
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES

DT Article
ID ENDEMIC FOCUS; PHLEBOTOMUS; DISEASES
AB Background Leishmania major is an endemic vector-borne disease in Morocco that causes zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL), especially in arid pre-Saharan regions where its unique vector and reservoir are Phlebotomus papatasi and Meriones shawi, respectively, and may cause epidemics. In late 2017, the Zagora province, an endemic focus for ZCL in southern Morocco, had CL outbreak. The main objective of our investigation was to analyze the epidemiological features of this latest ZCL outbreak.
   Methodology/Principal findings We analyzed epidemiological features of this latest ZCL outbreak. The Regional Delegation of Health, Zagora, recorded 4,402 CL patients between October 2017 and end of March 2018. Our findings showed that 24 municipalities were affected and majority (55.1%) of infected cases belonged to the Tinzouline rural municipality. Majority of patients were females (57.2%). While all age group patients were affected, those aged <10 years were the most affected (42.1%). During this outbreak over 5 days in December 2017, we conducted a survey in Tinzouline and recruited and sampled 114 CL patients to confirm CL diagnosis by parasitological (direct examination and culture) and molecular (ITS1-PCR) methods and identify the etiological agent of infection using ITS1-PCR-RFLP and sequencing. We completed a detailed questionnaire including clinical and epidemiological data for each patient and found 72.8% of patients presenting multiple lesions (2), with an average number of lesions of 5.16 0.5. Lesions were more prevalent in the upper limbs, with the most common type being the ulcerocrusted lesion (60.5%). We detected no associations between lesion type and patients' sex or age.
   Conclusions/Significance Among 114 clinically diagnosed CL patients, we confirmed 90.35% and identified L. major as the species responsible for this outbreak. Self-medication using various products caused superinfection and inflammation of lesions and complicated the diagnosis and treatment. Thus, ZCL remains a major public health problem in the Zagora province, and commitment of all stakeholders is urgently required to implement a sustainable regional control program.
   Author summary Zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) caused by Leishmania major is endemic in Morocco, especially in the arid pre-Saharan regions. Its main characteristics are rurality and proneness to epidemics. Zagora province an endemic focus for ZCL has been recently the scene of an important CL outbreak. Data analysis of 4,402 CL patients recorded in Zagora province, from October 2017 till Mars 2018 showed that 24 municipalities were affected to different extents; the important percent of cases belonged to Tinouzline, a rural municipality. While all age group patients were affected, children under 10 years old were the most affected. Majority of patients were female; the disfiguring CL scars often lead to the stigmatization of women and impact on their psychosocial lives. Lesions were diverse and pleiotropic ranging from a single lesion to multiple disfiguring sores, with, in extreme cases, as many as 35 lesions. Leishmania major was identified as the Leishmania species responsible of this outbreak. Self-medication by using various products caused superinfection and inflammation of lesions and complicated the diagnosis and treatment. Thus, ZCL remains a major public health problem in Zagora province, and commitment of all stakeholders is urgently required to implement a sustainable regional control program.

AB Leptospira is a highly heterogeneous bacterial genus that can be divided into three evolutionary lineages and >300 serovars. The causative agents of leptospirosis are responsible of an emerging zoonotic disease worldwide. To advance our understanding of the biodiversity of Leptospira strains at the global level, we evaluated the performance of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) as a genus-wide strain classification and genotyping tool. Herein we propose a set of 545 highly conserved loci as a core genome MLST (cgMLST) genotyping scheme applicable to the entire Leptospira genus, including non-pathogenic species. Evaluation of cgMLST genotyping was undertaken with 509 genomes, including 327 newly sequenced genomes, from diverse species, sources and geographical locations. Phylogenetic analysis showed that cgMLST defines species, clades, subclades, clonal groups and cgMLST sequence types (cgST), with high precision and robustness to missing data. Novel Leptospira species, including a novel subclade named S2 (saprophytes 2), were identified. We defined clonal groups (CG) optimally using a single-linkage clustering threshold of 40 allelic mismatches. While some CGs such as L. interrogans CG6 (serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae) are globally distributed, others are geographically restricted. cgMLST was congruent with classical MLST schemes, but had greatly improved resolution and broader applicability. Single nucleotide polymorphisms within single cgST groups was limited to <30 SNPs, underlining a potential role for cgMLST in epidemiological surveillance. Finally, cgMLST allowed identification of serogroups and closely related serovars. In conclusion, the proposed cgMLST strategy allows high-resolution genotyping of Leptospira isolates across the phylogenetic breadth of the genus. The unified genomic taxonomy of Leptospira strains, available publicly at http://bigsdb.pasteur.fr/leptospira, will facilitate global harmonization of Leptospira genotyping, strain emergence follow-up and novel collaborative studies of the epidemiology and evolution of this emerging pathogen.
   Author summary Leptospirosis, caused by pathogenic Leptospira strains, is an emerging bacterial zoonotic disease mostly affecting humans in tropical countries. Despite its public health importance, little is known about the strains that are circulating worldwide due to the lack of a universal common language on strain types. In this work we describe a new strain genotyping and classification system that is highly standardized, thus facilitating global collaboration, and that can discriminate all members of the Leptospira genus at high resolution. We then examine the genetic diversity of Leptospira strains from different origins. This study provides a framework for optimizing diagnostic methods and epidemiological surveillance of leptospirosis.

TI Vector competence of Australian Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus for
   an epidemic strain of Zika virus

AB Background Recent epidemics of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Pacific and the Americas have highlighted its potential as an emerging pathogen of global importance. Both Aedes (Ae.) aegypti and Ae. albopictus are known to transmit ZIKV but variable vector competence has been observed between mosquito populations from different geographical regions and different virus strains. Since Australia remains at risk of ZIKV introduction, we evaluated the vector competence of local Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus for a Brazilian epidemic ZIKV strain. In addition, we evaluated the impact of daily temperature fluctuations around a mean of 28 degrees C on ZIKV transmission and extrinsic incubation period.
   Methodology/Principal findings Mosquitoes were orally challenged with a Brazilian ZIKV strain (8.8 log CCID50/ml) and maintained at either 28 degrees C constant or fluctuating temperature conditions. At 3, 7 and 14 days post-infection (dpi), ZIKV RNA copies were quantified in mosquito bodies, as well as wings and legs, using qRT-PCR, while virus antigen in saliva (a proxy for transmission) was detected using a cell culture ELISA. Despite high body and disseminated infection rates in both vectors, the transmission rates of ZIKV in saliva of Ae. aegypti (50-60%) were significantly higher than in Ae. albopictus (10%) at 14 dpi. Both species supported a high viral load in bodies, with no significant differences between constant and fluctuating temperature conditions. However, a significant difference in viral load in wings and legs between species was observed, with higher titres in Ae. aegypti maintained at constant temperature conditions. For ZIKV transmission to occur in Ae. aegypti, a disseminated virus load threshold of 7.59 log(10) copies had to be reached.
   Conclusions/Significance Australian Ae. aegypti are better able to transmit a Brazilian ZIKV strain than Ae. albopictus. The results are in agreement with the global consensus that Ae. aegypti is the major vector of ZIKV.
   Author summary Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen that generally causes a mild febrile illness but mostly remains asymptomatic in 50-80% of infections. Infection during pregnancy can cause congenital malformations, notably microcephaly. In adults, it can cause Guillain-Barre syndrome. The recent ZIKV epidemic in the Americas has been linked to the urban vector Aedes aegypti. The presence of the species in Australia makes the region vulnerable to emerging mosquito-borne viruses. A mosquito's competence to transmit a pathogen will depend on both the virus and vector strains. Here, we determine the vector competence of Australian Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes for a ZIKV epidemic strain, originating from the epicentre of the Brazilian outbreak, under constant and fluctuating temperatures that simulate field environments in Australia. Our results demonstrate that, although both species were susceptible to ZIKV infection, Ae. aegypti is more likely to transmit virus. Our results may aid in the formulation of public health strategies to mitigate the threat of ZIKV.

AB Arboviral disease transmission by Aedes mosquitoes poses a major challenge to public health systems in Ecuador, where constraints on health services and resource allocation call for spatially informed management decisions. Employing a unique dataset of larval occurrence records provided by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Health, we used ecological niche models (ENMs) to estimate the current geographic distribution of Aedes aegypti in Ecuador, using mosquito presence as a proxy for risk of disease transmission. ENMs built with the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Production (GARP) algorithm and a suite of environmental variables were assessed for agreement and accuracy. The top model of larval mosquito presence was projected to the year 2050 under various combinations of greenhouse gas emissions scenarios and models of climate change. Under current climatic conditions, larval mosquitoes were not predicted in areas of high elevation in Ecuador, such as the Andes mountain range, as well as the eastern portion of the Amazon basin. However, all models projected to scenarios of future climate change demonstrated potential shifts in mosquito distribution, wherein range contractions were seen throughout most of eastern Ecuador, and areas of transitional elevation became suitable for mosquito presence. Encroachment of Ae. aegypti into mountainous terrain was estimated to affect up to 4,215 km(2) under the most extreme scenario of climate change, an area which would put over 12,000 people currently living in transitional areas at risk. This distributional shift into communities at higher elevations indicates an area of concern for public health agencies, as targeted interventions may be needed to protect vulnerable populations with limited prior exposure to mosquito-borne diseases. Ultimately, the results of this study serve as a tool for informing public health policy and mosquito abatement strategies in Ecuador.
   Author summary The yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti) is a medically important vector of arboviral diseases in Ecuador, such as dengue fever and chikungunya. Managing Ae. aegypti is a challenge to public health agencies in Latin America, where the use of limited resources must be planned in an efficient, targeted manner. The spatial distribution of Ae. aegypti can be used as a proxy for risk of disease exposure, guiding policy formation and decision-making. We used ecological niche models in this study to predict the range of Ae. aegypti in Ecuador, based on agency larval mosquito surveillance records and layers of environmental predictors (e.g. climate, elevation, and human population). The best models of current range were then projected to the year 2050 under a variety of greenhouse gas emissions scenarios and models of climate change. All modeled future scenarios predicted shifts in the range of Ae. aegypti, allowing us to assess human populations that may be at risk of becoming exposed to Aedes vectored diseases. As climate changes, we predict that communities living in areas of transitional elevation along the Andes mountain range are vulnerable to the expansion of Ae. aegypti.

TI Urban villages as transfer stations for dengue fever epidemic: A case

AB Background Numerous urban villages (UVs) and frequent infectious disease outbreaks are major environmental and public health concerns in highly urbanized regions, especially in developing countries. However, the spatial and quantitative associations between UVs and infections remain little understood on a fine scale.
   Methodology and principal findings In this study, the relationships between reported dengue fever (DF) epidemics during 2012-2017, gross domestic product (GDP), the traffic system (road density, bus and/or subway stations), and UVs derived from high-resolution remotely sensed imagery in the central area of Guangzhou, were explored using geographically weighted regression (GWR) models based on a 1 km x 1 km grid scale. Accounting for 16.53%-18.07% of residential area and 16.84%-18.02% of population, UVs possessed 28.55%-38.24% of total reported DF cases in the core area of Guangzhou. The density of DF cases and the DF incidence rates in UVs were 1.81-3.13 and 1.82-3.06 times of that of normal construction land. Approximately 90% of the total cases were concentrated in the UVs and their buffering zones of radius ranged from 0 to 500 m. Significantly positive associations were observed between gridded DF incidence rates and UV area (r = 0.33, P = 0.000), the number of bus stops (r = 0.49, P = 0.000) and subway stations (r = 0.27, P = 0.000), and road density (r = 0.39, P = 0.000). About 60% of spatial variations in the gridded DF incidence rates were interpreted by the different variables of GDP, UVs, and bus stops integrated in GWR models.
   Conclusions UVs likely acted as special transfer stations, receiving and/or exporting DF cases during epidemics. This work increases our understanding of the influences of UVs on vector-borne diseases in highly urbanized areas, supplying valuable clues to local authorities making targeted interventions for the prevention and control of DF epidemics.
   Author summary Due to the rapid urbanization of China, many villages in the urban fringe are enveloped by ever-expanding cities and become so-called urban villages (UVs). UVs are widely distributed in not only the Guangzhou core areas but also the other cities in the highly urbanized region of China (e.g., Shenzhen, Wuhan). UVs are commonly featured by poor sanitation, overcrowding population, absent infrastructure, and some environmental pollution due to the development is neither authorized nor planned, resulting in a high environmental suitability for some vectors (e.g., Aedes albopictus), as well as the vetor-borne diseases (i.e., dengue fever) in these regions. In this study, we demonstrated that UVs may serve as transfer stations for the transmission of DF epidemic in the regions with developed transportation, higher GDP and dense population. This is manifested as that the rates of DF incidences were significantly positively associated with UV area. Furthermore, the density of DF cases and the DF incidence rates in UVs were 1.81-3.13 and 1.82-3.06 times of that of normal construction land and about 90% of the total DF cases were concentrated in 500m radius of UVs' buffers. And the aggregation effects of UVs on this epidemic in the central region were obviously affected by public traffic conditions at the grid level. This study is the first quantitative analysis of the spatial relationship between UVs, public transportation, road density, population density, GDP and DF epidemics, which will provide a useful reference for accurately preventing and controlling DF epidemic in urban regions with numerous UVs.

TI A community-based knowledge, attitude, and practice survey on rabies
   among cattle owners in selected areas of Bhutan
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID AWARENESS
AB Rabies remains a disease of significant zoonotic and economic concern in rabies endemic areas of Bhutan. Rabies outbreaks in livestock threaten the livelihoods of subsistence farming communities and pose a potential public health threat. As a part of identifying approaches to prevent rabies in cattle, a Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) survey was conducted among cattle owners in selected rural areas of the southern rabies high-risk zone and low-risk zone in eastern Bhutan. Between March and April 2017, 562 cattle owners (281 in the east and 281 in the south) were interviewed using a questionnaire. Eighty-eight percent of the participants had heard of rabies but only 39% of the participants who had heard of rabies had adequate knowledge about rabies. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that residing in the south [OR = 9.25 (95% CI: 6.01-14.53)] and having seen a rabies case [OR = 2.46 (95% CI: 1.6-3.82)] were significantly associated with having adequate knowledge about rabies. Based on our scoring criteria, 65% of the total participants who had heard of rabies had a favorable attitude towards rabies control and prevention programs. The participants residing in the east were two times more likely to have a favourable attitude than their counterparts in the south [OR = 2.08 (95% CI: 1.43-3.05)]. More than 70% of the participants reported engaging in farm activities such as examining the oral cavity of sick cattle and assisting cattle during parturition. Only 25% of the participants reported using personal protective equipment while undertaking these activities. Despite a high level of rabies awareness, we observed that there is a lack of comprehensive knowledge about rabies regarding susceptible hosts, transmission routes, the health outcome of rabies infection in humans, and appropriate health-seeking behaviours. This study highlights the need to strengthen rabies education programs in rural communities to address the knowledge gaps that have been identified.
   Author summary The impacts of rabies outbreaks in cattle and other livestock are multifold. At the local level, economic losses resulting from the direct loss of cattle and the animal's future productivity is a significant threat to the livelihoods of subsistence farming communities. Besides, rabies in livestock poses a potential public health threat associated with human exposures that result during handling sick animals and dressing carcasses of animals that had died of rabies. Furthermore, the Government incurs costs for responding to outbreaks and providing post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to potentially exposed individuals. We conducted a KAP questionnaire surveys among cattle owners in two selected study areas of Bhutan to understand the level of rabies awareness among the cattle owners, their attitude towards rabies prevention and control and to identify existing on-farm practices that can result in potential exposure to rabies in animals and humans. We observed that there was a lack of comprehensive knowledge about rabies especially regarding the post exposure care and outcome of rabies infection in humans and animals. Given that most participants lacked knowledge about clinical signs of rabies in cattle their engagement in practices such as examining oral cavity, assisting cattle during parturition and dressing wounds without wearing minimal protective equipment, was concerning. Our study identifies the need to extend rabies education into the rural communities of Bhutan. Furthermore, our findings reiterate the importance of rabies education as a crucial component of the global initiative to eliminate dog-mediated rabies in humans and animals.

AB Zika virus (ZIKV), a member of the Flaviviridae family, has emerged as a major public health threat, since ZIKV infection has been connected to microcephaly and other neurological disorders. Flavivirus genome replication is driven by NS5, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) that also contains a N-terminal methyltransferase domain essential for viral mRNA capping. Given its crucial roles, ZIKV NS5 has become an attractive antiviral target. Here, we have used integrated structural biology approaches to characterize the supramolecular arrangement of the full-length ZIKV NS5, highlighting the assembly and interfaces between NS5 monomers within a dimeric structure, as well as the dimer-dimer interactions to form higher order fibril-like structures. The relative orientation of each monomer within the dimer provides a model to explain the coordination between MTase and RdRP domains across neighboring NS5 molecules and mutational studies underscore the crucial role of the MTase residues Y25, K28 and K29 in NS5 dimerization. The basic residue K28 also participates in GTP binding and competition experiments indicate that NS5 dimerization is disrupted at high GTP concentrations. This competition represents a first glimpse at a molecular level explaining how dimerization might regulate the capping process.
   Author summary The lack of vaccine or antiviral drugs to combat Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has encouraged scientists to characterize in depth potential drug targets. One attractive candidate is NS5, responsible for the catalysis of the 5'-RNA capping, methylation and RNA synthesis, during flavivirus genome replication. To fulfill these activities, the methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domains of NS5 need to cooperate with each other. The structural and biophysical data presented in this work demonstrate that the ZIKV NS5 protein has the ability to form dimers, as well as higher order oligomers that may participate in the fine-tuning regulation of the multiple enzyme functions in the replication complex. In addition, we have found that NS5 dimerization is disrupted at high GTP concentrations, explaining how dimerization might regulate the capping process.

TI Whole-genome and targeted sequencing of drug-resistant Mycobacterium
   tuberculosis on the iSeq100 and MiSeq: A performance, ease-of-use, and
   cost evaluation
SO PLOS MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background Accurate, comprehensive, and timely detection of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is essential to inform patient treatment and enable public health surveillance. This is crucial for effective control of TB globally. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches have potential as rapid in vitro diagnostics (IVDs), but the complexity of workflows, interpretation of results, high costs, and vulnerability of instrumentation have been barriers to broad uptake outside of reference laboratories, especially in low- and middle-income countries. A new, solid-state, tabletop sequencing instrument, Illumina iSeq100, has the potential to decentralize NGS for individual patient care.
   Methods and findings In this study, we evaluated WGS and targeted NGS for TB on both the new iSeq100 and the widely used MiSeq (both manufactured by Illumina) and compared sequencing performance, costs, and usability. We utilized DNA libraries produced from Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates for the evaluation. We conducted WGS on three strains and observed equivalent uniform genome coverage with both platforms and found the depth of coverage obtained was consistent with the expected data output. Utilizing the standardized, cloud-based ReSeqTB bioinformatics pipeline for variant analysis, we found the two platforms to have 94.0% (CI 93.1%-94.8%) agreement, in comparison to 97.6% (CI 97%-98.1%) agreement for the same libraries on two MiSeq instruments. For the targeted NGS approach, 46 M. tuberculosis-specific amplicon libraries had 99.6% (CI 98.0%-99.9%) agreement between the iSeq100 and MiSeq data sets in drug resistance-associated SNPs. The upfront capital costs are almost 5-fold lower for the iSeq100 ($19,900 USD) platform in comparison to the MiSeq ($99,000 USD); however, because of difference in the batching capabilities, the price per sample for WGS was higher on the iSeq100. For WGS of M. tuberculosis at the minimum depth of coverage of 30x, the cost per sample on the iSeq100 was $69.44 USD versus $28.21 USD on the MiSeq, assuming a 2 x 150 bp run on a v3 kit. In terms of ease of use, the sequencing workflow of iSeq100 has been optimized to only require 27 minutes total of hands-on time pre- and post-run, and the maintenance is simplified by a single-use cartridge-based fluidic system. As these are the first sequencing attempts on the iSeq100 for M. tuberculosis, the sequencing pool loading concentration still needs optimization, which will affect sequencing error and depth of coverage. Additionally, the costs are based on current equipment and reagent costs, which are subject to change.
   Conclusions The iSeq100 instrument is capable of running existing TB WGS and targeted NGS library preparations with comparable accuracy to the MiSeq. The iSeq100 has reduced sequencing workflow hands-on time and is able to deliver sequencing results in <24 hours. Reduced capital and maintenance costs and lower-throughput capabilities also give the iSeq100 an advantage over MiSeq in settings of individualized care but not in high-throughput settings such as reference laboratories, where sample batching can be optimized to minimize cost at the expense of workflow complexity and time.

TI Evaluation of a social protection policy on tuberculosis treatment
   outcomes: A prospective cohort study
SO PLOS MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID PROPENSITY SCORE; TRIAL; BIAS
AB Background Tuberculosis (TB) still represents a major public health problem in Latin America, with low success and high default rates. Poor adherence represents a major threat for TB control and promotes emergence of drug-resistant TB. Expanding social protection programs could have a substantial effect on the global burden of TB; however, there is little evidence to evaluate the outcomes of socioeconomic support interventions. This study evaluated the effect of a conditional cash transfer (CCT) policy on treatment success and default rates in a prospective cohort of socioeconomically disadvantaged patients.
   Methods and findings Data were collected on adult patients with first diagnosis of pulmonary TB starting treatment in public healthcare facilities (HCFs) from 16 health departments with high TB burden in Buenos Aires who were followed until treatment completion or abandonment. The main exposure of interest was the registration to receive the CCT. Other covariates, such as sociodemographic and clinical variables and HCFs' characteristics usually associated with treatment adherence and outcomes, were also considered in the analysis. We used hierarchical models, propensity score (PS) matching, and inverse probability weighting (IPW) to estimate treatment effects, adjusting for individual and health system confounders. Of 941 patients with known CCT status, 377 registered for the program showed significantly higher success rates (82% versus 69%) and lower default rates (11% versus 20%). After controlling for individual and system characteristics and modality of treatment, odds ratio (OR) for success was 2.9 (95% CI 2, 4.3, P < 0.001) and default was 0.36 (95% CI 0.23, 0.57, P < 0.001). As this is an observational study evaluating an intervention not randomly assigned, there might be some unmeasured residual confounding. Although it is possible that a small number of patients was not registered into the program because they were deemed not eligible, the majority of patients fulfilled the requirements and were not registered because of different reasons. Since the information on the CCT was collected at the end of the study, we do not know the exact timing for when each patient was registered for the program.
   Conclusions The CCT appears to be a valuable health policy intervention to improve TB treatment outcomes. Incorporating these interventions as established policies may have a considerable effect on the control of TB in similar high-burden areas.

ID HIV/AIDS; EFFICIENCY; CRITERIA
AB BackgroundWhile there has been progress in controlling the HIV epidemic, HIV still remains a disease of global concern. Some of the progress has been attributed to increased public awareness and uptake of public health interventions, as well as increased access to anti- retroviral treatment and the prevention of vertical HIV transmission. These interventions would not have been possible without substantial investments in HIV programs. However, donor fatigue introduces the need for low income countries to maximize the benefits of the available resources. This necessitates identification of priorities that should be funded. Evaluating prioritization processes would enable decision makers to assess the effectiveness of their processes, thereby designing intervention strategies. To date most evaluations have focused on cost-benefit analyses, which overlooks additional critical impacts of priority setting decisions. Kapiriri & Martin (2010) developed and validated a comprehensive framework for evaluating PS in low income countries.The objective of this paper report findings from a comprehensive evaluation of priority setting for HIV in Uganda, using the framework; and to identify lessons of good practice and areas for improvement.MethodsThis was a qualitative study based on forty interviews with decision makers and policy document review. Data were analysed using INVIVO 10, and based on the parameters in Kapiriri et al's evaluation framework.ResultsWe found that HIV enjoys political support, which contributes to the availability of resources, strong planning institutions, and participatory prioritization process based on some criteria. Some of the identified limitations included; undue donor and political influence, priorities not being publicized, and lack of mechanisms for appealing the decisions. HIV prioritization had both positive and negative impacts on the health system.ConclusionsThe framework facilitated a more comprehensive evaluation of HIV priority setting. While there were successful areas, the process could be strengthened by minimizing undue influence of external actors, and support the legitimate institutions to set priorities and implement them. These should also institute mechanisms for publicizing the decisions, appeals and increased accountability. While this paper looked at HIV, the framework is flexible enough to be used in evaluating priority setting for other health programs within similar context.

AB BackgroundChildhood malnutrition is a critical public health concern in Pakistan. We aimed to explore factors associated with malnutrition in Pakistani children (<5years of age) using the Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS) 2012-2013.MethodsSample of 3071 Pakistani children aged 0-59months from the PDHS 2012-2013, with complete anthropometric measurements were included in the study. Nutritional status was evaluated using anthropometric indices; height-for-age, weight-for-height and weight-for-age, as proxy measures of three forms of under-five malnutrition including stunting, wasting and underweight respectively. Uni- and multivariate binary logistic regressions were used to examine the association between selected maternal-socio-demographic and child level variables (such as child sex, age, size at birth, antenatal clinic visits, recent diarrheal incidence and breastfeeding status) and three proxy measures of child nutritional status.ResultsAbout 44.4% of under-five children were stunted, 29.4% were underweight and10.7% were wasted. Children whose mothers lived in rural areas (aOR=0.67, 95%CI 0.48-0.92), were aged 18years at marriage (aOR=0.76, 95%CI 0.59-0.99) and had visited antenatal clinic more than 3 times during pregnancy (aOR=0.61, 95%CI 0.38-0.98) were less likely to be stunted. Mother's low educational level (aOR=2.55, 95%CI 1.26-5.17), short stature (aOR=2.31, 95%CI 1.34-3.98), child's small size at birth (aOR=1.67, 95%CI 1.14-2.45) and mother's BMI were significantly associated with child's underweight status. Children whose mothers had no education were more likely to be wasted (aOR=3.61, 95%CI 1.33-9.82).ConclusionThe study suggests that most of the analysed factors that accounted for malnutrition in Pakistani children (such as mother's age at marriage, educational level and mothers' nutritional status) are preventable. Therefore, to reduce the burden of malnutrition interventions that can address these factors are required such as community based education and targeted nutritional interventions.

TI Prevalence estimation of Italian ovine cystic echinococcosis in

SO PLOS ONE
LA English

ID ALVEOLAR ECHINOCOCCOSIS; PARATUBERCULOSIS
AB Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a complex zoonosis with domestic and sylvatic life-cycles, involving different intermediate and definitive host species. Many previous studies have highlighted the lack of a surveillance system for CE, its persistence in Italy, and endemicity in several Italian regions. Because of the absence of a uniform surveillance program for both humans and animals, disease occurrence is widely underestimated. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of ovine CE in Italy. Survey data on the prevalence of Echinococcus granulosus complex infections in Italian sheep farms from 2010 to 2015 were obtained in collaboration with Regional Veterinary Epidemiology Observatories (OEVRs). Bayesian analysis was performed to estimate the true CE farm prevalence. The prior true CE prevalence was estimated using data from Sardinia. Second, Bayesian modelling of the observed prevalence in different regions and the true prevalence estimation from the first step were used to ultimately estimate the prevalence of ovine CE in Italy. We obtained survey data from 10 OEVRs, covering 14 Italian regions. We observed that the risk of CE infection decreased over the years, and it was strictly correlated with the density of susceptible species. Using Sardinia as prior distribution, where the disease farm prevalence was approximately 19% (95% CI, 18.82-20.02), we estimated that the highest endemic CE farm prevalence was in Basilicata with a value of 12% (95% BCI: 7.49-18.9%) and in Piemonte 7.64%(95% BCI: 4.12-13.04%). Our results provide spatially relevant data crucial for guiding CE control in Italy. Precise information on disease occurrence location would aid in the identification of priority areas for disease control implementation by the authorities. The current underestimation of CE occurrence should urge the Italian and European governments to become aware of the public health importance of CE and implement targeted interventions for high-risk areas.

TI Cost and operational impact of promoting upfront GeneXpert MTB/RIF test
   referrals for presumptive pediatric tuberculosis patients in India
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   Outreach and promotion programs are essential to ensuring uptake of new public health interventions and guidelines. We assessed the costs and operation dynamics of outreach and promotion efforts for up front Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) testing for pediatric presumptive tuberculosis (TB) patients in four major Indian cities.
   Methods
   Xpert test costs were assessed as weighted average per-test costs based on the daily workload dynamics matched by test volume specific Xpert unit cost at each study site. Costs of outreach programs to recruit health providers to refer pediatric patients for Xpert testing were assessed as cost per referral for each quarter based on total program costs and referral data. All costs were assessed in the health service provider's perspective and expressed in 2015 USD.
   Results
   Weighted average per-test costs ranged from $14.71 to $17.81 at the four laboratories assessed. Differences between laboratories were associated with unused testing capacity and/or frequencies of overtime work to cope with increasing demand and same-day testing requirements. Outreach activities generated between 825 and 2,065 Xpert testing referrals on average each quarter across the four study sites, translating into $0.63 to $2.55 per patient referred. Overall outreach costs per referral decreased with time, stabilizing at an average cost of $1.10, and demonstrated a clear association with increased referrals.
   Conclusions
   Xpert test and outreach program costs within and across study sites were mainly driven by the dynamics of Xpert testing demand resulting from the combined outreach activities. However, these increases in demand required considerable overtime work resulting in additional costs and operational challenges at the study laboratories. Therefore, careful laboratory operational adjustment should be evaluated at target areas in parallel to the anticipated demand from the Xpert referral outreach program scale-up in other Indian regions.

AB BackgroundAfrican, Caribbean, and Black (Black) men account for 16.5% of new HIV diagnoses among men in Ontario. There is substantial evidence that sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are associated with increased likelihood of HIV infection; however, little is known regarding the prevalence of HIV/STI co-infections among Black men in Toronto. Progress has been made in understanding factors contributing to racial/ethnic disparities in HIV between amongmen who have sex with men (MSM). In this study, weinvestigatewithin-racial group patterns of HIV/STI infection between Black MSM and Black men who only have sex with women (MSW).MethodsA cross-sectional descriptive epidemiological study was conducted with a non-probability sample of Black men recruited from Toronto, Ontario. Audio Computer Assisted Self-Interviews (ACASI) surveys were used to collect demographic and behavioral data. Biological specimens were collected to screen for HIV and other STIs. Chi-Square tests were used to compare the prevalence of (1) HIV and current STIs between MSM and MSW and (2) current STIs between people living with HIV and people not living with HIV. Logistic regression models were constructed to assess whether or not history of STIs were associated with current HIV infection.ResultsThe prevalence of HIV (9.2%), syphilis (7.2%), hepatitis B (2.7%), and high-risk anal HPV (8.4%) and penile HPV (21.3%) infections were high in Black men (N=487) and were significantly increased in Black MSM compared with MSW; the prevalence of syphilis and high-risk HPV were also increased in men living with HIV. Men with a history of syphilis (OR=6.48, 95% CI: 2.68,15.71), genital warts (OR=4.32, 95% CI: 1.79,10.43) or genital ulcers (OR=21.3, 95% CI: 1.89,239.51) had an increased odds of HIV infection.ConclusionsThe HIV/STI prevalence was high among this sample of Black men, although the study design may have led to oversampling of men living with HIV. The associations between STIs and current HIV infection highlight the need for integrated of HIV/STI screening and treatment programs for Black men. Public health strategies are also needed to reduce disproportionate HIV/STI burden among Black MSMincluding improving HPV vaccine coverage.

AB BackgroundChronic respiratory symptoms involving bronchitis, cough and phlegm in children are underappreciated but pose a significant public health burden. Efforts for prevention and management could be supported by an understanding of the relative importance of determinants, including environmental exposures. Thus, we aim to develop a prediction model for bronchitic symptoms.MethodsSchoolchildren from the population-based southern California Children's Health Study were visited annually from 2003 to 2012. Bronchitic symptoms over the prior 12months were assessed by questionnaire. A gradient boosting model was fit using groups of risk factors (including traffic/air pollution exposures) for all children and by asthma status. Training data consisted of one observation per participant in a random study year (for 50% of participants). Validation data consisted of: (1) a random (later) year in the same participants (within-participant); (2) a random year in participants excluded from the training data (across-participant).ResultsAt baseline, 13.2% of children had asthma and 18.1% reported bronchitic symptoms. Models performed similarly within- and across-participant. Previous year symptoms/medication use provided much of the predictive ability (across-participant area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC): 0.76 vs 0.78 for all risk factors, in all participants). Traffic/air pollution exposures added modestly to prediction as did body mass index percentile, age and parent stress.ConclusionsRegardless of asthma status, previous symptoms were the most important predictors of current symptoms. Traffic/air pollution variables contribute modest predictive information, but impact large populations. Methods proposed here could be generalized to personalized exacerbation predictions in future longitudinal studies to support targeted prevention efforts.

DT Article
DE Mortality statistics; Vital registration system; Myanmar
AB BackgroundThe vital registration system is universally recognized as the main source of mortality data which is essential for policy formulation, proper interventions and resource allocation to address priority health challenges. To improve availability and quality of mortality statistics by strengthening the vital registration system, understanding the current vital registration system is essential. This study identified challenges in generating reliable mortality statistics in the vital registration system of Myanmar.MethodsQualitative methods were used to collect data in two selected townships of Mandalay Region. Grey literature related to the management of mortality registration was reviewed; in-depth interviews of sixteen key informants and fourteen focus group discussions were conducted with those involved in death registration at the local level, such as healthcare providers, local administrators and knowledgeable adults in households where deaths occurred during the past three years. Thematic analysis was performed to identify system barriers in the death registration process.ResultsWeaknesses in the death registration system are classified in three areas: a) administrative which includes the lack of enforcement of mandatory death registration, limited issuance of death certificates and no formal mandatory notification of death events by households and; b) technical which includes absence of proper and regular on-the-job trainings, ineffective cause-of-death certification practice for deaths in the communities and the absence of routine data plausibility checks at the local level; and c) societal which includes poor community awareness and inadequate participation in death registration.ConclusionThe study highlighted challenges in the death registration system at the operational level, which undermines the achievement of a satisfactory level of completeness and accuracy of mortality data. We recommend establishing a strong legal framework, improving technical capacities and raising public awareness and cooperation to strengthen the system that can generate reliable mortality statistics.

AB Aims
   To assess the knowledge and practices toward diabetes in the Jordanian community.
   Methods
   This study was conducted as a public based cross-sectional study in different cities in Jordan. A previously published validated questionnaire about knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) toward diabetes mellitus (DM) was translated from the Arabic version and used in this study with very minor modification to be suitable for this study of the Jordanian population.
   Results
   A total of 1,702 participants were recruited in the present study. About half of the participants (53.3%) had good knowledge scores. The respondents' knowledge scores were significantly correlated with attitudes (p < 0.001). The education level (university or higher) and education related to a field were predictors for good knowledge and positive attitudes. About 46.3% of participants had positive attitudes toward the disease. As for practices, 37.7% of participants did not engage in regular exercise while more than half of the study subjects had never checked their blood glucose level on an annual basis. The factors influencing the practice of checking blood glucose level have been investigated.
   Conclusion
   This study has highlighted the need for more educational interventions to address negative attitudes and promote healthy lifestyle practices and regular health checks especially in certain subgroups of patients, such as those not having a degree related to the medical field and not having a first-degree relative with DM.

The intervention mechanism is helpful to facilitate the adoption of the healthcare service goods. We consider a research problem that regulates the supply chain system for healthcare service goods by an intervention mechanism, and two intervention strategies composed of demand-growth strategy and subsidy strategy are used to the combination of intervention mechanism. Then this paper presents a new method based on fuzzy set and bilevel programming to design the intervention mechanism. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we conduct a case study for Wudang personalized health package and verify our model by the specific result analysis, the result indicates that our joint intervention mechanism is helpful to achieve the target and increase social welfare.

AB Background
   Achieving fair access to healthcare and improving population health are crucial in all settings. Properly staffed and fairly distributed primary health care (PHC) facilities are prerequisites to ensure accessible healthcare services. Nevertheless, availability and accessibility issues are common public health concerns, especially in under-resourced countries including Ethiopia. Measuring inequalities in accessibility of healthcare resources guide policy decisions to improve PHC services and ultimately achieving universal health coverage (UHC).
   Purpose
   To assess availability and measure magnitude and trend of inequalities in accessibility of health centre-based PHC resources in Ethiopia during 2015 to 2017.
   Methods
   We conducted a cross-sectional population-based analysis of district-level data collected from 16th December 2017 until 24th May 2018. Afar, Dire-Dawa, and Tigray regions were purposefully included in the study to represent the four pastoralist/semi-pastoralist, three urban and four agrarian regions in Ethiopia, respectively. We used ratios, different inequality indices and Gini decomposition techniques to characterise the inequalities.
   Results
   In 2017, median of health centres (HCs) per 15,000 inhabitants and their Gini indices (GIs) for Afar, Dire-Dawa, and Tigray were 0.781, 0.566, 0.591 vs. 0.237, 0.280, 0.216 respectively. Median overall skilled health workers (SHWs) per 10,000 inhabitants were 5.250, 7.539, and 6.246, respectively. These accounted for 11.80%, 16.94% and 14.04% of the WHO target of 44.5 to achieve SDGs. The corresponding GIs for the regions were 0.347, 0.186 and 0.175. Despite a higher overall SHWs inequality in the urban districts of Tigray (GI = 0.301), only Tigray showed significant inequality reductions in GHE (p < 0.001) and in all categories of SHWs (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions
   Our analysis provided a clear picture of availability and inequalities in PHC resources across three regions in Ethiopia. Identifying contributing factors to low densities and high inequalities of SHWs may help improve PHC services nationwide, along with pathway towards UHC.

AB BackgroundLarge-scale linkage of international clinical datasets could lead to unique insights into disease aetiology and facilitate treatment evaluation and drug development. Hereto, multi-stakeholder consortia are currently designing several disease-specific translational research platforms to enable international health data sharing. Despite the recent adoption of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the procedures for how to govern responsible data sharing in such projects are not at all spelled out yet. In search of a first, basic outline of an ethical governance framework, we set out to explore relevant ethical principles and norms.MethodsWe performed a systematic review of literature and ethical guidelines for principles and norms pertaining to data sharing for international health research.ResultsWe observed an abundance of principles and norms with considerable convergence at the aggregate level of four overarching themes: societal benefits and value; distribution of risks, benefits and burdens; respect for individuals and groups; and public trust and engagement. However, at the level of principles and norms we identified substantial variation in the phrasing and level of detail, the number and content of norms considered necessary to protect a principle, and the contextual approaches in which principles and norms are used.ConclusionsWhile providing some helpful leads for further work on a coherent governance framework for data sharing, the current collection of principles and norms prompts important questions about how to streamline terminology regarding de-identification and how to harmonise the identified principles and norms into a coherent governance framework that promotes data sharing while securing public trust.

   LIFE BALANCE; NIGHT; RISK; HEALTH; SLEEP; TIME
AB BackgroundOrganisation of working hour schedules in the Northern European countries are rather similar. EU countries are obliged to adopt national legislation regarding duration of weekly working hours and rest periods. Yet, working hour characteristics and schedules are likely to differ with respect to starting times and duration depending e.g. on culture and tradition. Yet, very little is known about potential differences between shifts and schedules across countries among nursing personel. This knowledge is relevant, since the potential differences in working hour characteristics may influence and possibly explain some of the differences observed in studies of health and safety.The aim of the study was to compare characteristics of working hours and work schedules among nursing personel in three Nordic countries: Denmark, Finland and Norway.MethodsThe study populations included nursing personnel holding a50% position at public hospitals in Denmark (n=63,678), Finland (n=18,257) or Norway (n=1538) in 2013. Objective payroll based registry data with information on daily starting and ending times were used to compare working hour characteristics e.g. starting time, duration of shift, and quick returns (<11h between two shifts), as well as work schedules e.g. permanent or 3-shift work between the three countries.ResultsNight shifts generally started earlier and lasted longer in Finland (10-11h starting at 20:00-22:59) than in Norway (10h starting at 21:00-21:59) and in Denmark (8h starting at 23:00-23:59). Very long shifts (12h) were more common in Denmark (12%) compared to Finland (8%) and Norway (3%). More employees had many (>13/year) quick returns in Norway (64%) and Finland (47%) compared to Denmark (16%). The frequency of 3-shift rotation workers was highest in Norway (41%) and lower in Denmark (22%) and Finland (22%). There were few differences across the countries in terms of early morning shifts and (very) long weekly working hours.ConclusionDespite similar distribution of operational hours among nurses in the three countries, there were differences in working hour characteristics and the use of different types of work schedules. The observed differences may affect health and safety.

AB Background: Cryptosporidium spp. are important zoonotic pathogens infecting a wide range of vertebrate hosts, and causing moderate to severe diarrhea in humans. Cryptosporidium infections are frequently reported in humans and animals worldwide, but little research has been done on local pig breeds such as Tibetan pigs and Yunan Black pigs and imported pig breeds such as Landrace pigs in China. Therefore, a total of 1089 pig fecal samples from four intensive farms in four areas of China, including Tibetan pigs from Gongbujiangda County (n = 180) and Mainling County (n = 434), Tibet, Yunan Black pigs from Sanmenxia, Henan Province (n = 246), and Landrace pigs from Kaifeng, Henan Province (n = 229), and were screened for the presence of Cryptosporidium with microscopy and nested PCR amplification of the small subunit rRNA gene.
   Results: The total infection rate of Cryptosporidium in 1089 fecal samples of three different pig breeds was 2.11% (23/1089), and the infection rates of Tibetan pigs, Yunan Black pigs, and Landrace pigs were 0.49% (3/614), 0.41% (1/246), and 8.30% (19/229), respectively. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection was significantly higher in weaned piglets (1-2 months) (4.36%, 21/482) than in younger and older age groups (p < 0.01). Sequence analysis of positive samples revealed that there was no mixed infection in our study population, which included 12 cases of C. suis mono-infections (52.17%, 12/23) and 11 cases of C. scrofarum mono-infections (47.83%, 11/23). C. suis was identified in one pre-weaned piglet (< 1 month) and 11 weaned piglets (1-2 months), while C. scrofarum was only detected in 10 weaned piglets (1-2 months) and one finished pig (> 2 months).
   Conclusions: This is the first report on the identification of Cryptosporidium spp. in Tibetan pigs, and our findings also elucidate the occurrence and distribution of Cryptosporidium in three different pig breeds in Tibet and Henan, China. More molecular epidemiological studies are required to better clarify the prevalence and public health significance of Cryptosporidium in different pigs.

AB Background: Rare diseases are a global public health priority. Though each disease is rare, when taken together the thousands of known rare diseases cause significant morbidity and mortality, impact quality of life, and confer a social and economic burden on families and communities. These conditions are, by their nature, encountered very infrequently by individual clinicians, who may feel unprepared to address their diagnosis and treatment. Clinical practice guidelines are necessary to support clinical and policy decisions. However, creating guidelines for rare diseases presents specific challenges, including a paucity of high certainty evidence to inform panel recommendations.
   Methods: This paper draws from the authors' experience in the development of clinical practice guidelines for three rare diseases: hemophilia, sickle cell disease, and catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome.
   Results: We have summarized a number of strategies for eliciting and synthesizing evidence that are compatible with the rigorous, internationally accepted standards for guideline development set out by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. These strategies include: use of pre-existing and ad hoc qualitative research, use of systematic observation forms, use of registry data, and thoughtful use of indirect evidence. Their use in three real guideline development efforts, as well as their theoretical underpinnings, are discussed. Avenues for future research to improve clinical practice guideline creation for rare diseases - and any disease affected by a relative lack of evidence - are also identified.
   Conclusions: Rigorous clinical practice guidelines are needed to improve the care of the millions of people worldwide who suffer from rare diseases. Innovative evidence elicitation and synthesis methods will benefit not only the rare disease community, but also individuals with common diseases who have rare presentations, suffer rare complications, or require nascent therapies. Further refinement and improved uptake of these innovative methods should lead to higher quality clinical practice guidelines in rare diseases.

AB BackgroundIn contrast to our knowledge about the number of cancers attributed to smoking, the number of cancers attributed to alcohol is poorly understood by the public. We estimate the increase in absolute risk of cancer (number of casesper 1000) attributed to moderate levels of alcohol, and compare these to the absolute risk of cancer attributed to low levels of smoking, creating a cigarette-equivalent of population cancer harm'.MethodsAlcohol and tobacco attributable fractions were subtracted from lifetime general population risks of developing alcohol- and smoking-related cancers, to estimate the lifetime cancer risk in alcohol-abstaining non-smokers. This was multiplied by the relative risk of drinking ten units of alcohol or smoking ten cigarettes per week, and increasing levels of consumption.ResultsOne bottle of wine per week is associated with an increased absolute lifetime cancer risk for non-smokers of 1.0% (men) and 1.4% (women). The overall absolute increase in cancer risk for one bottle of wine per week equals that of five (men) or ten cigarettes per week (women). Gender differences result from levels of moderate drinking leading to a0.8% absolute risk of breast cancer in female non-smokers.ConclusionsOne bottle of wine per week is associated with an increased absolute lifetime risk of alcohol-related cancers in women, driven by breast cancer, equivalent to the increased absolute cancer risk associated with ten cigarettes per week. These findings can help communicate that moderate levels of drinking are an important public health risk for women. The risks for men, equivalent to five cigarettes per week, are also of note.

AB Background: In Canada, a majority of children and adults are insufficiently active for health gains, and about one in seven children and over 20% of adults are overweight or obese. Overweight and obesity are risk factors for many chronic diseases in both adults and children and can result in lower quality and quantity of life. Children whose parents are overweight or obese are more likely to become overweight themselves. Thus, parent/child interventions are important for reducing obesity and promoting long-term healthy weights among members of the family unit. Programs using Co-Active coaching have resulted in positive behaviour changes among adults with overweight/ obesity; however, little research has explored the effects of Co-Active coaching on parents, and the consequent impact on the family unit (i.e. all parents and children in the same household). This protocol paper provides a detailed methodological account of a coaching-based program targeting parent and child dyads, in hopes of enhancing health behaviours within the family unit.
   Methods: Using a randomized controlled trial design, the researchers aim to identify the impact of coaching plus education (intervention) compared to education only (control) on parents with overweight/obesity and their children (ages 2.5-10, of any weight). A total of 50 dyads are being recruited and randomly assigned using a 1:1 ratio into the control or intervention group. The control group receive 6 webinar-based education sessions focused on physical activity and nutrition. The intervention group receive the same education sessions and nine, 20-min telephone-based sessions with a certified coach. Coaching and health education sessions are conducted with the parent/guardian of the dyad. This paper provides a detailed methodological account of this program.
   Discussion: The expected findings from this research will advance coaching literature, research, and practice on this topic by determining whether coaching and education are more effective than education alone at producing behaviour changes among a family unit If proven effective, this approach may be applied more broadly through public health interventionists to parent and child populations in hopes of affecting change with both individuals and their families.

TI The setting of the rising sun? A recent comparative history of life
   expectancy trends in Japan and Australia
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CAUSE-SPECIFIC MORTALITY; CANCER-MORTALITY; DISEASE; TOBACCO
AB Introduction
   Adult male and female mortality declines in Japan have been slower than in most high-income countries since the early 1990s. This study compares Japan's recent life expectancy trends with the more favourable trends in Australia, measures the contribution of age groups and causes of death to differences in these trends, and places the findings in the context of the countries' risk factor transitions.
   Methods
   The study utilises data on deaths by age, sex and cause in Australia and Japan from 1950-2016 from the Global Burden of Disease Study. A decomposition method measures the contributions of various ages and causes to the male and female life expectancy gap and changes over four distinct phases during this period. Mortality differences by cohort are also assessed.
   Findings
   Japan's two-year male life expectancy advantage over Australia in the 1980s closed in the following 20 years. The trend was driven by ages 45-64 and then 65-79 years, and the cohort born in the late 1940s. Over half of Australia's gains were from declines in ischaemic heart disease (IHD) mortality, with lung cancer, chronic respiratory disease and self-harm also contributing substantially. Since 2011 the trend has reversed again, and in 2016 Japan had a slightly higher male life expectancy. The advantage in Japanese female life expectancy widened over the period to 2.3 years in 2016. The 2016 gap was mostly from differential mortality at ages 65 years and over from IHD, chronic respiratory disease and cancers.
   Conclusions
   The considerable gains in Australian male life expectancy from declining non-communicable disease mortality are attributable to a range of risk factors, including declining smoking 16 prevalence due to strong public health interventions. A recent reversal in life expectancy trends could continue because Japan has greater scope for further falls in smoking and far lower levels of obesity. Japan's substantial female life expectancy advantage however could diminish in future because it is primarily due to lower mortality at old ages.

TI Knowledge, attitudes, and practices of public secondary school teachers
   on Zika Virus Disease: A basis for the development of evidence-based
   Zika educational materials for schools in the Philippines
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB The Philippines is at risk in developing a Zika Virus (ZIKV) Disease Outbreak. One of the possible interventions is health education because students are potential health advocates and influencers to their communities through the knowledge transfers from their teachers. The competency of Filipino teachers on ZIKV Disease is yet to be described. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of public secondary school teachers on ZIKV Disease. A modified version of the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices Survey Tool on Zika Virus Disease from the World Health Organization-Pan American Health Organization (WHO-PAHO) was used to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of teachers of eight public secondary schools in five villages in Quezon City, Philippines. Out of the 609 respondents, 87.3% reported that their main source of information about ZIKV is tri-media, which includes television, print, and radio. Majority of the respondents mentioned that ZIKV is transmitted through a mosquito bite (80.3%). However, only half of the participants identified vector control as a preventive strategy. Moreover, only 54% admitted to have cleaned their water containers or water sources within the last week. Only a few identified mother-to-child (23%) and sexual intercourse (8%) as other means of transmission. Half (49.8%) of the respondents felt that it is possible to acquire ZIKV in their community, while 90% perceived that a private doctor (90%) or a public hospital (88%) can effectively treat the disease. Perceived stigma is high at 50%. This study showed there was good knowledge among teachers on vector transmission of ZIKV but poor knowledge on other aspects of the disease. Also, there was a low level of perceived susceptibility and severity ZIKV which can be explained by the absence of a personal encounter with a Zika patient and the low number of cases in the Philippines. Half of the respondents said that they cleaned the possible mosquito breeding sites within the last week, followed by those who cleaned their water source more than a week ago (19%). None of the socio-demographic characteristics is significantly associated with respondents' knowledge on Zika. Only income and location of residence were found to be significantly associated with attitudes towards Zika. These findings call for a comprehensive training program that includes development of teaching materials for public secondary school teachers on ZIKV Disease based from this study.

TI The effect of a change in co-payment on prescription drug demand in a
   National Health System: The case of 15 drug families by price elasticity
   of demand
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CARE UTILIZATION; FREE MEDICINES; IMPACT; EXPENDITURES; NUMBER
AB Objectives
   To test the heterogeneity of the effect of a change in pharmaceutical cost-sharing by therapeutic groups in a Spanish region.
   Methods
   Data: random sample (provided by the Canary Islands Health Service) of 40,471 people covered by the Spanish National Health System (SNHS) in the Canary Islands. The database includes individualised monthly-dispensed medications (prescribed by the SNHS) from one year before (August 2011) to one year after (June 2013) the Royal Decree Law 16/2012 (RDL 16/2012). Sample: two intervention groups (low-income pensioners and middle-income working population) and one control group (low-income working population). Empirical model: quasi-experimental difference-in-differences design to study the change in consumption (measured in number of monthly Defined Daily Dose (DDDs) per individual) among 13 therapeutic groups. The policy break indicator (three-level categorical variable) tested the existence of stockpiling between the reform's announcement and its implementation. We ran 16 linear regression models (general, by therapeutic groups and by comorbidities) that considered whether the exclusion of some drugs from public provision impacted on consumption more than the co-payment increase.
   Results
   General: Reduction (-13.04) in consumption after the reform's implementation, which was fully compensated by a previous increase (16.60 i.e., stockpiling) among low-income pensioners. The middle-income working population maintained its trend of increasing consumption. Therapeutic groups: Reductions in consumption after the reform's implementation among low-income pensioners in 7 of the 13 groups, which were fully compensated for by a previous increase (i.e., stockpiling) in 4 groups and partially compensated for in the remaining 3. The analysis without the excluded medicines provided fewer negative coefficients. Comorbidities: Reduction in consumption that was only slightly compensated for by a previous increase (i.e., stockpiling).
   Conclusions
   The negative impact of cost-sharing produced, among low-income pensioners, a risk of loss of adherence to treatments, which could deteriorate the health status of individuals, especially among pensioners within the most inelastic therapeutic groups (associated with chronic diseases) and patients with comorbidities (also, associated with chronic diseases). Notwithstanding the above, this risk was more related to the exclusion of some drugs from provision than to the cost-sharing increase.

TI Unemployment claims in Philadelphia one year after implementation of the
   sweetened beverage tax
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SODA TAXES; EXCISE TAX; VIEWPOINT; HEALTH; IMPACT
AB Objectives
   Possible adverse economic impacts of sweetened drink taxes are a key concern for numerous stakeholders. This study examined changes in unemployment benefit claims filings in Philadelphia compared to its neighboring counties two years prior to and 14 months post implementation of a 1.5 cents per ounce excise tax on sugar- and artificially-sweetened beverages.
   Methods
   Data were obtained from the Pennsylvania Department of Labor. Interrupted time series analysis was used to determine if there was a change in new monthly unemployment claims filings post-tax implementation in Philadelphia compared to surrounding counties in supermarkets, select potentially affected industries, and in total claims filings across all industries combined.
   Results
   Results showed there were no statistically significant changes to unemployment claims in Philadelphia compared to neighboring counties for supermarkets (beta = -9.45, 95% CI = -98.11, 79.22), soft drink manufacturers (beta = -0.13, 95% CI = -9.13, 8.88), across other potentially affected industries (beta = 9.16, 95% CI = -488.29, 506.60), or across all industries (beta = -445.85, 95% CI = -4272.39, 3380.68) following implementation of the beverage tax. Unemployment declined similarly in Philadelphia compared to surrounding counties.
   Conclusions
   Public reports of increased unemployment within the first year following the implementation of the Philadelphia beverage tax are not supported by this analysis. Future work should examine employment outcomes and include longer follow-up periods.

TI Male knowledge, attitude and practice and partner pregnancy among
   Chinese unmarried youth
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CONTRACEPTIVE KNOWLEDGE; SEXUAL DEBUT; UNIVERSITY; STUDENTS; RISK
AB Background
   Early pregnancy among unmarried youth is a serious public health challenge. Male youth's knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and its association with the risk of their sexual partners' pregnancy in China remains unexplored. This study investigates the KAP among Chinese unmarried male youth aged 15-24 years and identifies its association with partner pregnancy using nationally representative data from Survey of Youth Access to Reproductive Health in China (YARHC) in 2009.
   Methods
   Chi-square tests were applied to explore the prevalence of partner pregnancy by male youth's KAP of SRH and logistic regression were applied to identify the associations of partner pregnancy with knowledge, attitudes and practice among male youth.
   Results
   Among 2853 sexually experienced male youth, totally 597 unmarried male youth caused 852 partner pregnancies and the prevalence rate was 20.93%. Lacking the knowledge of contraception access (OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.44-0.99) was significantly associated with lower risk of causing partner pregnancy. Contraception discussion before (1.49, 1.04-2.11) or after first sexual intercourse (1.46, 1.11-1.93), not using valid contraception (1.29, 1.03-1.64) and male contraception decision-maker (1.79, 1.41-2.28) were significantly associated with higher risk of causing partner pregnancy.
   Conclusion
   Our results indicated that male youth's knowledge and behaviors of sexual and reproductive health were significantly associated with the risk of causing partner pregnancy, and highlighted the importance and need of sexual and reproductive programs targeting male for the prevention of unintended partner pregnancy in China.

DE Tuberculosis; Drug-resistance; Mutation; Kenya
ID PATTERNS
AB BackgroundTuberculosis (TB), an ancient scourge of humanity known for several thousands of years, is still a significant public health challenge in many countries today even though some progress has been made in recent years in controlling the disease. The study's aim was to determine the prevalence of mutations responsible for drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis among patients visiting selected health centers in Nairobi, Kenya.MethodsThe cross-sectional study involved 132TB positive patients visiting Mbagathi and Chandaria hospitals between September 2015 and August 2016. Sputum samples were collected from the participants and handled in a biosafety level 3 laboratory at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI). Samples were decontaminated using N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine (NALC) - Sodium Hydroxide (NALC-NaOH), stained using Zeihl-Neelsen (ZN), and cultured in Mycobacterium Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT). DNA extracted from cultured isolates using Genolyse technique was subjected to Multiplex PCR amplification and reverse hybridization for detection of drug resistance mutations on rpoB, katG, inhA, gyrA, gyrB, rrs and eis genes using Hain Genotype MTBDRplus and MTBDRsl.ResultsAll 132 (100%) patients included in the study were culture positive for M. tuberculosis. Among them, 72 (54%) were male while the remaining 60 (46%) were female. The mean age of the patients was 26.419.4 (SD) with a range of 18 to 60years. Overall, the prevalence of the resistance to first and second-line TB drugs was 1.5% (2/132). Resistance to isoniazid (INH) was observed in 1 of 132 patients (0.8%), as was multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), also at 0.8%. No resistance to fluoroquinolones (FQ) or kanamycin (KAN) was observed. The INH resistant strain had the katG mutations S315T, while mutations detected for the MDR-TB were katG S513T for INH, rpoB S531L for rifampicin (RIF) and rrs G1484T for cross-resistance to aminoglycosides/capreomycin (AG/CP).Conclusions Molecular analysis confirms transmission of the drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains. The data suggested that there is homogeneity when it comes to the type of drug resistance and mutation that occurs in the region. This calls for intensified drug resistance surveillance and drug adherence among patients infected with TB.

TI From intervention to interventional system: towards greater theorization
   in population health intervention research
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH

ID COMPLEX INTERVENTIONS; CONTEXT
AB BackgroundPopulation health intervention research raises major conceptual and methodological issues. These require us to clarify what an intervention is and how best to address it.This paper aims to clarify the concepts of intervention and context and to propose a way to consider their interactions in evaluation studies, especially by addressing the mechanisms and using the theory-driven evaluation methodology.Main textThis article synthesizes the notions of intervention and context. It suggests that we consider an interventional system, defined as a set of interrelated human and non-human contextual agents within spatial and temporal boundaries generating mechanistic configurations - mechanisms - which are prerequisites for change in health. The evaluation focal point is no longer the interventional ingredients taken separately from the context, but rather mechanisms that punctuate the process of change. It encourages a move towards theorization in evaluation designs, in order to analyze the interventional system more effectively. More particularly, it promotes theory-driven evaluation, either alone or combined with experimental designs.ConclusionConsidering the intervention system, hybridizing paradigms in a process of theorization within evaluation designs, including different scientific disciplines, practitioners and intervention beneficiaries, may allow researchers a better understanding of what is being investigated and enable them to design the most appropriate methods and modalities for characterizing the interventional system. Evaluation methodologies should therefore be repositioned in relation to one another with regard to a new definition of evidence, repositioning practitioners' expertise, qualitative paradigms and experimental questions in order to address the intervention system more profoundly.

   determinants of urban health
AB The African continent is predicted to be home to over half of the expected global population growth between 2015 and 2050, highlighting the importance of addressing population health in Africa for improving public health globally. By 2050, nearly 60% of the population of the continent is expected to be living in urban areas and 35-40% of children and adolescents globally are projected to be living in Africa. Urgent attention is therefore required to respond to this population growth - particularly in the context of an increasingly urban and young population. To this end, the Research Initiative for Cities Health and Equity in Africa (RICHE Africa) Network aims to support the development of evidence to inform policy and programming to improve urban health across the continent. This paper highlights the importance of action in the African continent for achieving global public health targets. Specifically, we argue that a focus on urban health in Africa is urgently required in order to support progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and other global and regional public health targets, including Universal Health Coverage (UHC), the new Urban Agenda, and the African Union's Agenda 2063. Action on urban public health in Africa is critical for achieving global public health targets. Four key research and training priorities for improving urban health in Africa, are outlined: (1) increase intersectoral urban health literacy; (2) apply a healthy urban governance and systems approach; (3) develop a participatory and collaborative urban health planning process; and, (4) produce a new generation of urban health scholars and practitioners. We argue that acting on key priorities in urban health is critical for improving health for all and ensuring that we leave no-one behind' when working to achieve these regional and global agendas to improve health and wellbeing.

AB Introduction
   Global efforts to end HIV by 2030 focus on reducing and eventually eliminating new infections in priority populations. Identifying these populations and characterizing their vulnerability factors helps in guiding investment of scarce HIV prevention resources to achieve maximum impact. We sought to establish HIV prevalence, spatial distribution and risk factors for HIV infection in the Kenyan fishing communities of Lake Victoria.
   Methods
   We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 2637 people from all the 308 fish-landing beaches on the Kenyan shore of Lake Victoria. The number of participants enrolled at each beach were weighted based on the size of the beach, determined by the number of functional registered boats. We used simple random sampling to select those to be approached for study participation. Consenting participants were privately interviewed about their socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and sexual behavior, and were invited for HIV test using the Kenya rapid HIV testing protocol. We used descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic and linear regression for analysis.
   Results
   We found high HIV prevalence of 32% with significant differences between men (29%) and women (38%). Among men, having an HIV negative sexual partner, being circumcised, increasing number of condom protected sex acts in the preceding month, being younger and being a resident of Homa Bay, Kisumu, Siaya and Busia counties compared to Migori County reduced the risk of HIV infection. For women, being married, having more children with the current spouse, having an HIV negative sexual partner and being a resident of Busia compared to Migori County reduced the risk of HIV infection. We also found that longer distance from the beaches to the nearest public health facilities was associated with increasing cumulative HIV prevalence at the beaches.
   Conclusion
   Fishing communities have high HIV prevalence and may greatly benefit from interventions such as wider ART coverage, couple HIV risk reduction counseling, PrEP use for HIV negative partner at substantial continuous risk, alongside other HIV prevention services that the Kenyan government is currently rolling out. This will additionally require adequate plans to synchronize the provision of these services with the population's routine schedules for all these options to be reasonably accessible to them.

DE Benzathine penicillin G; Syphilis; Availability; China
ID PREGNANCY
AB BackgroundThe shortage of benzathine penicillin G (BPG) worldwide presents a major challenge in the treatment of syphilis. Its availability for syphilis treatment has not been adequately evaluated in China.MethodsTwo surveys were conducted among hospitals providing sexually transmitted infection clinical services in Shandong Province in 2012 and 2018. Data on the basic information and BPG availability of the surveyed hospitals and related factors were collected and analyzed using SPSS 17.0.ResultsA total of 433 and 515 hospitals were surveyed in 2012 and 2018, respectively. A significant difference in BPG availability was observed among different levels and types of hospitals both in 2012 (X-2=9.747, p=0.008; X-2=37.167, p=0.000) and 2018 (X-2=11.775, p=0.003; X-2=28.331, p=0.000). The BPG availability among surveyed hospitals increased from 45.0% in 2012 to 56.4% in 2018 (X-2=11.131, p=0.001). The BPG availability was higher in 2018 than in 2012 among county-level hospitals (52.0% vs. 40.8%, X-2=7.783, p=0.005), general western medicine hospitals (62.1% vs. 50.0%, X-2=6.742, p=0.009), maternal and child health hospitals (57.1% vs. 26.9%, X-2=13.906, p=0.000), and public hospitals (56.8% vs. 45.0%, X-2=11.361, p=0.001). However, the county-level availability of BPG (at least one hospital has BPG in a county-level unit) has not improved between 2012 and 2018 (65.93% vs. 70.34%; X-2=0.563, p=0.453). The absences of clinical needs, restriction of clinical antibacterial drugs, and lack of qualifications for providing syphilis treatment were the major reasons for the low BPG availability of hospitals.ConclusionsBPG availability for syphilis treatment in Shandong Province remains low and presents disparities among different levels and types of hospitals, although it has been improved in recent years. The low availability of BPG for syphilis treatment in China is related to its clinical use by doctors rather than the market supply. Health care reforms should further improve the availability and accessibility of health services.

ID 25-HYDROXYVITAMIN D; D INSUFFICIENCY; POPULATION; PREVALENCE; RISK; AGE
AB Background: Vitamin D deficiency has become an important public health problem, however few studies have been conducted in subtropical countries, and the predictors of vitamin D deficiency in people with healthy renal function are unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and factors associated with vitamin D deficiency in northern Taiwan.
   Methods: The cross-sectional study was performed between August 2013 and August 2017, and included 3954 participants without chronic kidney disease (CKD) aged >= 30 years in northern Taiwan. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)-D] levels, biochemistry, sociodemographic variables (age, sex, education, occupation) and lifestyle habits (tea, coffee consumption and physical activities) were recorded. Associations between vitamin D status and these variables were examined using a regression model. The definition of deficiency was defined as a serum 25(OH)-D level < 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L).
   Results: The mean 25(OH)-D concentration was 28.9 ng/mL, and 22.4% of the study population had vitamin D deficiency. There was a significantly higher vitamin D deficiency ratio in the women compared to the men (22.9% vs 9.9%, p < 0.001). Vitamin D deficiency was most prevalent (38.4%) in those aged 30-39 years. Those with a graduate degree had the highest rate of vitamin D deficiency (31.5%). The predictors of vitamin D deficiency included female sex, young age, high education level, living in an urban area and physical inactivity. Tea consumption was negatively associated with vitamin D deficiency.
   Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in subtropical areas such as northern Taiwan in healthy individuals without CKD.

AB Background: Chronic homelessness is a problem characterised by longstanding inability to attain or maintain secure accommodation. Longitudinal research with homeless populations is challenging, and randomised controlled trials that evaluate the effectiveness of intensive, case management interventions aimed at improving housing and health-related outcomes for chronically homelessness people are scant. More research is needed to inform programmatic design and policy frameworks in this area. This study protocol details an evaluation of the Journey to Social Inclusion - Phase 2 program, an intervention designed to reduce homelessness and improve outcomes in chronically homeless adults.
   Methods/design: J2SI Phase 2 is a three-year, mixed methods, multi-site, RCT that enrolled 186 participants aged 25 to 50 years between 07 January 2016 and 30 September 2016 in Melbourne. The intervention group (n = 90 recruited) receives the J2SI Phase 2 program, a trauma-informed intervention that integrates intensive case management and service coordination; transition to housing and support to sustain tenancy; and support to build social connections, obtain employment and foster independence. The comparison group (n = 96 recruited) receives standard service provision. Prior to randomisation, participants completed a baseline survey. Follow-up surveys will be completed every six months for three years (six in total). In addition to self-report data on history of homelessness and housing, physical and mental health, substance use, quality of life, social connectedness and public service utilisation, linked administrative data on participants' public services utilisation (e.g., hospitalisation, justice system) will be obtained for the three-year period pre- and post-randomisation. Semi-structured, qualitative interviews will be conducted with a randomly selected subset of participants and service providers at three time-points to explore changes in key outcome variables and to examine individual experiences with the intervention and standard service provision. An economic evaluation of the intervention and associated costs will also be undertaken.
   Discussion: Results of this trial will provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of J2SI Phase 2 compared to standard service provision. If the intervention demonstrates effectiveness in improving housing, health, quality-of-life, and other social outcomes, it may be considered for broader national and international dissemination to improve outcomes among chronically homeless adults.

AB Background: China is experiencing a sizeable rural-urban flow, which may influence the health of internal migrant youth deeply. Disadvantages in the city are highly likely to contribute to health issues among the young internal migrant population. The current qualitative study is to explore how internal migrant young people view the health issues they face, and the services and opportunities they could seek in their host community.
   Methods: Data were collected from 90 internal migrant youth aged between 15 and 19 years old and 20 adult service providers who worked with them in a community of Shanghai, where the population of internal migrants was relatively large. Four types of qualitative research methods were used, including key informant interviews with adults, in-depth interviews with adolescents, a photovoice activity with adolescents and community mapping & focus group discussions with adolescents. Guided by the ecological systems framework and the acculturation theory, thematic analysis was conducted using ATLAS.Ti 7.0 software.
   Results: While younger migrants had a limited understanding of health, elder migrant youths were more sensitive to societal and political factors related to their health. Mental health and health risk behaviors such as smoking, violence and premarital unsafe sex were thought as major health issues. Internal migrant youths rarely seek health information and services initiatively from formal sources. They believed their health concerns weren't as pressing as the pressure coming from the high cost of living, the experience of being unfairly treated and the lack of opportunities. Participants also cited lack of family and social support, lack of awareness and supportive policies to get access to community and public services as impacting health factors.
   Conclusions: The study's findings provide the insight to the social contexts which influence the health experience, health seeking behaviors, and city adaptation of young internal migrants in their host community. This research stresses the importance of understanding social networks and structural barriers faced by migrant youth in vulnerable environments. A multidimensional social support is essential for internal migrant youth facing present and potential health risks.

TI Quality of life and burnout among faculty members: How much does the
   field of knowledge matter?
SO PLOS ONE
LA English

AB Background
   Faculty members face demands such as research, outreach programs, and management activities. Such demands may expose faculty to burnout. Burnout affects the physical, psychological and social health of faculty members, but it is still unclear how it affects their quality of life. We aimed to assess the impact of burnout on the quality of life (QoL) of faculty members from different fields of knowledge.
   Methods
   Cross-sectional study using validated tools for measuring burnout and QoL (Oldenburg Burnout Inventory-OLBI and World Health Organization Quality of Life-Abbreviated version-WHOQOL-Bref) in a sample of 366 faculty members from a public university. Scores were analyzed using Student's t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), binary logistic regression, and structural equation modeling (SEM).
   Results
   More than a third of the faculty members (n = 127; 36.6%) suffered from burnout. Men had higher scores of quality of life than women in the physical health (p = 0.001; d<0.5), psychological (p = 0.001; d<0.5) and social relationships (p = 0.048; d<0.5) domains. Women were more exhausted than men (p = 0.001; d<0.5). Faculty members' perception of quality of life and burnout did not differ according to their field of knowledge (p> 0.05). Participants who felt tired before arriving at work were less likely to report good quality of life (OR = 0.46; 95% CI = 0.21-0.99). Faculty members who stated they needed more time to relax after work were less likely to be satisfied with their health (OR = 0.20; 95% CI = 0.10-0.40). Burnout showed a negative association with quality of life (lambda = 0.87; p <0,001; df = 8).
   Conclusions
   Burnout negatively affects faculty members' quality of life, regardless of their field of knowledge. Our results suggest the implementation of programs and actions to prevent burnout to faculty members, especially to women, as their quality of life may affect the quality of the education provided.

AB Brucellosis is a major public health problem still prevalent as a neglected endemic zoonosis requiring proactive attention in many communities worldwide. The present study involved analysis of Brucella field strains submitted for typing to the Italian National Reference Laboratory for Brucellosis from 2007 to 2015. Strains were identified at the species and biovar levels by classic and molecular techniques according to the World Organisation for Animal Health Manual. In total, 5,784 strains were typed: 3,089 Brucella abortus (53.4%), 2,497 B. melitensis (43.2%), 10 B. ovis (0.2%), 181 B. suis (3.1%), and 7 B. ceti (0.1%). The 2,981 strains from cattle were typed as B. abortus biovars 1, 3, and 6 (90.1%) and B. melitensis biovar 3 (9.9%). The 318 strains from water buffalo were typed as B. abortus biovars 1, 3 (95.9%) and B. melitensis biovar 3 (4.1%). The 2,279 strains from sheep and goats were typed as B. abortus biovars 1 and 3 (4.3%); B. melitensis biovars 1, 3, (95.3%); and B. ovis (0.4%). The 173 strains from wild boar were typed as B. suis biovar 2 (98.3%) and B. melitensis biovar 3 (1.7%). The 11 strains from pigs were typed as B. suis biovar 2. The 13 strains from humans were typed as B. melitensis biovar 3. The two strains from horses were typed as B. abortus biovar 1, while the seven strains from dolphins were typed as B. ceti. This additional knowledge on the epidemiology of brucellosis in Italy may be useful to formulate policies and strategies for the control and eradication of the disease in animal populations. The animal species affected, biovars typed, geographical origins, and spatial distributions of isolates are herein analyzed and discussed.

AB BackgroundHypertriglyceridemia is strongly associated with the risks of cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, and metabolic syndrome. The relationship between hypertriglyceridemia or high triglyceride levels and bone mineral density remains controversial. Furthermore, to date, no study has simultaneously examined the association among hypertriglyceridemia, bone area, bone mineral content, bone mineral density, body fat mass, and anthropometrics. The present study aimed to evaluate the association among hypertriglyceridemia, anthropometrics and various bone density and body fat composition variables to identify the best indicator of hypertriglyceridemia in a Korean population.MethodsThe data were obtained from the fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In total, 3918 subjects aged 20-80years participated in this study. In the variable analysis of the waist circumference (WC), trunk fat mass (Trk-Ft), body mass index, etc., a binary logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the significance of the differences between the normal group and hypertriglyceridemia groups.ResultsIn both men and women, the WC showed the strongest association with hypertriglyceridemia in the crude analysis (odds ratio (OR)=1.738 [confidence interval=1.529-1.976] and OR=2.075 [1.797-2.397]), but the Trk-Ft was the most strongly associated with the disease after adjusting for age and body mass index (adjusted OR=1.565 [1.262-1.941] and adjusted OR=1.730 [1.291-2.319]). In particular, the Pelvis area (Plv-A) was the most significant among the bone variables in women (adjusted OR=0.641 [0.515-0.796]). In the predictive power analysis, the best indicator of hypertriglyceridemia was WC in women (the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)=0.718 [0.685-0.751]) and Trk-Ft in men (AUC=0.672 [0.643-0.702]). The WC was also the most predictive among the anthropometric variables in men (AUC=0.670 [0.641-0.700]). The strength of the association and predictive power was stronger in women than in men.ConclusionsThe WC in women and Trk-Ft in men exhibited the best predictive power for hypertriglyceridemia. Our findings support the use of basic information for the identification of hypertriglyceridemia or high triglyceride levels in initial health screening efforts.

AB BackgroundWorldwide community pharmacies are shifting their role in the healthcare system from simple medication dispensers to health care providers. High levels of satisfaction with pharmacy services were found in previous studies. This study has two main goals. The primary goal is to describe the levels of satisfaction and knowledge regarding pharmacy services in Portugal. The secondary goal is to explore the perceptions and the utilisation of pharmacy services by the Portuguese. This statement includes exploring the impact of a set of variables on both perceptions and uses of pharmacies in regard to services that are currently offered as well as to new services that may be provided in the future.MethodsA face-to-face survey of closed-ended questions was applied to a nationwide representative sample of the Portuguese population in September 2015. The sample was weighted based on population distribution across regions, habitat, age and gender. Data analysis comprises descriptive statistics and Multiple Correspondence Analysis to explore different typologies of respondent's orientation toward community pharmacy.ResultsA total of 1114 interviews comprised the study. Of the respondents, 36% used the pharmacy as a first resource when seeking to treat a minor ailment, and 54% reported that they use the pharmacy as a first resource when seeking answers about medicines. Of those who visited their pharmacy at least once in the previous year, 94% were either globally satisfied or very satisfied. The level of acknowledgement of pharmacy services' was also high among the Portuguese. Of the participants, 29% considered there could be more services available in pharmacies that are currently provided by other health care facilities. The construction of a typology of orientations towards community pharmacy practice resulted in three outcome groups: Motivated (63%), those with a connection to a pharmacy; Settled (23%), mainly those who had a pharmacy nearby; and Demobilised (14%), those who are weakly tied to a pharmacy.ConclusionsThe vast majority of the Portuguese population has a strong positive attitude towards their community pharmacy, as expressed by the high levels of satisfaction with, and positive evaluation of, the pharmacy's services.

AB BackgroundFamily-centered care (FCC), based on collaborative participation of the family along with a team of health care providers, is found to increase the well-being of sick infants in neonatal critical care units. Over the last 4 years, the neonatal unit of Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in Delhi has innovated and developed an implementation framework for FCC. This qualitative study assessed the acceptability of family-centered care among providers and family members of neonates to identify gaps and challenges in implementation.MethodsIn-depth interviews were conducted among a purposive sample of twelve family members of admitted neonates and six providers to examine their perceptions and experiences regarding FCC.ResultsFamily members and providers expressed a positive perception and acceptance of FCC based on the competencies and knowledge acquired by parents and other caregivers of essential newborn care. Family members reported being satisfied with the overall health care experience due to the transparency of care and allowing them to be by their baby's bedside. Limitations in the infrastructure or lack of facilities at the public hospital did not seem to dilute these positive perceptions. Providers also perceived FCC as a good practice to be continued in spite of concerns around sharing of nursery space with parents, the need for constant vigilance of parents' practices in handling of their newborns, and the need for separate, designated nursing staff for FCC.ConclusionBoth providers and receivers of neonatal care found FCC to be an acceptable form of care. Providers identified challenges and suggested possible solutions, such as need of periodic provider sensitization on FCC, improved staff organization, and provision of mother-friendly facilities to enable her to provide around-the-clock care by her baby's bedside. Overcoming these challenges would allow for better integration of FCC within general clinical care in neonatal care units.

AB Antimicrobial resistance represents one of the world's most pressing public health problems. Governments around the world have-and will continue to-develop policy proposals to deal with this problem. However, the capacity of government will be constrained by very low levels of trust in government. This stands in contrast to 'medical scientists' who are highly trusted by the public. This article tests to what extent trusted sources can alter attitudes towards a policy proposal to regulate the use of antibiotics. We find that respondents are much more likely to support a policy put forward by 'medical scientists.' This article provides some initial evidence that medical scientists could be used to gain support for policies to tackle pressing policy challenges such as AMR.

TI Effect of nutrition education on hemoglobin level in pregnant women: A
   quasi-experimental study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID INTERVENTION; WEIGHT
AB Background
   Anemia during pregnancy is a major public health problem globally with multiple causes including inadequate dietary intakes. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of nutrition education on nutritional knowledge, hemoglobin level and dietary intake of anemic pregnant women.
   Materials and methods
   A quasi-experimental study was conducted among 115 mild to moderately anemic pregnant women attending ante natal clinics. Pregnant women were consecutively enrolled and assigned to receive nutrition education and diet plan in intervention group (n = 58) and general education only in control group (n = 57). The nutrition education was given to pregnant women on individual basis at the time of enrollment and follow-ups were done through biweekly phone calls and every 4 weeks during ANC visits. Baseline data were collected using semi-structure questionnaire for interview and hemoglobin level was also measured. Data were collected after 10 weeks of nutrition education intervention. Independent sample t-test was used to compare differences between the two groups.
   Results
   Out of 115 pregnant women enrolled, 107 completed the study (Intervention: 53; Control: 54). At the end of the nutrition education intervention and iron rich food based diet plan, the change in hemoglobin level was significantly high in the intervention over control group [0.56 +/- 0.40gm/dl vs. 0.16 +/- 0.82gm/dl, p = 0.002]. The change in the maternal nutritional knowledge score on anemia and iron rich foods was significantly high in the intervention over control group [8.26 +/- 4.57 vs. 1.05 +/- 6.59, p<0.001]. Consumption of iron rich food was significantly high in the intervention group (P<0.05).
   Conclusion
   Provision of nutrition education and iron rich food based diet plan was significantly associated with improved hemoglobin levels, improved dietary intake and nutritional knowledge on anemia and iron rich foods.

ID MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; SAUDI-ARABIA; EXCHANGE; NURSES
AB BackgroundKnowledge transfer of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) involves the dissemination of created/acquired information on MERS-CoV in hospitals, making this information accessible to all healthcare workers (HCWs). This study evaluated the perceived effectiveness of MERS-CoV educational programs and knowledge transfer among primary care HCWs at a hospital in Saudi Arabia that witnessed the largest outbreak of confirmed MERS-CoV cases in this country.MethodsA survey was distributed among primary care HCWs at five clinics in Saudi Arabia in 2016. Those with non-direct patient care responsibilities were excluded. Their knowledge was evaluated against facts published by Mayo Clinic Foundation, and its percentage mean score (PMS)standard deviation was calculated. HCWs' perceived effectiveness of educational programs and knowledge transfer was classified as negative or positive.ResultsSample comprised of 404 HCWs, of which 64% were females and 36% were males. Almost 26% were30years old, and 42% had >10years of work experience. Almost 46.5% were nurses, 23.0% physicians, 18.1% were pharmacists, and 12.4% were technical staff. PMS for knowledge was 71.1 +/- 19.4. The prevalence of negative perceptions towards educational programs was 22.5% and of knowledge transfer was 20.8%. Older(>40years of age) and more experienced(>10years) HCWs had the highest PMS for knowledge(73.4 +/- 18.9,P=0.005 and 76.9 +/- 15.7,P<0.001 respectively). Negative perceptions of educational programs (49.4 +/- 20.7; P<0.001) and knowledge transfer (46.0 +/- 19.7; P=0.001) were associated with a lower knowledge PMS. Males were 2.4[95% confidence interval 1.4-4.2] times and 2.0[1.1-3.5] times more likely to have negative perceptions of educational programs and knowledge transfer (adjusted (adj.)P=0.001 and adj. P=0.023, respectively). Physicians/pharmacists were 1.8[1.03-3.11] and 2.8[1.6-5.0] times more likely to have negative perceptions of both outcomes (adj. P=0.038 and adj. P=0.001, respectively). Less experienced HCWs were 2.1[1.3-3.5] times and 4.9[2.6-9.2] times more likely to exhibit negative perceptions of the two outcomes (adj. P<0.001 each).ConclusionsA negative perception of the effectiveness of MERS-CoV knowledge transfer was associated with poorer knowledge and was more prevalent among male HCWs, physicians/pharmacists and less experienced HCWs. Hospitals should always refer to efficient knowledge sharing and educational strategies that render beneficial outcomes to patients, HCWs, and the public community.

AB BackgroundThe goal of this research is to create a system that can use the available relevant information about the factors responsible for the spread of dengue and; use it to predict the occurrence of dengue within a geographical region, so that public health experts can prepare for, manage and control the epidemic. Our study presents new geospatial insights into our understanding and management of health, disease and health-care systems.MethodsWe present a machine learning-based methodology capable of providing forecast estimates of dengue prediction in each of the fifty districts of Thailand by leveraging data from multiple data sources. Using a set of prediction variables, we show an increase in prediction accuracy of the model with an optimal combination of predictors which include: meteorological data, clinical data, lag variables of disease surveillance, socioeconomic data and the data encoding spatial dependence on dengue transmission. We use Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to fit the relationships between the predictors (with a lag of one month) and the clinical data of Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) using the data from 2008 to 2012. Using the data from 2013 to 2015 and a comparative set of prediction models, we evaluate the predictive ability of the fitted models according to RMSE and SRMSE as well as using adjusted R-squared value, deviance explained and change in AIC.ResultsThe model allows for combining different predictors to make forecasts with a lead time of one month and also describe the statistical significance of the variables used to characterize the forecast. The discriminating ability of the final model was evaluated against Bangkok specific constant threshold and WHO moving threshold of the epidemic in terms of specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV).ConclusionsThe out-of-sample validation showed poorer results than the in-sample validation, however it demonstrated ability in detecting outbreaks up-to one month ahead. We also determine that for the predicting dengue outbreaks within a district, the influence of dengue incidences and socioeconomic data from the surrounding districts is statistically significant. This validates the influence of movement patterns of people and spatial heterogeneity of human activities on the spread of the epidemic.

AB BackgroundComplementary Medicine (CM) continues to thrive across many countries. Closely related to the continuing popularity of CM has been an increased number of enrolments at CM education institutions across the public and private tertiary sectors. Despite the popularity of CM across the globe and growth in CM education/education providers, to date, there has been no critical review of peer-reviewed research examining CM education undertaken. In direct response to this important gap, this paper reports the first critical review of contemporary literature examining CM education research.MethodsA review was undertaken of research to identify empirical research papers reporting on CM education published between 2005 and 17. The search was conducted in May 2017 and included the search of PubMed and EBSCO (CINAHL, MEDLINE, AMED) for search terms embracing CM and education. Identified studies were evaluated using the STROBE, SRQP and MMAT appraisal tools.ResultsFrom 9496 identified papers, 18 met the review inclusion criteria (English language, original empirical research data, reporting on the prevalence or nature of the education of CM practitioners), and highlighted four broad issues: CM education provision; the development of educational competencies to develop clinical skills and standards; the application of new educational theory, methods and technology in CM; and future challenges facing CM education. This critical integrative review highlights two key issues of interest and significance for CM educational institutions, CM regulators and researchers, and points to number of significant gaps in this area of research. There is very sporadic coverage of research in CM education. The clear absence of the robust and mature research regarding educational technology and e-learning taking place in medical and or allied health education research is notably absent within CM educational research.ConclusionDespite the high levels of CM use in the community, and the thriving nature of CM educational institutions globally, the current evidence evaluating the procedures, effectiveness and outcomes of CM education remains limited on a number of fronts. There is an urgent need to establish a strategic research agenda around this important aspect of health care education with the overarching goal to ensure a well-educated and effective health care workforce.

AB BackgroundSolidago chilensis (syn. microglossa) is a plant from the Asteraceae family widely distributed in South America and used to treat inflammatory diseases. In 2009, it was listed as one of the native medicinal herbal plants used in the Brazilian public health system. In addition to its anti-inflammatory properties, a recent clinical study has shown antinociceptive effects of S. chilensis, introducing a new potential medical use for this plant. The aim of the present study was to investigate the antinociceptive activity of the hydroalcoholic extract of Solidago chilensis (HESc) in rodent models of pain.MethodsThe dried plant extract was obtained from its aerial parts, maintained in ethanol (100g/l) and filtered. Rats or mice were treated with intraperitoneal injections of HESc (3, 10 or 30mg/kg) 30min before being submitted to writhing, 0.2%-formaline or hot-plate tests or prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) administration in the hind paw. Mechanical hypernociception and motor impairment were evaluated by electronic von Frey and rota-rod, respectively.ResultsHESc dose-dependently inhibited abdominal contortions in the writhing test and attenuated phases I and II formalin-induced nociceptive behavior. Treatment with HESc also increased thermal threshold and decreased PGE(2)-induced hypernociception without promoting motor impairment.ConclusionsOur data suggest that, when systemically administered, HESc decreases nociception without inducing a sedative effect. Importantly, this effect was observed in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory models of pain and nociception, suggesting a specific non-inflammatory mechanism of HESc on pain. Our findings indicate that S. chilensis might be an important adjuvant in pain management.

AB BackgroundThis retrospective process evaluation reports on the application of a 1-year implementation program to increase identification and management of patients at high risk of a hereditary cancer syndrome. The project used the Theoretical Domains Framework Implementation (TDFI) approach, a promising implementation methodology, used successfully in the United Kingdom to address patient safety issues. This Australian project run at two large public hospitals aimed to increase referrals of patients flagged as being at risk of Lynch syndrome on the basis of a screening test to genetic services. At the end of the project, the pathologists' processes had changed, but the referral rate remained inconsistent and low.MethodsSemi-structured interviews explored participants' perceptions of the TDFI approach and Health services researchers wrote structured reflections. Interview transcripts and reflections were coded initially against implementation outcomes for the various TDFI approach activities: acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, value for time cost, and adoption. On a second pass, themes were coded around challenges to the approach.ResultsInterviews were held with nine key project participants including pathologists, oncologists, surgeons, genetic counsellors and an administrative officer. Two health services researchers wrote structured reflections. The first of two major themes was Theory-related challenges', with subthemes of accessibility of theory underpinning the TDFI, commitment to that theory-based approach, and the problem of complexity. The second theme was Practical challenges' with subthemes of stakeholder management, navigating the system, and perceptions of the problem.Health services researchers reflected on the benefits of bridging professional divides and facilitating collective learning and problem solving, but noted frustrations around clinicians' time constraints that led to sparse interactions with the team, and lack of authority to effect change themselves.ConclusionsMixed success of adoption as an outcome was attributed to the complexity and highly nuanced nature of the setting. This made identifying the target behaviour, a key step in the TDFI approach, challenging. Introduced changes in the screening process led to new, unexpected issues yet to be addressed. Strategies to address challenges are presented, including using an internal facilitator with a focus on applying a theory-based implementation approach.

TI Reasons given by pregnant women for participating in a clinical trial
   aimed at preventing premature delivery: a qualitative analysis
SO BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Pregnancy; Premature delivery; Clinical trial
ID DECISIONS; SATISFACTION
AB Background: In clinical trials, pregnant women are potentially vulnerable, and the fetus is exposed to the intervention. This study aimed to identify the reasons that led pregnant women at a high risk of premature delivery to participate in a randomized clinical trial.
   Methods: The women participating in the main trial were contacted by telephone postpartum and invited to answer an open questionnaire in a cross-sectional study. Data were collected by telephone and analyzed using thematic analysis. After the analysis categories were defined, all the answers were reviewed, categorized and grouped. A descriptive summary of the content of each category was then made.
   Results: Overall, 208 women from different geographical regions of the country agreed to participate. Four categories were identified: 1) The risk of losing the baby; 2) A previous experience of premature delivery; 3) The role of the doctor and other health professionals, and 4) The availability of quality medical care and free medication. The main reason given for agreeing to participate was to reduce the risks associated with the baby being born prematurely, particularly when the woman herself or someone close to her had already experienced premature delivery. Other reasons were having received clear guidance and explanations from the doctor regarding prematurity and about the study and being given the opportunity to receive free treatment with greater access to the public healthcare system.
   Conclusions: The decision to participate in a clinical trial is not easy, particularly when the individual is vulnerable and in a critical situation as in the case of a pregnant woman at a high risk of delivering prematurely. Fears and uncertainties regarding the pregnancy outcome, as well as the woman's previous experiences and her awareness of the actual risks she faces will affect her decision regarding whether or not to participate. Recruitment challenges could be overcome by ensuring that the research team provides adequate information and support, thus creating a bond with participants that would foster a sense of safety and trust in the study proposals.

TI Migrant health research in the Republic of Ireland: a scoping review
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Review
DE Immigrant; Health; Ireland; Scoping review; World health organization
ID EUROPE; POPULATION; MIGRATION; CARE
AB Background: Migration to European countries has increased in number and diversity in recent years. Factors such as access to healthcare, language barriers and legal status can impact the health outcomes of migrant groups. However, little is known about the evidence base on the health status of migrants in the Republic of Ireland. Our aim was to scope existing peer-reviewed research on the health of migrants in Ireland and identify any gaps in the evidence.
   Methods: We conducted a scoping review of peer-reviewed research on the health of migrants in the Republic of Ireland. Eleven electronic databases were searched for peer-reviewed, empirical articles published between 2001 and 2017. Search terms were adapted from a World Health Organisation review. Findings were analysed using the 2016 World Health Organisation Strategy and Action Plan for Refugee and Migrant Health in the World Health Organisation European region, which outlines nine strategic areas that require collaborative action.
   Results: Of 9396 articles retrieved, 80 met inclusion criteria, with the majority (81%) published since 2009. More than half of the studies had a quantitative design (65%). Migrants studied came from Eastern Europe, Asia and Africa and included labour migrants, refugees and asylum seekers. Most studies related to two World Health Organisation strategic areas; 4: "achieving public health preparedness and ensuring an effective response", and 5: "strengthening health systems and their resilience".
   Conclusion: There is growing attention to migrant health in Ireland with a balance of qualitative and quantitative research. While much of the identified research is relevant to three of the World Health Organisation strategic areas, there are significant gaps in the other six areas. The study design could be replicated in other countries to examine and inform migrant health research.

TI Epidemiologic profile of measles in Central African Republic: A nine
   year survey, 2007-2015
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ETHIOPIA; OUTBREAK
AB Introduction
   Measles remains a major public health problem in many developing countries in which vaccination coverage is poor, as is the case in the Central African Republic (CAR). At the beginning of the 2000s, a surveillance system was established in the country, and samples from suspected cases are regularly tested in the laboratory for serological confirmation. Since 2007, when case-by-case monitoring with standardized laboratory databases and monitoring, was set up, no assessment have been performed. Therfore, 9 years later it seemed appropriate to make a first assessment. The aim of the study reported here was to describe the epidemiology of measles in the CAR on the basis of surveillance and laboratory data.
   Method
   A descriptive retrospective study was conducted, based on the databases of the measles surveillance programme and of the Institut Pasteur laboratory in Bangui during the period 2007-2015.
   Results
   During this study period, the surveillance programme notified 3767 cases. Of these, 2795 (75%) were sent for laboratory confirmation, and 24.6% (687/2795) were confirmed serologically. Of the 1797 cases of measles declared during this period by the surveillance programme, 1110 (61.8%) were confirmed clinically or by epidemiological linkage. The majority of confirmed cases (83.7%; 575/687) occurred in children under 10 years, over half of whom (44.2%; 304/687) were aged 1-4 years. Epidemics occurred regularly between 2011 and 2015, with > 10% of laboratory-confirmed cases. The rate of laboratory investigation was < 80% between 2011 and 2013 but nearly 100% in the other years.
   Conclusion
   Measles remains a common, endemic illness in the CAR. Improved detection will require better measles surveillance, increased vaccination coverage, revision of the investigation forms to include the WHO case definition and training of the health personnel involved in case-finding in the field.

TI Cost-effectiveness of community-based gendered advisory services to
   farmers: Analysis in Mozambique and Tanzania
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT; SOCIAL NETWORKS; CONSERVATION; ADOPTION; LAND;
   DIFFUSION; KNOWLEDGE
AB Rigorous impact evaluations on agricultural interventions in the developing world have proliferated in research of recent years. Whereas increased care in causal identification in such analyses is beneficial and has improved the quality of research in this field, much of the literature still fails to investigate the costs needed to achieve any benefits identified. Such understanding, however, would be crucial for drawing policy and programmatic conclusions from the research and for informing the allocation of public investments. Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) subjects both the cost side and the effects side of agricultural and rural interventions to technical scrutiny and unifies both sides in order to compare the relative cost-effectiveness of different modalities of a programme, of efforts to reach different target groups, or of efforts to achieve different outcomes. CEAs, while present in the health and education sectors, remain rare in agricultural and rural development research. This study contributes to filling the knowledge gap by conducting CEAs in a particular type of programmatic work in the agricultural sector-namely, interventions conducted as field experiments that bring a gender lens to community-based advisory services in African rural areas. Specifically, we consider two such programmes-one in Mozambique in which such advisory services aim to improve sustainable land management (SLM) practices in agricultural production, and the other in Tanzania to advise farmers on their land rights. Using CEA methods combined with econometric analysis based on randomised controlled trials, we find that the gendered modality is consistently more cost-effective than the basic modality when considering varied outcomes and target groups. However, for any given modality, it is more cost-effective to improve outcomes for men than for women. The structure of costs in the agricultural extension programme further allowed for a simulation of how cost-effectiveness would change if the programme were scaled up geographically. The results show that expansion of the basic modality of the SLM programme leads to improvements in cost-effectiveness, while the gendered modality displays nonlinear changes in cost-effectiveness along the expansion path, first worsening with initial scale-up and subsequently improving with further expansion.

TI Illness perceptions in people with obsessive-compulsive disorder; A
   qualitative study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID DSM-IV; QUESTIONNAIRE; COMORBIDITY; INTERVIEW
AB Background
   Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a serious mental health problem that causes significant impairment and reduced quality of life. Though some substantially benefit from psychological therapies, a substantial proportion of people with OCD disengage from treatment or fail to benefit. Theoretical models such as the Common-Sense Model posit that our management of physical illness depends on our perceptions about the condition. Identifying how people with OCD perceive their condition could lead to important insight that would improve treatment of OCD.
   Objectives
   To identify and characterise the illness perceptions of people with OCD.
   Method
   Transcribed semi-structured interviews exploring the illness perceptions of 16 people with OCD were analysed using thematic analysis.
   Results
   In some cases, identification of symptoms was hindered by a failure to interpret experiences as 'symptoms'. Instead, these individuals interpreted symptoms as a personality quirk, or as evidence that they had become deviant. Perceptions of the condition as 'part' of the self contributed to views of OCD as permanent. Individuals were concerned about the impact of OCD on friends and family and attempted to minimise its consequences, for example by concealing symptoms from their children, who they feared could acquire OCD.
   Conclusion
   Applying a theoretical model of physical health understanding to OCD yielded novel insights, with important implications for support and treatment. To enable early help-seeking and rapid diagnosis, public and professional knowledge about OCD should be extended beyond 'washing and checking' to the less widely known OCD-subtypes, such as fear of causing harm. It may be important to identify and challenge views of OCD as permanent early in the course of treatment to maximise engagement. Management of OCD should also address the burden of living with OCD in a family context. Further research to test whether these perceptions lead to coping responses and outcomes in OCD is now needed.

AB Introduction
   Worldwide, there are between 50-67 million migrant domestic workers, the majority of whom are women. In many countries, provisions are not in place to protect female migrant domestic workers. These women may be at risk of occupational and social stressors, including exploitation and abuse, which may negatively impact on their quality of life, including psychological health. Research examining the occupational, social, and psychological needs of FMDWs from a public health perspective is critical to guide the development of policies which ensure wellbeing, prevent abuse, and align with international priorities to improve population health. Though there have been a number of high-profile incidents of exploitation and abuse, there has been limited research on the stressors experienced by these communities, their perceived impact, or coping mechanisms.
   Materials and methods
   Thematic analysis was used to analyse qualitative free-text written responses collected as part of a cross-sectional survey on the relationship between social and occupational stressors and the health and quality of life of FMDWs in Singapore. Responses correspond to open-ended questions in the qualitative component of the survey examining three domains: causes of stress, coping strategies, and what people can do to help with stress.
   Results
   Responses from 182 FMDWs were analysed. Key themes were identified around causes of stress (including 'work and agency', 'the pervasiveness of financial need', and 'family and obligation'), coping strategies, and social support. Each theme describes key factors which contribute to the occupational and social stressors experienced and reported by FMDWs.
   Discussion
   This research highlights the stressors FMDWs in Singapore experience, as well as key coping mechanisms. There is a clear need for policies which facilitate FMDWs' ability to utilise these coping resources, and which protect against coercive or exploitative employment conditions. Strategies are also needed to monitor and evaluate policies intended to protect FMDWs, and to strengthen the implementation of global frameworks targeted at improving workplace conditions and workers' rights.

AB There is limited evidence linking the impacts of reduced air pollution on hospital admissions. The potential biological mechanisms are still not completely understood. This study examined the effects of mitigated ambient pollution on hospital admissions and inflammatory biomarker levels in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) COPD patients. Daily hospital admissions were compared over 51 days associated with the Asian Games period (Nov 1-Dec 21, 2010) with the identical calendar dates of baseline years (2004-2009 and 2011-2013). A three-year cohort study was conducted with 36 COPD patient participants. The daily particulate matter (PM10) decreased from 65.86 mu g/m(3) during the baseline period to 62.63 mu g/m(3) during the Asian Games period; the daily NO2 level decreased from 51.33 mu g/m(3) to 42.63 mu g/m(3). Between the baseline period and the Asian Games, daily hospital admissions from non-accidental diseases decreased from 116 to 93, respectively; respiratory diseases decreased from 20 to 17, respectively; and cardiovascular diseases decreased from 11 to 9 during the Asian Games period, respectively. No statistically significant reductions were seen in the remaining months of 2010 in Guangzhou, during the the Asian Games period in the control city, and two other control diseases. Furthermore, we identified significant improvement in CRP and fibrinogen by -20.4% and -15.4% from a pre-Asian game period to a during-Asian game period, respectively. For CRP, we found significant increases in NO2 at lag1-3 days after-Asian game period and significant increases in PM10 at lag1-2 days. Similar effects were also seen with fibrinogen. This discovery provides support for efforts to diminish air pollution and improve public health through human air pollutants intervention. Improved air pollution during the 2010 Asian games was correlated with decreases in biomarkers associated with systemic inflammation in COPD patient participants.

AB BackgroundIntestinal parasites still pose major public health problems in developing countries like Ethiopia. Local epidemiological data is indispensable in order to design and monitor prevention and control strategies. Therefore the present study aimed to assess the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections and associated factors among students at Birbir town, Southern Ethiopia.MethodsA school-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March to May 2018. Three hundred fifty-one students, who were selected by stratified followed by systematic random sampling, participated in the study. Socio-demographic information was collected using a structured questionnaire. Anthropometric measurements of height and weight were taken at the time of interview. Stool samples were collected and processed by direct wet mount and formol-ether concentration techniques for microscopic detection of intestinal parasites. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 20.ResultsAmong 351 (180 male and 171 female) children participated, 135 (38.5%) and 216 (61.5%) were within the age groups of 5-9 and 10-14 respectively. Ninety five (27.1%; 95%CI: 22.2-31.9) of them were tested positive for intestinal parasites. Helminths and protozoa account 21.1 and 7.1% prevalences respectively. Seventy eight children were infected with a single parasite species while 17 were positive for double or triple infections. A. lumbricoides (31, 8.8%) was the most frequently detected parasite followed by T. trichiura (20, 5.7%) and hookworms (19, 5.4%). Age group of 10-14years (AOR=2.51; 95%CI: 1.41-4.45, p=0.002) and absence of hand washing habit after toilet (AOR=4.49; 95%CI: 2.00-10.1, p=0.001) were significantly associated with intestinal parasitic infection.ConclusionsThe prevalence of intestinal parasitic infection among school age children is still unacceptably high. Age group of 10-14year old and not having habit of hand washing after toilet were significantly associated with intestinal parasitic infection. The ongoing school based deworming should be strengthened and be integrated with school health programs.

DE Nosocomial infections; Educational module; Training course; Public
   hospitals; Nurses in Yemen
AB BackgroundNosocomial infections remain a global health problem and they are considered as one of the leading causes of increased morbidity and mortality. In-service training courses related to infection control measures can help nurses to make informed and therapeutic decisions which could prevent or reduce the incidence of nosocomial infections. This study protocol is of a hospital-based trial to develop, implement and evaluate an educational module on nosocomial infection control among nurses in public hospitals in Yemen. This study is currently ongoing and at the analysis stage.MethodsA three-arm single-blinded randomized community hospital-based trial was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a newly developed nosocomial infection control educational module among nurses in public hospitals in Yemen. To ensure effective delivery and acquisition of knowledge, the Situated Learning Theory was applied during the course of the intervention. A total of 540 Yemeni in-ward nurses, who had three years nursing diploma and at least a year of working experience in the selected public hospitals were recruited in this study. The hospitals were the unit of randomization whereby eight hospitals were assigned randomly to intervention and waitlist groups. Intervention group-1 (n=180) received an educational module supported by audio-video CD and a training course for eight weeks. Intervention group-2 (n=180) was given only the educational module with audio-video CD (without the training course). The waitlist group received no intervention during the period of data collection but they will be given the same training and learning materials after the completion of the study.DiscussionThis study contributes to the lack of a nosocomial infection control educational module for nurses in Yemen. It is hoped that the educational module will serve as an effective approach to increase the nurses' knowledge and improve their practices regarding nosocomial infection control measures and hence decrease the prevalence of nosocomial infections in the future.Trial registrationID: ISRCTN19992640, Date of registration: 20/6/2017. This study protocol was retrospectively registered.

AB Background
   Stroke is the third major cause of death in the world and the second in Brazil. The purpose of this work was to assess the stroke-related hospitalization, in-hospital mortality, and case fatality rates under the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) from 2009 to 2016.
   Methods
   We evaluated the hospital admissions for stroke and their associated outcomes using data from the Hospital Information available at the Informatics Department of SUS. We selected hospitalization registries according to stroke diagnosis codes from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). We identified the association of age and sex with patient death through multiple logistic regression and calculated the rates of hospitalization, mortality and case-fatality per 100,000 inhabitants using age-adjustment methodology.
   Results
   We analyzed 1,113,599 stroke hospitalizations. From 2009 to 2016, the number of admissions increased from 131,122 to 146,950 and the absolute number of in-hospital deaths increased from 28,731 to 31,937. Younger age and male sex were significantly associated with patient survival. Our results showed that the annual age-adjusted hospitalization and in-hospital mortality rates decreased by 11.8% and 12.6%, respectively, but the case fatality rate increased for patients older than 70 years.
   Conclusions
   Although the age-adjusted hospitalization and in-hospital mortality rates declined, the total number of hospitalization and deaths have increased. It is expected a continuous increase over the next years of stroke admissions with the rapid aging of the Brazilian population. Efforts should be renewed targeting risk factors, access to hospital and rehabilitation in particular for the elderly population.

AB With the expansion of the aged population, it is predicted that neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) will become a major threat to public health worldwide. However, existing therapies can control the symptoms of the diseases at best, rather than offering a fundamental cure. As for the complex pathogenesis, clinical and preclinical researches have indicated that oxidative stress, a central role in neuronal degeneration, is a possible therapeutic target in the development of novel remedies. In this study, the motor neuron-like cell line NSC-34 was employed as an experimental model in probing the effects induced by the combination of non-invasive low intensity pulsed electric field (LIPEF) and fucoidan on the H2O2-induced neuron damage. It was found that single treatment of the LIPEF could protect the NSC-34 cells from oxidative stress, and the protective effect was enhanced by combining the LIPEF and fucoidan. Notably, it was observed that single treatment of the LIPEF obviously suppressed the H2O2-enhanced expression of ROCK protein and increased the phosphorylation of Akt in the H2O2-treated NSC-34 cells. Moreover, the LIPEF can be easily modified to concentrate on a specific area. Accordingly, this technique can be used as an advanced remedy for ROCK inhibition without the drawback of drug metabolism. Therefore, we suggest the LIPEF would be a promising strategy as a treatment for motor neurodegeneration and warrant further probe into its potential in treating other neuronal degenerations.

AB Background: Puerperal sepsis is an infection of the genital tract, which occurs from rupture of amniotic sacs and within 42nd day after delivery. It happens mainly after discharge in the 1st 24 h of parturition. It is the third leading cause of direct maternal mortality in developing nations. It is also among preventable conditions. Even though multiple interventions were done to overcome these health problems, maternal mortality and morbidities were still significant. Mainly, in Ethiopia lack of clearly identified causes of maternal mortality and morbidity makes the problem unsolved.
   Methods: Case-control study was conducted at public Hospitals in west shoa zone Oromia regional state, Ethiopia from February 01 to April 30/2018.women with puerperal sepsis (n = 67) were selected by convenience method. Controls (n = 213) were selected by systematic random sampling. Controls to cases ratio was 3:1 and structured questionnaire was used to interviewafter verbal consent was obtained. Data was entered in to epi -info 7.2 then exported to SPSS version 20.0 for analysis. A logistic regression model was used for data analysis. Those variables which have p-value <0.05 were accepted that they are independent determinants of puerperal sepsis.
   Result: Rural residence (AOR [95%CI] = 2.5(1.029-6.054), Mothers with no formal education (AOR [95%CI] = 6.74([1.210-37.541]), up to primary level of education(AOR [95%CI] = 6.72(1.323-34.086), total monthly income of the mother or family < = 500 ETB and 501-1500 ETB(AOR [95%CI] = 5.94(1.471-23.93) and (AOR [95%CI] = 6.57 (1.338-32.265) respectively, Mothers having 1-2 times antenatal care(ANC)visit (AOR [95%CI] = 6.57([1.338-32.265]), Duration of Labor12-24 h (AOR [95%CI] = 3.12 (1.805-12.115), > = 25 h (AOR [95%CI] = 4.71([1.257-17.687]),vaginal examinations > = 5times (AOR [95%CI] = 4.00([1.330-12.029]), Delivery by C/S (AOR [95%CI] = 3.85 ([1.425-10.413]), Rupture of membrane >24 h (AOR [95%CI] = 3.73([1.365-10.208]) and those Referred from other health institutions (AOR [95%CI] = 2.53([1.087-5.884], were independent determinants of puerperal sepsis in this study.
   Conclusion: Majority of determinants of puerperal sepsis were related with pregnancy and childbirth. Therefore, to tackle a problem of puerperal sepsis all concerning bodies should take measures during prenatal, natal and postnatal period.

AB Background: The implementation of an integrated molecular surveillance (IMS) of tuberculosis (TB) is of high priority for TB control. IMS is defined as the systematic inclusion of molecular typing results in the national TB surveillance system. Although not standardized, an IMS of TB is already implemented in several low TB incidence countries. Germany is in the process of implementing a nationwide IMS of TB. This requires close collaboration between national and local health authorities. We conducted an online survey to understand the current use of molecular typing results for TB surveillance among the local public health offices (PHO)s in Germany, and to collect their perception and expectations towards the implementation of a nationwide IMS of TB.
   Methods: The online survey was developed using the software Voxco and included 31 questions. The survey was sent to all the 377 local PHOs in Germany in April 2017. Responses were collected until June 2017.
   Results: A total of 174/377 (46.2%) local PHOs participated in our survey, and 88/377 (23.3%) used molecular typing results in their routine TB surveillance work. The PHOs used molecular typing results especially as support for epidemiological contact tracing (62/88, 70.4%). We found statistically significant differences between answers of PHOs that did not use molecular typing results (n=86) vs. PHOs that did use molecular typing results (n=88): the latter perceived the use of molecular typing results as more beneficial for their work compared to the former (65.9% vs. 34.9%, p<0.05). Moreover, the PHOs using molecular typing results expect for the future more support and coordination from regional and national public health institutes, especially regarding the identification and analysis of molecular clusters.
   Conclusions: Our study is a step forward in the broader goal of implementing an IMS of TB in Germany. The local PHOs currently using the molecular typing results highlighted their positive attitude towards the implementation of an IMS, but also their needs of more support. Similar assessments might serve as an example for other countries which are on the way to implement a nationwide IMS of TB.

DT Article
DE Descriptive epidemiology; Disease outbreaks; Rubella; School
ID MEASLES; EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Background: Rubella is a vaccine-preventable contagious disease causing an estimated 100,000 children to be born with congenital rubella syndrome each year globally. Studies documented that 18 rubella outbreaks were occurred each year in Ethiopia. Yeka sub-city woreda 13 public health emergency management office reported two measles suspected cases on 8 February, 2018. We investigated this outbreak to identify its etiology, describe the outbreak and implement control measures.
   Methods: We described the outbreak using descriptive epidemiology. The study population was defined as students learning in the school where the outbreak occurred. Suspected rubella case was defined as student with generalized rash whereas confirmed case was suspected case tested positive for rubella IgM. Questionnaires, checklists and students record review were used to collect data. We searched for new cases in classes daily and excluded them from classes. The school environment was assessed and the outbreak was described in person and time.
   Results: We identified 58 cases (median age: 4.6 years; IQR: 4-5 years) with six of them rubella IgM positive and 52 epidemiologically linked. The outbreak began on 8 February 2018 having multiple intermittent peaks during its course reaching its highest peak at 2 April, 2018 and ended on 20 April, 2018. Index cases were reported from two classes; however, cases were occurred in 13/15(86.67%) of the classes during the entire outbreak. Fifty five percent (32/58) and 45/58(77.59%) of the cases were females and 3-5 years children, respectively. Overall attack rate was 58/531(4.05%). Attack rate was higher in females 32/252 (12.7%) than in males 26/279 (9.32%), and higher 45/275(16.36%) in 3-5 years than those in 5-8 years 13/256(5.08%) children. Case fatality ratio was zero. All cases were vaccinated against measles but unvaccinated against rubella.
   Conclusions: Attack rate was higher in females than in males and higher in 3-5 years than 5-8 years children. We recommended establishing rubella surveillance system, conducting sero-prevalence of rubella among child bearing age females and establishing CRS surveillance among young infants to provide evidence-based information for RCV introduction. It was also recommended to develop a national rubella surveillance guideline which aid to exclude rubella cases from schools during outbreak.

AB Background
   Comprehensive care given to people living with HIV/AIDS is improving over time; however, their concurrent cognitive illness is still ignored, under screened and treated particularly in developing countries. And this problem is also striking in Ethiopia. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders and associated factors among adult people living with HIV/AIDS.
   Methods
   An institution based cross sectional study was conducted from April to May, 2017 at Gamo Gofa zone public Hospitals. International HIV Dementia Scale was used to screen HIV associated neurocognitive disorders. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess predictors of neurocognitive disorders.
   Result
   A total of 684 study participants were included in this study with a response rate of 98%. Among them, 56% were females while 44% were males. The mean (+/- SD) age of the participants was 38.8 +/- 8.8years. The screening prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder was 67.1% (95% CI; 63.6, 70.5). Body mass index 16 kg/m(2) (AOR 4.389 (1.60312.016)), being married (AOR 0.377 (0.2130.666), unemployment status (AOR 3.181 (1.7525.777) and being in WHO clinical stage T3 category/advancing stages of the disease (AOR 3.558 (1.4069.006) were the key predictors of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders among people living with HIV/AIDS.
   Conclusion
   In this study the screening prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder is higher than the earlier reports in Ethiopia and Africa. This indicates that early screening strategies and policies for cognitive health in people living with HIV/AIDS should be given a top priority.

AB In order to optimize environmental interventions, the current study aimed to investigate whether there are subgroups with different preferences regarding park characteristics for park visitation and park-based PA among adolescents (1216 years). Furthermore, we examined whether the identified subgroups differed in socio-demographics, PA behavior, and park use characteristics (e.g. accompaniment to park, usual activities during park visitation, usual transportation to parks). Adolescents (1216 years) were recruited via randomly selected secondary schools, located in Flanders (Belgium). Class visits were conducted between September and November 2016 and adolescents were asked to complete an online questionnaire. Latent class analyses using Sawtooth Software were used to identify possible subgroups. A final sample of 972 adolescents (mean age 13.3 +/- 1.3 years) remained for analyses. Three subgroups of adolescents with similar preferences for park characteristics could be distinguished for both park visitation and park-based PA. Overall, current results indicate that park upkeep was the most important park characteristic for park visitation as well as park-based PA among at risk subgroups (i.e. adolescents with lower overall PA levels, girls, older adolescents,....) followed by the presence of a playground or outdoor fitness equipment. Among the more active adolescents, especially boys visiting the parks together with friends, the presence of a sport field (soccer and basketball) seems to be the best strategy to increase park visitation as well as park-based PA. Current results provide a starting point to advise policy makers and urban planners when designing or renovating parks that investing in good upkeep and maintenance of parks, and the provision of a playground or outdoor fitness equipment might be the best strategy to increase both park visitation and park-based PA among at risk adolescent subgroups.

TI A different suite: The assemblage of distinct fungal communities in

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; DIVERSITY; HOMES; DUST; PCR
AB Water-damaged housing has been associated with a number of negative health outcomes, principally respiratory disease and asthma. Much of what we know about fungi associated with water-damaged buildings has come from culture-based and immunochemical methods. Few studies have used high-throughput sequencing technologies to assess the impact of water-damage on microbial communities in residential buildings. In this study we used amplicon sequencing and quantitative-PCR to evaluate fungal communities on surfaces and in airborne dust in multiple units of a condemned public housing project located in the San Francisco Bay Area. We recruited 21 households to participate in this study and characterized their apartments as either a unit with visible mold or no visible mold. We sampled airborne fungi from dust settled over a month-long time period from the outdoors, in units with no visible mold, and units with visible mold. In units with visible mold we additionally sampled the visible fungal colonies from bathrooms, kitchens, bedrooms, and living rooms. We found that fungal biomass in settled dust was greater outdoors compared to indoors, but there was no significant difference of fungal biomass in units with visible mold and no visible mold. Interestingly, we found that fungal diversity was reduced in units with visible mold compared to units with no visible mold and the outdoors. Units with visible mold harbored fungal communities distinct from units with no visible mold and the outdoors. Units with visible mold had a greater abundance of taxa within the classes Eurotiomycetes, Saccharomycetes, and Wallemiomycetes. Colonies of fungi collected from units with visible mold were dominated by two Cladosporium species, C. sphaerospermum and C halotolerans. This study demonstrates that high-throughput sequencing of fungi indoors can be a useful strategy for distinguishing distinct microbial exposures in water-damaged homes with visible and nonvisible mold growth, and may provide a microbial means for identifying water damaged housing.

TI The variation of the burden of hypertension and diabetes in two large
   districts of the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, based on primary health care
   routinely-collected data
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) were responsible for 72.3% of global deaths in 2016, with cardiovascular diseases accounting for almost half of those deaths and low-and middle-income countries carrying the biggest burden. As a result, the prevention and control of NCDs is recognized as urgent, while better surveillance at the country level could result in more effective policies. Hence, the objective of this study was to obtain more detailed information on the distribution of the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes among the population of two large districts of the city of Sao Paulo in Brazil, and to compare these findings to the results of a citywide health survey.
   Methods and findings
   This cross-sectional study used primary health care (PHC) routinely-collected data. The study population included 187,110 individuals 20 years of age or older registered in 13 public PHC facilities at two districts of the city of Sao Paulo in 2015. Data extracted from SIAB, a primary care database, was used to calculate age and sex directly standardized prevalences for diabetes and hypertension for each PHC facility. The prevalence of hypertension among women was significantly higher than the prevalence among men in the entire study population, and in every PHC facility. There was great variation among PHC facilities that was more pronounced among women. The prevalence of diabetes among women was significantly higher than the prevalence among men in the entire study population, and in every PHC facility, but there was little variation among PHC facilities.
   Conclusions
   This study provided information that could help with policy planning and allocation of resources, and demonstrated the use of PHC routinely-collected data to generate important insights that if replicated could have a substantial impact given the broad coverage of the national public PHC program in Brazil.

AB BackgroundInfection with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a serious public health problem worldwide, with over 360 million carriers. Sixty million of these are resident in Sub-saharan Africa. Hepatitis B infection is the cause of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is the second commonest cause of death from cancers among women in The Gambia. Vertical transmission is the commonest route of spread of Hepatitis B Virus in many endemic areas. The main aim of the study was to determine the sero-prevalence of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) among pregnant women attending antenatal clinic at the Edward Francis Small Teaching Hospital, Banjul, The Gambia.MethodsFour hundred and twenty six pregnant women were recruited from our antenatal clinics and tested for HBsAg. Serum Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was tested using commercial rapid diagnostic Elisa kits at the point of care.ResultsA prevalence rate of 9.20% among all pregnant women studied was found. Women who were likely to have been vaccinated had a prevalence rate of 2.30% whiles those unlikely to have been vaccinated had a prevalence of 13.71%. There was a statistically significant difference between those likely to have been vaccinated and those unlikely to have been vaccinated.ConclusionThe prevalence of hepatitis B infection is very high among pregnant women at EFSTH as in the high endemic zone that is more than 8%. However the prevalence rate is lower than the national average of 15%. The prevalence is of moderate endemicity among the women who likely received vaccination during childhood. More interventions during pregnancy need to be undertaken if more successes are to be registered.

AB BackgroundThe use of medications, including herbal medicines during breastfeeding is always a concern among women. Currently, there is no published evidence on whether Sierra Leonean women use herbal medicine during breastfeeding. This study investigates the prevalence, correlates and pattern of herbal medicine use during breastfeeding.MethodologyWe conducted a cross-sectional study among 378 current breastfeeding mothers visiting public healthcare facilities within the Western area of Sierra Leone. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were used for data analysis.ResultsOver a third of mothers (n=140, 37.0%) used herbal medicine during breastfeeding. However, very few herbal medicine users (2.1%, n=3) used herbal medicine to augment breastfeeding. Dietary changes were the most common method used to increase breast milk supply (93.9%, n=355) with cassava leaves sauce and tubers being the most common dietary addition. Mothers with children more than six months old were more likely to use herbal medicine than mothers with younger children (OR:1.8; CI:1.13-2.85,p=0.013). Among herbal medicine users, only 11.4% (n=16) disclosed their herbal medicine use to their conventional healthcare providers.ConclusionThe use of herbal medicine among breastfeeding mothers attending public health facilities in the Western area of Sierra Leone is common. Whilst this use is not usually specific to increasing breast milk supply, our study indicates that herbal medicines may be used to cleanse' initial breast milk.

AB BackgroundHerbal medicine has become the panacea for many rural pregnant women in Ghana despite the modern western antenatal care which has developed in most parts of the country. To our knowledge, previous studies investigating herbal medicine use haveprimarily reported general attitudes and perceptions of use, overlooking the standpoint of pregnant women and theirattitudes, and utilisation of herbal medicine in Ghana. Knowledge of herbal medicine use among rural pregnant women and the potential side effects of many herbs in pregnancy are therefore limited inthe country; this qualitative study attempts to address this gap by exploring the perceptions of herbal medicine usage among pregnant women in rural Ghana.MethodsA sample of 30, conveniently selected pregnant women, were involved in this study from April 11 to June 22, 2017. Data from three different focus group discussions were thematically analysed and presented based on an a posteriori inductive reduction approach.ResultsThe main findings were that pregnant women used herbal medicine, most commonly ginger, peppermint, thyme, chamomile, aniseeds, green tea, tealeaf, raspberry, and echinacea leaf consistently throughout the three trimesters of pregnancy. Cultural norms and health beliefs in the form of personal philosophies, desire to manage one's own health, illness perceptions, anda holistic healing approach were ascribed to the widespread use of herbs.ConclusionWe recommend public education and awareness on disclosure of herbal medicine use to medical practitioners among pregnant women.

AB BackgroundCancer indicators are essential information for cancer surveillance and cancer research strategy development. The Martinique Cancer Registry (MCR) is a population-based cancer Registry (PBCR) that has been recording cancer data since its creation in 1981. This article provides cancer incidence and mortality data for all cancers and for major tumor sites.MethodsThe registry collects all new cancer cases, details of the individual affected, tumor site and follow-up. World-standardized incidence and mortality rates were calculated, by tumor site and sex for solid tumors from the MCR database for the study period 2001-2015.ResultsOver the period 2001-2015, a total of 22,801 new cases were diagnosed; 13,863 in men (60.8%) and 8938 in women (39.2%). In 2011-2015, 1631 new cases were diagnosed per year. Age-standardized (to the world population) incidence rates for all cancers, were 289.8 per 100,000 men and 171.0 per 100,000 women. Breast, colon-rectum and stomach were the most common cancer sites in women. Prostate, colon-rectum and stomach were the main sites in men. Martinique has higher incidence rates of prostate and stomach cancer than mainland France.ConclusionsProstate and stomach cancers have high incidence and rank first among the four major tumor sites. Providing data for the French zone of the Caribbean is essential to contributing to the development of high-priority public health measures for the Caribbean zone.

AB BackgroundGhana is experiencing an epidemiological shift in public health issues toward non-communicable diseases that are underpinned by modifiable health behaviors. Physical activity rates have decreased, especially among older adults, coinciding with urbanization and an increase in sedentary work. Community-based physical activity programs are a recommended method of increasing physical activity levels; however, none currently exist in Ghana. The aim of this exploratory study was to determine older Ghanaian adults' perceptions of physical activity and asses fit and feasibility of adapting and delivering a physical activity program for this population.MethodsThrough a concurrent exploratory mixed-methods design, data were gathered from Ghanaian older adults (N=123) during focus groups (N=10) conducted at one diabetes clinic and nine churches across three urban areas. Qualitative data were collected using a semi-structured script that prompted for responses related to physical activity perceptions and the fit and feasibility of physical activity program characteristics. Quantitative data were collected through a questionnaire assessing participant demographics, physical activity levels, and health rating as well as physical activity knowledge and self-efficacy.ResultsFindings indicate that older adults in Ghana have a need for and an interest in physical activity promotion. Participants had positive perceptions of being physically active, but were unaware of physical activity guidelines and how to meet them. Peer influence and health care providers' recommendations were motivating factors for physical activity participation. As for desired physical activity program characteristics, participants expressed interest in group-based activities and becoming peer leaders and preference for a church-based program.ConclusionsThe results suggest that a group-based physical activity program encouraged by health care providers and delivered at churches through a train-the-trainer model would be well received by aging adults from three urban areas of Ghana. In addition, education on physical activity types is needed, along with better dissemination and education on Ministry of Health physical activity guidelines. This exploratory work highlights preliminary support for a group- and community-based physical activity program for the aging population in Ghana. Beginning with the end in mind, these program characteristics should be considered when adopting, adapting, and implementing an intervention with this population.

AB BackgroundHealthcare professionals are key informants to support individual behaviour change, and although there has been some progress in empowering clinicians to promote physical activity and health at work, an effective strategy overarching the whole medical educational journey is still lacking. This report provides an overview from the Moving Healthcare Professionals programme (MHPP), a whole-system educational approach to embed prevention and physical activity promotion into clinical practice.MethodsThe MHPP model integrates educational resources into three core domains of medical education: undergraduate education, postgraduate education and continuing professional development. The interventions are designed to spiral through existing educational approaches rather than as additional special study modules or bolt-on courses, thus reducing self-selection bias in exposure. Interventions include spiral undergraduate education materials, e-learning, embedded post-graduate resources and face-to-face peer-to-peer education.ResultsTo date the MHPP model has been applied in two key areas, physical activity and health and work. The physical activity programme in a partnership between Public Health England and Sport England has delivered face-to-face training to 17,105 healthcare professionals, embedded materials in almost three quarters of English medical schools and overseen >95,000 e-learning modules completed over two and half years. Evaluation of the individual elements of the model is ongoing and aims to show improvements in knowledge, skills and practice. Further evaluation is planned to assess patient impact.ConclusionsThe MHPP model offers a coherent whole-system approach to embed public health action into existing healthcare education models, and as such provides a framework for rapid change as well as upstream implementation to support the clinicians of today and tomorrow.

AB BackgroundWe aimed to identify different eating habits among Finnish children and to evaluate their association with meal patterns, breakfast consumption, and socio-demographic characteristics in a large, nationwide cohort of children.MethodsWe evaluated 10,569 children aged 9-14years into the Finnish Health in Teens cohort in a cross-sectional design. The hierarchical K-means method was used to identify groups of children with different eating habits, based on five factors obtained through factor analysis of 10 food items. Multiple correspondence analysis was used to show associations between groups with different eating habits and meal patterns, breakfast patterns, gender, age, and language spoken at home.ResultsAnalyses identified three groups: unhealthy eaters (12.3%), fruit and vegetable avoiders (43.3%), and healthy eaters (44.1%). Most children had regular meal and breakfast patterns. The proportion of boys was higher among unhealthy eaters. Unhealthy eaters also showed irregular meal and breakfast patterns, and had parents with low education level. There was a higher proportion of girls among healthy eaters. Healthy eaters also showed regular meal and breakfast patterns, and had parents with high education level.ConclusionsAlthough the number of unhealthy eaters was small, special attention should be still paid to these, mostly male children, as they have poor eating habits and they lack regular eating routine. Skipping breakfast was more common among older children and girls, although girls had healthier eating habits overall. Our results can contribute to public health efforts to improve eating behaviours, especially among children with poor eating habits and those skipping healthy food items.

AB BackgroundRacism is a key determinant of the health of Indigenous Australians that may explain the unremitting gap in health and socioeconomic outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. We quantified the population-based prevalence of experiences of racism of Indigenous adults in the Australian state of Victoria and investigated whether this was independent of social determinants and lifestyle risk factors.MethodsWe combined data from the 2011, 2012 and 2014 Victorian Population Health Surveys to obtain a sample size of 33,833 Victorian adults, including 387 Indigenous adults. The survey is a cross-sectional, population-based, computer-assisted telephone interview survey conducted annually. Using logistic regression, experiences of racism was the dependent variable and Indigenous status the primary independent variable of interest. Secondary independent variables included age, sex, rurality, socioeconomic status, social capital, and lifestyle risk factors.ResultsIndigenous Victorian adults were four times more likely than their non-Indigenous counterparts to have experienced racism in the preceding 12months; odds ratio (OR)=4.3 (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.2-5.8). Controlling for social determinants and lifestyle risk factors attenuated, but did not eliminate, the association between experiences of racism and Indigenous status; OR=3.1 (95% CI: 2.2-4.3). The social determinants of age and social trust made the largest contribution to the attenuation of the association. Education also had a large impact on the association, but in the opposite direction, suggesting that a low level of education may be protective against experiences of racism. When the non-Indigenous comparison group consisted of adults of mainly Anglo-Celtic origin, Indigenous adults were seven times more likely (OR=7.2; 5.3-9.7) to have experienced racism.ConclusionsRacism directed against Indigenous Victorians is significant and cannot be ascribed to any specific attributes such as socioeconomic status or lifestyle risk factors. We argue that a human rights-based approach to policy-making for the elimination of systemic and interpersonal racism offers an opportunity and viable alternative to current policy-making, that continues to be dominated by a paternalistic approach that reinforces racism and the resulting inequities.Please noteThroughout this document, the term Indigenous is taken to include people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent. While not our preferred term, Indigenous is used in preference to Aboriginal and Koori as not all Indigenous people living in Victoria are Aboriginal or Koori. We recognise that, with the exception of the term Koori', these terms are Eurocentric having been imposed upon a people of many nations with distinct languages and cultures. The use of such terms is akin to referring to the peoples of the continent of Europe as Europeans'.

TI Detection of critical antibiotic resistance genes through routine
   microbiome surveillance
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MECHANISMS; AUTOPSY
AB Population-based public health data on antibiotic resistance gene carriage is poorly surveyed. Research of the human microbiome as an antibiotic resistance reservoir has primarily focused on gut associated microbial communities, but data have shown more widespread microbial colonization across organs than originally believed, with organs previously considered as sterile being colonized. Our study demonstrates the utility of postmortem microbiome sampling during routine autopsy as a method to survey antibiotic resistance carriage in a general population. Postmortem microbial sampling detected pathogens of public health concern including genes for multidrug efflux pumps, carbapenem, methicillin, vancomycin, and polymixin resistances. Results suggest that postmortem assessments of host-associated microbial communities are useful in acquiring community specific data while reducing selective-participant biases.

AB As in many nations, air pollution linked to rapid industrialization is a public health and environmental concern in Malaysia, especially in cities. Understanding awareness of air pollution and support for environmental protection from the general public is essential for informing governmental approaches to dealing with this problem. This study presents a cross-sectional survey conducted in the Klang Valley and Iskandar conurbations to examine urban Malaysians' perception, awareness and opinions of air pollution. The survey was conducted in two languages, English and Malay, and administered through the online survey research software, Qualtrics. The survey consisted of three sections, where we collected sociodemographic information, information on the public perception of air quality and the causes of air pollution, information on public awareness of air pollution and its related impacts, and information on attitudes towards environmental protection. Of 214 respondents, over 60% were positive towards the air quality at both study sites despite the presence of harmful levels of air pollution. The air in the Klang Valley was perceived to be slightly more polluted and causing greater health issues. Overall, the majority of respondents were aware that motor vehicles represent the primary pollution source, yet private transport was still the preferred choice of transportation mode. A generally positive approach towards environmental protection emerged from the data. However, participants showed stronger agreement with protection actions that do not involve individual effort. Nonetheless, we found that certain segments of the sample (people owning more than three vehicles per household and those with relatives who suffered from respiratory diseases) were significantly more willing to personally pay for environmental protection compared to others. Implications point to the need for actions for spreading awareness of air pollution to the overall population, especially with regards to its health risks, as well as strategies for increasing the perception of behavioural control, especially with regards to motor vehicles' usage.

TI Evaluation of the cutaneous sensation of the face in patients with
   different clinical forms of leprosy
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID NEURAL LEPROSY
AB Background
   Leprosy can be considered to be the most common peripheral neuropathy of infectious etiology and constitutes a public health problem. The standard routine examination for assessing sensory impairment in leprosy neuropathy basically evaluates hands, feet and eyes. However, evaluation of facial cutaneous sensation is not routinely performed.
   Objectives
   The aim of this study was to evaluate facial cutaneous sensation in patients with different clinical forms of leprosy and compare the findings with those from healthy individuals.
   Methodology
   19 healthy controls and 71 leprosy patients who were being treated at a national reference center for leprosy in Brazil underwent facial sensation assessment using the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test. This test was applied over the facial areas corresponding to the ophthalmic, maxillary and mandibular distal branches of the trigeminal nerve.
   Results
   The predominant clinical form in terms of changes to facial cutaneous sensation was lepromatous leprosy (LL), followed by the borderline-borderline (BB), and borderline-lepromatous (BL) forms, in comparison with healthy individuals. The distal branches most affected were the zygomatic (28.2%; 20/71), buccal (23.9%; 17/71) and nasal (22.5%; 16/71). There was asymmetrical sensory impairment of the face in 62.5% (20/32) of the cases.
   Conclusion
   The face is just as impaired in leprosy as are the feet, hands and eyes, but facial impairment is underdiagnosed. Our evaluation on the different sensory branches and evidence of asymmetrical impairment of the face confirm the classically described pattern of leprosy neuropathy, i.e. consisting of asymmetrical and predominantly sensory peripheral neuropathy.

TI Directional dependence between major cities in China based on copula
   regression on air pollution measurements
SO PLOS ONE

   SCATTERING; PM2.5; MODEL
AB Air pollution is well-known as a major risk to public health, causing various diseases including pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases. As social concern increases, the amount of air pollution data is increasing rapidly. The purpose of this study is to statistically characterize dependence between major cities in China based on a measure of directional dependence estimated from PM2.5 measurements. As a measure of the directional dependence, we propose the so-called copula directional dependence (CDD) using beta regression models. An advantage of the CDD is that it does not rely on strict assumptions of specific probability distributions or linearity. We used hourly PM2.5 measurement data collected at four major cities in China: Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou, and Shanghai, from 2013 to 2017. After accounting for autocorrelation in the PM2.5 time series via nonlinear autoregressive models, CDDs between the four cities were estimated to produce directed network structures of statistical dependence. In addition, a statistical method was proposed to test the directionality of dependence between each pair of cities. From the PM2.5 data, we could discover that Chengdu and Guangzhou are the most closely related cities and that the directionality between them has changed once during 2013 to 2017, which implies a major economic or environmental change in these Chinese regions.

TI Knowledge and attitudes of theatre staff prior to the implementation of
   robotic-assisted surgery in the public sector
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   The use of robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) is becoming increasingly prevalent across a range of surgical specialties within public hospitals around Australia. As a result, it is critical that organisations consider workplace factors such as staff knowledge, attitudes and behaviours prior to the implementation of such new technology. This study aimed to describe the knowledge and attitudes of operating theatre staff from a large public tertiary referral hospital prior to the commencement of an RAS program.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional survey of nursing, medical and support staff working in the operating theatre complex of a large public tertiary referral hospital was completed over a one-week period in June 2016. A 23-item questionnaire was utilised for data collection.
   Results
   164 (66%) theatre staff returned the surveys and were included in this study. The majority of medical staff reported being knowledgeable about RAS, whilst the majority of nursing and support staff did not. Overall the theatre staff were neutral about the potential benefits of RAS to patients. The majority of medical staff believed the implementation of RAS will increase the value of staff roles and job satisfaction, while nursing and support staff were uncertain about these benefits. All three staff groups were concerned about the impact of an RAS program on Workplace Health and Safety, and care and handling.
   Conclusion Operating theatre staff presented different knowledge and attitudes prior to the introduction of RAS. Whilst theatre staff were more favourable towards RAS than negative, they largely reserved their judgement about the new system prior to their own experiences. Collectively, these findings should be taken into consideration for training and support strategies prior to the implementation of a RAS program.

ID CARE UTILIZATION; OLDER-PEOPLE; INSTITUTIONALIZATION; POPULATION;
   TRANSITIONS; HEALTH; DEATH; DEMENTIA; IMPACT; RISK
AB Background
   Previous research has focussed on individual-level determinants of nursing home admission (NHA), although substantial variation in the prevalence of NHA between European countries suggests a substantial impact of country of residence. The aim of this analysis was to assess individual-level determinants and the role of country of residence and specifically a country` s public institutional long-term care infrastructure on proxy-reported NHA in the last year of life.
   Methods
   We analysed data from 7,018 deceased respondents (65+) of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (2004-2015, 16 countries) using Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression analysis in order to model proxy-reported NHA.
   Results
   In total, 14% of the general older population utilised nursing home care in the last year of life but there was substantial variation across countries (range = 2-30%). On the individuallevel, need factors such as functional and cognitive impairment were the strongest predictors of NHA. In total, 18% of the variance of NHA was located at the country-level; public expenditure on institutional care strongly affected the chance of NHA in the last year of life.
   Conclusion
   On the individual-level, the strong impact of need factors indicated equitable access to NHA, whereas differences in public spending for institutional care indicated inequitable access across European countries.

TI Increased uptake of early initiation of antiretroviral therapy and

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID HIV; RATES
AB Background
   Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (eiART) can improve clinical outcomes for persons with HIV and reduce onward transmission risk. Baseline drug resistance testing (bDRT) can inform regimen selection upon subsequent treatment initiation. We examined the uptake of eiART and bDRT within 3 months and 30 days of HIV diagnosis.
   Methods
   We analyzed a population-based sample from the San Francisco Department of Public Health HIV/AIDS Case Registry of newly-diagnosed HIV/non-AIDS individuals between 2001 and 2015 who received care at publicly-funded facilities (N = 3,124).
   Results
   Uptake of eiART within 3 months of diagnosis increased significantly from 2001 to 2015 (p<0.001), peaking at 74% in 2015. bDRT uptake also increased significantly (p<0.001), peaking at 55% in 2012. eiART uptake was observed to be significantly associated with gender, age, race/ethnicity and transmission risk. There were no significant differences observed in demographic and risk characteristics of persons receiving bDRT in the more recent years. Of 990 persons diagnosed between 2010 and 2015, eiART uptake within 30 days of diagnosis increased from 13% to 38% (p<0.001); bDRT uptake increased from 35% to 39% but the change was not significant (p = 0.141).
   Conclusions
   Observed increases in eiART and bDRT uptake from 2010 to 2015 may reflect the adoption of treatment as prevention and a local public health policy statement in 2010 recommending treatment initiation at time of diagnosis irrespective of CD4 count. Concerns about stigma may underlie disparities in eiART, however such concerns would not bear as directly on a provider-initiated laboratory test like bDRT.

AB Preterm birth continues to be an important problem in modern obstetrics and a large public health concern and is related to increased risk for neonatal morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the data in the literature to determine the relationships between mode of delivery (cesarean section and vaginal birth) in the first pregnancy and the risk of subsequent preterm birth from a multi-year population based cohorts (PROSPERO registration number: 42018090788). Five electronic databases were searched. Observational studies that provided mode of delivery and subsequent preterm birth were eligible. Ten cohort studies, involving 10333501 women, were included in this study. Compared with vaginal delivery, women delivering by previous cesarean section had a significantly higher risk of preterm birth in subsequent births (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.20). After adjusting confounding factors, there was still statistical significance (aRR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.24). However, both before and after adjustment, there was no difference among very preterm birth (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.90-1.43; aRR 1.16, 95% CI 0.80-1.68; respectively). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis that suggests previous cesarean section could increase the risk of preterm birth in subsequent pregnancies. The result could provide policy makers, clinicians, and expectant parents to reduce the occurrence of unnecessary cesarean section.

AB BackgroundTuberculosis and diabetes mellitus are significant global public health challenges. In Sub-Saharan Africa, study findings regarding prevalence of diabetes mellitus amongst tuberculosis patients have been inconsistent and highly variable. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis estimates the overall prevalence of diabetes mellitus among tuberculosis patients in Sub-Saharan Africa.MethodsFour international databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct and Cochrane Library) were systematically searched. We included all observational studies reporting the prevalence of DM among TB patients in Sub-Saharan Africa. All necessary data for this review were extracted using a standardized data extraction format by two authors (CT and AA1). STATA Version 14 statistical software was employed to conduct meta-analysis. The Cochrane Q test statistics and I-2 test were used to assess the heterogeneity of the studies. Finally, a random effects meta-analysis model was computed to estimate the pooled prevalence of diabetes mellitus in TB patients. Besides, subgroup analysis was done based on different factors.ResultsIn the meta-analysis, sixteen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included. The findings of these 16 studies revealed that the pooled prevalence of diabetes mellitus among tuberculosis patients in Sub-Saharan Africa was 9.0% (95% CI: 6.0, 12.0%). The highest prevalence of diabetes mellitus among tuberculosis patients was found in Nigeria (15%), followed by Tanzania (11%), and then Ethiopia (10%). Besides, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus among HIV infected TB patients was (8.9%) which is slightly higher than HIV uninfected (7.7%) TB patients.ConclusionDiabetes mellitus among tuberculosis patients in Sub-Saharan Africa was significantly high. Moreover, this study found that there was a high prevalence of DM among HIV infected than uninfected TB patients. It is strongly recommended to screen for DM among TB patients and special emphasis should be given for early screening of DM among TB/HIV co-infected patients.

AB BackgroundCampylobacteriosis is a major public health concern. The weather factors that influence spatial and seasonal distributions are not fully understood.MethodsTo investigate the impacts of temperature and rainfall on Campylobacter infections in England and Wales, cases of Campylobacter were linked to local temperature and rainfall at laboratory postcodes in the 30days before the specimen date. Methods for investigation included a comparative conditional incidence, wavelet, clustering, and time series analyses.ResultsThe increase of Campylobacter infections in the late spring was significantly linked to temperature two weeks before, with an increase in conditional incidence of 0.175 cases per 100,000 per week for weeks 17 to 24; the relationship to temperature was not linear. Generalized structural time series model revealed that changes in temperature accounted for 33.3% of the expected cases of Campylobacteriosis, with an indication of the direction and relevant temperature range. Wavelet analysis showed a strong annual cycle with additional harmonics at four and six months. Cluster analysis showed three clusters of seasonality with geographic similarities representing metropolitan, rural, and other areas.ConclusionsThe association of Campylobacteriosis with temperature is likely to be indirect. High-resolution spatial temporal linkage of weather parameters and cases is important in improving weather associations with infectious diseases. The primary driver of Campylobacter incidence remains to be determined; other avenues, such as insect contamination of chicken flocks through poor biosecurity should be explored.

AB BackgroundAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an increasing public health problem worldwide.We studied some patient-related factors that might influence the antimicrobial resistance.and whether the volume of antibiotic prescribing of the primary care physicians correlate with the antibiotic resistance rates of commensal nasal Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae.MethodsThe socio-demographic questionnaires, the antibiotic prescription and resistance data of commensal nasal S. aureus and S. pneumoniae were collected in the 20 participating Hungarian practices of the APRES study.Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed on the patient-related data and the antimicrobial resistance of the S. aureus and S. pneumoniae on individual, patient level.Ecological analyses were performed with Spearman's rank correlations at practice level, the analyses were performed in the whole sample (all practices) and in the cohorts of primary care practices taking care of adults (adult practices) or children (paediatric practices).ResultsAccording to the multivariate model, age of the patients significantly influenced the antimicrobial resistance of the S. aureus (OR=0.42, p=0.004) and S. pneumoniae (OR=0.89, p<0.001). Living with children significantly increased the AMR of the S. pneumoniae (OR=1.23, p=0.019). In the cohorts of adult or paediatric practices, neither the age nor other variables influenced the AMR of the S. aureus and S. pneumoniae.At practice level, the prescribed volume of penicillins significantly correlated with the resistance rates of the S. aureus isolates to penicillin (rho=0.57, p=0.008). The volume of prescribed macrolides, lincosamides showed positive significant correlations with the S. pneumoniae resistance rates to clarithromycin and/or clindamycin in all practices (rho=0.76, p=0.001) and in the adult practices (rho=0.63, p=0.021).ConclusionsThe age isan important influencing factor of antimicrobial resistance. The results also suggest that there may be an association between the antibiotic prescribing of the primary care providers and the antibiotic resistance of the commensal S. aureus and S. pneumoniae. The role of the primary care physicians in the appropriate antibiotic prescribing is very important to avoid the antibiotic resistance.

AB Background
   Molecular typing and whole genome sequencing (WGS) information is used for (inter-) national outbreak investigations. To assist the implementation of these techniques for tuberculosis (TB) surveillance and outbreak investigations at European level there is a need for inter-country collaboration and standardization. This demands more information on molecular typing practices and capabilities of individual countries. We aimed to review the use of molecular/genomic typing for TB surveillance in European Union and European Economic Area countries in 2016; assess its public health value; and collect experiences on typing data use for cross-border cluster investigations.
   Method
   A web-based questionnaire was provided to all TB National Focal Points. The questionnaire consisted of three parts: i) Use and integration of molecular and genomic typing data into TB surveillance; ii) Cross-border cluster investigation and international collaboration, and iii) Perception and evaluation of public health benefits of molecular and genomic typing for TB surveillance.
   Results
   Of 26 responding countries, 20 used molecular typing for TB surveillance, including nine applying WGS. The level of integration into the national surveillance was heterogeneous. Among six countries not using typing for TB surveillance, more than half planned its implementation soon. Overall, most countries perceived an added public health value of molecular typing for TB control. Concerning international cluster investigations, countries had little experience and did not have standard protocols to exchange typing data.
   Conclusion
   Our study shows a wide use of molecular and genomic typing data for TB surveillance in EU/EEA countries and reveals that transition to WGS-based typing is ongoing or is considered in most countries. However, our results also show a high heterogeneity in the use and integration of typing data for TB surveillance. Standardization of typing data use for TB surveillance is needed and formal procedures should be developed to facilitate international collaboration.

AB Background
   Psychological distress including depression and anxiety are among the most serious causes of morbidity and mortality in Bangladesh. There has been no study in the rural area to report the prevalence of and risk factors for psychological distress. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of and risk factors for psychological distress in a rural district in Bangladesh.
   Methods
   A total of 2425 adults (1249 women) aged 18-90 years were selected from the Narail upazilla using multi-level cluster random sampling for a cross-sectional study. Psychological distress was assessed using the Kessler 10 items questionnaire. Participants' socio-demographic status, life style factors and health conditions were also collected. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for binary outcomes and mean changes for continuous outcomes of psychological distress score were computed. Logistic regression and generalized linear model techniques were used for analytical purpose.
   Results
   The overall prevalence of psychological distress was 52.5%. This proportion included 22.7% people rated as having mild psychological distress, 20.8% moderate and 9.0% severe. The prevalence of moderate (24.7% vs. 17.5%, p<0.001) and severe (16.2% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001) psychological distress was significantly higher in older adults of age 60-90 years than that in younger adults of age 18-59 years. The prevalence of severe psychological distress was higher in females than males and the difference increased with age (vs. (females vs males: 1.9% vs. 1.1% at age of <30 years, 12.2% vs. 10.1% at age between 60-69 years, and 45.5% vs. 25.4% at age of 80 years or older). After multivariate adjustment, compared to degree or equivalent level of education, no education (odds ratio (OR), 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-2.82) was associated with higher prevalence of any psychological distress in the total sample. Compared to married, psychological distress among widowed older adults was almost five times higher prevalence (OR, 4.89, 95% CI, 2.51-9.55). Socio-economic status showed a U-shaped relationship with the prevalence of psychological distress; being very poor or wealthy was associated with higher prevalence of psychological distress compared to those of moderate socio-economic status. People living in pourashava (semi-urban areas) reported significantly higher prevalence of psychological distress compared to people living in typical rural unions.
   Conclusions In this rural Bangladeshi community, the prevalence of psychological distress was high, especially among older women. Factors including lower level of education, inability to work, and living in semi-urban areas were associated with higher prevalence of psychological distress. Public health programmes should target people in high risk groups to reduce their psychological distress in Bangladesh.

AB Dengue is an increasing public health concern worldwide and requires efficient laboratory diagnostics. We evaluated three commercially available dengue rapid diagnostic tests-the Humasis Dengue Combo NS1 & IgG/IgM (Humasis, Korea), SD Bioline Dengue Duo NS1 Ag & IgG/IgM (SD Bioline, Korea), and CareUS Dengue Combo NS1 and IgM/IgG kits (WellsBio, Korea)-and compared them to reference immunoglobulin M (IgM) or immunoglobulin G (IgG) ELISAs and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays. In total, 109 dengue-positive samples from children with acute symptomatic dengue and 63 dengue-negative samples from febrile and asymptomatic individuals were collected. For the nonstructural 1 protein (NS1) Ag test, the sensitivity and specificity were in the following order: CareUS (79.82 and 100%), Humasis (63.30 and 100%), and SD Bioline (48.62 and 100%). For IgM and IgG, CareUS had the highest sensitivities and specificities (89.91 and 100%; 82.57 and 100%, respectively), followed by SD Bioline (60.55 and 100%, 77.98 and 100%, respectively), and Humasis (51.38 and 98.21%, 72.48 and 95.24%, respectively). The IgM kits were more sensitive than the NS1 Ag or IgG kits; however, combining NS1 Ag and IgM reduced the number of missed cases. Therefore, the NS1 Ag plus IgM dengue kits increase the accuracy of the results. In our study, the CareUS Dengue Combo NS1 and IgM/IgG kit showed higher accuracy in performance with reference to qRT-PCR and ELISA results.

ID ACTIVE TUBERCULOSIS; RISK-FACTORS; VICTORIA; SMEAR
AB BackgroundIn current epidemiology of tuberculosis (TB), heterogeneity in infectiousness among TB patients is a challenge, which is not well studied. We aimed to quantify this heterogeneity and the presence of super-spreading events that can assist in designing optimal public health interventions.MethodsTB epidemiologic investigation data notified between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2015 from Victoria, Australia were used to quantify TB patients' heterogeneity in infectiousness and super-spreading events. We fitted a negative binomial offspring distribution (NBD) for the number of secondary infections and secondary active TB disease each TB patient produced. The dispersion parameter, k, of the NBD measures the level of heterogeneity, where low values of k (e.g. k<1) indicate over-dispersion. Super-spreading was defined as patients causing as many or more secondary infections as the 99th centile of an equivalent homogeneous distribution. Contact infection was determined based on a tuberculin skin test (TST) result of 10mm. A NBD model was fitted to identify index characteristics that were associated with the number of contacts infected and risk ratios (RRs) were used to quantify the strength of this association.ResultsThere were 4190 (2312 pulmonary and 1878 extrapulmonary) index TB patients and 18,030 contacts. A total of 15,522 contacts were tested with TST, of whom 3213 had a result of 10mm. The dispersion parameter, k for secondary infections was estimated at 0.16 (95%CI 0.14-0.17) and there were 414 (9.9%) super-spreading events. From the 3213 secondary infections, 2415 (75.2%) were due to super-spreading events. There were 226 contacts who developed active TB disease and a higher level of heterogeneity was found for this outcome than for secondary infection, with k estimated at 0.036 (95%CI 0.025-0.046). In regression analyses, we found that infectiousness was greater among index patients found by clinical presentation and those with bacteriological confirmation.ConclusionTB transmission is highly over dispersed and super-spreading events are responsible for a substantial majority of secondary infections. Heterogeneity of transmission and super-spreading are critical issues to consider in the design of interventions and models of TB transmission dynamics.

AB BackgroundBurn injury is a significant problem in low and middle-income countries. Moreover, across regions children are more affected by burn injury than adults. The outcome of burn injury is greatly influenced by the quality of care patients receive. This care includes meeting nutritional needs, availability of resources such as dressing supplies, and skills among health care providers. This study describes factors that influence provision of nursing care to the hospitalized pediatric patients with burn injuries at Muhimbili National Hospital, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.MethodsA descriptive qualitative study was conducted among registered nurses working in the Pediatric Burn Unit. Purposeful sampling was used to recruit the participants in the study. Five in-depth interviews were done and content analysis approach was used.ResultsThe nurses in the study described how they provided nursing care to pediatric patients with burn injuries. They described the use of closed method wound dressing, as an essential skill that accelerated wound healing, decreased the risk of wound contamination, and the incidence of contractures. The nurses felt gratified when they saw patients who had sustained severe burn injury recover well and be discharged home. They appreciated the influence of teamwork in burn patients' recovery. However, the interviews revealed systematic deficiencies that hindered provision of quality care to patients with burn injuries. The flaws included: inadequate staffing resulting in increased workload among the nurses; a lack of standard skills in burn care among nurses; lack of access to water, which is the mainstay of infection prevention control, and lack of specimen collection equipment.ConclusionsFindings in this study revealed both positive and negative factors which appear to influence care of burn patients. The positive factors (motivation) need to be maintained, and immediate actions should be taken to address the negative (hindering) factors. Large scale studies to quantify these results are deemed necessary, and public health measures are needed to prevent burn injuries in children.

AB BackgroundTuberculosis is a major public health problem with varying prevalence in different settings. National prevalence surveys provide evidence for planning and decision making. However, they lack the capacity to estimate subnational magnitude that affected the capacity to make selected intervention based on the prevalence. Ethiopia is among high TB burden countries with estimated prevalence of 108 per 100,000 population varying by regions. We aimed to study sub national prevalence of smear-positive TB in rural communities of southern Ethiopia.MethodsThis cross-sectional study, enrolled community members aged over 14years who had cough of at least two weeks duration. Two sputum samples were collected and examined byusing smear microscopy.Results38,304 eligible people were enumerated (10,779 from Hadiya, 10,059 from Gurage and 17,466 from Sidama) and indentified 960 presumptive cases. 16, 14 and 14 smear-positive pulmonary TB cases were identified respectively. The point prevalence of smear-positive TB were 148 per 100,000 population (95% CI: 91-241) in Hadiya, 139 per 100,000 population (95% CI: 83-234) in Gurage and 80/100,000 population (95%CI: 48-135) in Sidama zone. Gurage zone had the highest prevalent to notified cases of seven to one.ConclusionsThe prevalence of smear positive TB varies by districts and is high in rural southern Ethiopia compared to the estimated national prevalence. More TB patients remain missed and unreached, impacting negatively on health outcomes. TB case finding approaches should be revisited and innovative approaches and tools to identify missing people with TB should be scaled up.

AB BackgroundPregnant women and new mothers seeking asylum are highly vulnerable and have special needs, yet there is dearth of research related to this group in Germany. This paper reports on material circumstances and behavioural factors as social determinants of asylum seekers' health during pregnancy and early motherhood. The study aim was to gain in-depth insights into these women's experiences and perceived needs with a focus on material circumstances whilst living in state-provided accommodation in one federal state in Southern Germany.MethodsA qualitative, prospective approach was taken with individual semi-structured interviews of participants during pregnancy and up to the six-week postnatal assessment, aiming at interviewing each woman twice during pregnancy and once after giving birth. Two female interviewers performed interviews assisted by female professional interpreters on the telephone. Interviews were recorded digitally and transcribed verbatim. An inductive approach was taken to perform content analysis of interview material.Results21 interviews were performed with nine women seeking asylum in pregnancy and early motherhood. Content analysis of women's perceived health-related needs revealed significant health challenges due to considerable constraints in two major themes each with associated categories: a) material circumstances and b) behavioural factors. Participants' experiences of living conditions included significant challenges in terms of housing and neighbourhood quality e.g. poor hygiene standards with fear of disease and restless sleep due to threats of violence. Consumption potential was severely limited because of a minimal living allowance. Food was a major preoccupation for all participants. Catering services in state-provided accommodation were perceived as unsatisfactory and neglecting religious practices. Institutional food provided adequate calorific intake but participants reported loss of appetite due to bland food, limited variety, little choice and unfamiliar tastes. Self-catering was prohibited further exacerbating this problem.ConclusionsPregnant asylum seekers and new mothers living in state-provided accommodation experienced major restrictions related to material circumstances in this study. Key results identified housing and neighbourhood quality, consumption potential and nutrition as social determinants of health which women perceived to adversely affect their health, especially during pregnancy and early motherhood.

AB BackgroundState and Territorial Health Departments (SHDs) have a unique role in protecting and promoting workers' health. This mixed-methods study presents the first systematic investigation of SHDs' activities and capacity in both Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) and Workplace Health Promotion (WHP) in the United States (US).MethodsNational survey of OSH and WHP practitioners from each of 56 SHDs, followed by in-depth interviews with a subset of survey respondents. We calculated descriptive statistics for survey variables and conducted conventional content analysis of interviews.ResultsSeventy percent (n=39) of OSH and 71% (n=40) of WHP contacts responded to the survey. Twenty-seven (n=14 OSH, n=13 WHP) participated in follow-up interviews. Despite limited funding, staffing, or organizational support, SHDs reported a wide array of activities. We assessed OSH and WHP surveillance activities, support that SHDs provided to employers to implement OSH and WHP interventions (implementation support), OSH and WHP services provided directly to workers, OSH follow-back investigations, and OSH standard and policy development. Each of the categories we asked about (excluding OSH standard and policy development) were performed by more than half of responding SHDs. Surveillance was the area of greatest OSH activity, while implementation support was the area of greatest WHP activity. Respondents characterized their overall capacity as low. Thirty percent (n=9) of WHP and 19% (n=6) of OSH respondents reported no funds at all for OSH/WHP work, and both groups reported a median 1.0 FTEs working on OSH/WHP at the SHD. Organizational support for OSH and WHP was characterized as low to moderate.To increase SHDs' capacity for OSH and WHP, interview respondents recommended that OSH and WHP approaches be better integrated into other public health initiatives (e.g., infectious disease prevention), and that federal funding for OSH and WHP increase. They also discussed specific recommendations for improving the accessibility and utility of existing funding mechanisms, and the educational resources they desired from the CDC.ConclusionsResults revealed current activities and specific strategies for increasing capacity of SHDs to promote the safety and health of workers and workplaces - an important public health setting for reducing acute injury and chronic disease.

AB BackgroundPrevention of childhood obesity is a public health priority. Interventions that establish healthy growth trajectories early in life promise lifelong benefits to health and wellbeing. Proactive Assessment of Obesity Risk during Infancy (ProAsk) is a novel mHealth intervention designed to enable health professionals to assess an infant's risk of future overweight and motivate parental behaviour change to prevent childhood overweight and obesity. The aim of this study was to explore parents' and health professionals' experiences of the overweight risk communication and behaviour change aspects of this mHealth intervention.MethodsThe study was conducted in four economically deprived localities in the UK. Parents (N=66) were recruited to the ProAsk feasibility study when their infant was 6-8weeks old. Twenty two health visitors (HVs) used a hand-held tablet device to deliver ProAsk to parents when their infants were 3months old. Parents (N=12) and HVs (N=15) were interviewed when infants in the study were 6months old. Interview data were transcribed and analysed thematically using an inductive, interpretative approach.ResultsFour key themes were identified across both parent and health visitor data: Engaging and empowering with digital technology; Unfamiliar technology presents challenges and opportunity; Trust in the risk score; Resistance to targeting. Most participants found the interactivity and visual presentation of information on ProAsk engaging. Health visitors who were unfamiliar with mobile technology drew support from parents who were more confident using tablet devices. There was evidence of resistance to targeting infants at greatest risk of future overweight and obesity, and both parents and health visitors drew on a number of reasons why a higher than average overweight risk score might not apply to a particular infant.ConclusionsAn mHealth intervention actively engaged parents, enabling them to take ownership of the process of seeking strategies to reduce infant risk of overweight. However, cognitive and motivational biases that prevent effective overweight risk communication are barriers to targeting an intervention at those infants most at risk.Trial registrationNCT02314494.

TI Stock-outs of antiretroviral and tuberculosis medicines in South Africa:
   A national cross-sectional survey
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CAPE PROVINCE
AB Background
   HIV and TB programs have rapidly scaled-up over the past decade in Sub-Saharan Africa and uninterrupted supplies of those medicines are critical to their success. However, estimates of stock-outs are largely unknown. This survey aimed to estimate the extent of stock-outs of antiretroviral and TB medicines in public health facilities across South Africa, which has the world's largest antiretroviral treatment (ART) program and a rising multidrug-resistant TB epidemic.
   Methods
   We conducted a cross-sectional telephonic survey (October-December 2015) of public health facilities. Facilities were asked about the prevalence of stock-outs on the day of the survey and in the preceding three months, their duration and impact.
   Results
   Nationwide, of 3547 eligible health facilities, 79% (2804) could be reached telephonically. 88% (2463) participated and 4% (93) were excluded as they did not provide ART or TB treatment. Of the 2370 included facilities, 20% (485) reported a stock-out of at least 1 ARV and/or TB-related medicine on the day of contact and 36% (864) during the three months prior to contact, ranging from 74% (163/220) of health facilities in Mpumalanga to 12% (32/261) in the Western Cape province. These 864 facilities reported 1475 individual stock-outs, with one to fourteen different medicines out of stock per facility. Information on impact was provided in 98% (1449/1475) of stock-outs: 25% (366) resulted in a high impact outcome, where patients left the facility without medicine or were provided with an incomplete regimen. Of the 757 stock-outs that were resolved 70% (527) lasted longer than one month.
   Interpretation
   There was a high prevalence of stock-outs nationwide. Large interprovincial differences in stock-out occurrence, duration, and impact suggest differences in provincial ability to prevent, mitigate and cope within the same framework. End-user monitoring of the supply chain by patients and civil society has the potential to increase transparency and complement public sector monitoring systems.

TI Accounting for long-term manifestations of Cryptosporidium spp infection

   (2013-2017)
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID HOMINIS INFECTION; OUTBREAK; PATHOGENS; COMMUNITY; SYMPTOMS; DALYS; RISK
AB Background
   Burden of disease (BoD) estimations are increasingly used to prioritize public health interventions. Previous Cryptosporidium BoD models accounted only for acute episodes, while there is increasing evidence of long-term manifestations. Our objective was to update Cryptosporidium BoD and cost-of-illness (COI) models and to estimate BoD and COI for the Netherlands in years 2013-2017.
   Methods
   We performed a scoping literature review and drew an outcome tree including long-term manifestations for which sufficient evidence was found, such as recurrent diarrhea and joint pain. We chose the Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) metric to synthesize years of life lost due mortality (YLLs) and years lived with disability due to non-fatal outcomes (YLDs). For the costs, we adopted a societal perspective accounting for direct healthcare costs, patient costs and productivity losses. Uncertainty was managed using Latin Hypercube sampling (30,000 iterations).
   Results
   In the Netherlands in 2017, we estimated 50,000 Cryptosporidium cases (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 15,000-102,000), 7,000 GP visits, 300 hospitalizations and 3 deaths, resulting in 137 DALYs (95% UI: 54-255) and (sic)19.2 million COI (95% UI: (sic)7.2 million-(sic)36.2 million). Estimates were highest for 2016 (218 DALYs and (sic)31.1 million in COI), and lowest in 2013 (100 DALYs and (sic)13.8 million in COI). Most of the BoD was attributable to YLD (approximate to 80% of DALYs). The most important cost was productivity losses (approximate to 90% of total COI). Long-term manifestations, including recurring diarrhea and joint pain, accounted for 9% of the total DALYs and 7% of the total COI.

   PERCEPTIONS; EXPERIENCES; INNOVATION; CHALLENGE; STAFF
AB Background
   The Healthy Living Pharmacy (HLP) project, launched in England, UK in 2009 was a novel approach of introducing public health services within community pharmacy to tackle local health inequalities. A national roll-out followed a reported successful pilot; subsequent local evaluations ensued.
   Objectives
   To summarise reported outcomes and investigate contextual factors that indicate the presence, absence and maturity of implementation determinants, thus offering useful lessons to stakeholders in implementing future initiatives to achieve successful outcomes.
   Methods
   A systematic review was conducted to identify all publications reporting on the HLP project. All HLP articles and conference abstracts were considered for inclusion and were assessed for methodological quality. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was utilised to identify potential implementation determinants reported. Each article was then analysed to identify reported economic, humanistic or clinical outcomes.
   Results
   The review included six peer-reviewed journal articles and 12 conference abstracts. Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument indicated deficiencies in methodological quality. Through adoption of the CFIR framework, the implementation determinants relevant to the implementation of HLP into community pharmacy were identified. A resonating issue emerged in that the absence of adopting an evidence-based implementation process limited the ability to capture meaningful outcome data. This resulted in a lack of evidence to support sustainability and the failure to address many of the well cited barriers, e. g. lack of awareness amongst patients, public and other healthcare professionals, and weak support for future investment in resource for training and dissemination.
   Conclusions
   Healthcare systems are increasingly called on to adopt evidence-based interventions that improve quality, control costs, and maximize value, thus offering opportunity to accelerate the implementation of clinical pharmacy services and programs aimed at improving patient care. Interventions, such as the HLP project require focused efforts on implementation and evaluation of those implementation efforts to produce effective and lasting changes in complex health care systems.

AB Our objective was to present the findings of an opt-in, school-based eye care service for children attending 11 special schools in England and use these findings to determine whether a vision screening programme would be appropriate for this population. Data from eye examinations provided to 949 pupils (mean age 10.7 years) was analysed to determine the prevalence and aetiology of visual deficiencies and reported eye care history. For 46.2% (n = 438) of pupils, a visual deficiency was recorded. 12.5% of all the children seen (n = 119) had a visual deficiency that was previously undiagnosed. Referral for a medical opinion was made for 3.1% (n = 29) of pupils seen by the service. Spectacle correction was needed for 31.5% (n = 299) of pupils; for 12.9% (122) these were prescribed for the first time. 3.7% (n = 11) of parents/carers of pupils needing spectacles chose not to use the spectacle dispensing service offered in school. Eye care history was available for 847 pupils (89.3%). Of the pupils for whom an eye care history was available, 44% (n = 373) reported no history of any previous eye care and10.7% (n = 91) reported a history of attending a community optical practice/opticians. Only one pupil from the school entry 4-5 age group (0.6% of age group n = 156) would have passed vision screening using current Public Health England screening guidelines. Children with a diagnosis of autism were significantly less likely to be able to provide a reliable measurement of visual acuity. This study supports previously published evidence of a very high prevalence of visual problems in children with the most complex needs and a significant unmet need in this group. It demonstrates routine school entry vision screening using current Public Health England guidelines is not appropriate for this group of children and very low uptake of community primary eye care services.

TI Relationship between Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) and

   Sub-Saharan Africa and public health implications: A systematic review
SO PLOS ONE

DT Review
ID BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS; HIGH-RISK; HIV; GENOTYPES; CANCERS; DISEASE
AB Invasive cervical cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women in Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) emitted recommendations to start Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) regardless of CD4 count. Although HAART has been shown to reduce the prevalence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) genotypes, it is unclear whether it confers a protective effect specifically for HPV 16. This review summarizes the existing evidence regarding the effect of HAART on HPV 16 infection, as this genotype may not be influenced by immunity level and explores its implications for Sub Saharan Africa. A comprehensive literature review was undertaken and quality assessment was carried out on the selected papers. Four cohort studies and three cross-sectional studies were identified for which the overall quality score assessment ranged from weak/moderate (Score of 1.8) to strong (Score of 3). The evidence yielded by our review was conflicting. Thus, the high heterogeneity between study populations and results did not allow us to draw any firm conclusions as to whether HAART has an impact on HPV 16 acquisition/prevalence. As only three studies were conducted in Africa, there are insufficient grounds for solid comparison between geographic regions. In light of inadequate data, HPV unvaccinated women on HAART should still receive more frequent follow-up.

TI Inequitable coverage of vitamin A supplementation in Nigeria and
   implications for childhood blindness
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH

AB BackgroundVitamin A deficiency (VAD) is of major public health significance; it is a risk factor for childhood deaths from diarrhoea and measles in low and middle-income countries and an important cause of preventable childhood blindness in low income countries. Vitamin A supplementation (VAS) is being implemented in many LMICs and high coverage reduces the prevalence of blinding corneal diseases in children. However, national estimates of coverage may not reveal any inequities in intra country coverage. The aim of this study is to assess factors influencing VAS coverage and also assess the relationship between VAS coverage and childhood corneal blindness in Nigeria.MethodsData were collected from the Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) 2013 and the published literature on population-based childhood blindness surveys in Nigeria. The main outcome measure was the proportion of eligible children who received VAS in the last 6months preceding the survey. Study factors comprised a range of socioeconomic, and individual factors. Data were analysed using STATA V.12.1 (Statcorp, Texas). To explore the effects of the independent variables on VAS coverage, bivariate and multivariate regression was done. Variables with p<0.05 in the final multivariable model were considered as independent factors. For the population-based childhood blindness surveys, aggregated and disaggregated data were used. Causes of blindness were stratified into corneal blindness and others'. Odds ratios were computed to determine the odds of developing corneal blindness in each geopolitical region. Tests of significance were set at the 95% level.ResultsThe total VAS coverage in 2013 was 41.5%. VAS coverage was inequitable. Children with very educated mothers (OR 3.27 p<0.001), from the south-south region (OR 2.38 p<0.001) or in the highest wealth quintile (OR 2.81 p<0.001) had higher odds of receiving VAS. The northwest zone had the lowest VAS coverage and the highest prevalence of corneal blindness.ConclusionRegional and socioeconomic inequities in VAS exist in Nigeria and these may have grave implications for the causes of childhood blindness. The development and implementation of context specific and effective strategies are needed to reduce these inequities in VAS.

AB BackgroundWhile supervised injection services (SIS) feasibility research has been conducted in large urban centres across North America, it is unknown whether these services are acceptable among people who inject drugs (PWID) in remote, mid-size cities. We assessed willingness to use SIS and expected frequency of SIS use among PWID in Thunder Bay, a community in Northwestern, Ontario, Canada, serving people from suburban, rural and remote areas of the region.MethodsBetween June and October 2016, peer research associates administered surveys to PWID. Sociodemographic characteristics, drug use and behavioural patterns associated with willingness to use SIS and expected frequency of SIS use were estimated using bivariable and multivariable logistic regression models. Design preferences and amenities identified as important to provide alongside SIS were assessed descriptively.ResultsAmong 200 PWID (median age, IQR: 35, 28-43; 43% female), 137 (69%) reported willingness to use SIS. In multivariable analyses, public injecting was positively associated with willingness to use (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 4.15; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.08-8.29). Among those willing to use SIS, 87 (64%) said they would always/usually use SIS, while 48 (36%) said they would sometime/occasionally use SIS. In multivariable analyses, being female (AOR: 2.44; 95% CI: 1.06-5.65) and reporting injecting alone was positively associated with higher expected frequency of use (AOR: 2.59; 95% CI: 1.02-6.58).ConclusionsOur findings suggest that SIS could play a role in addressing the harms of injection drug use in remote and mid-sized settings particularly for those who inject in public, as well as women and those who inject alone, who report higher expected frequency of SIS use. Design preferences of local PWID, in addition to differences according to gender should be taken into consideration to maximize the uptake of SIS, alongside existing health and social service provisions available to PWID.

TI Prevalence and correlates of anemia among children aged 6-23 months in
   Wolaita Zone, Southern Ethiopia
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID IRON-DEFICIENCY ANEMIA; HEALTH
AB Background
   Anemia, the world's most common micro-nutrient deficiency disorder, can affect a person at any time and at all stages of life. Though all members of the community may face the problem, children aged 6-23 months are particularly at higher risk. If left untreated, it adversely affects the health, cognitive development, school achievement, and work performance. However, little was investigated among young children in Sub-Saharan countries including Ethiopia. This research aimed to investigate its magnitude and correlates to address the gap and guide design of evidence based intervention.
   Methods
   A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from May -June 2016 in rural districts of Wolaita Zone. Multi-stage sampling technique was applied and 990 mother-child pairs were selected. Socio-demography, health and nutritional characteristics were collected by administering interview questionnaire to mothers/care-givers. Blood samples were taken to diagnose anemia by using HemoCue device, and the status was determined using cut-offs used for children aged 6-59 months. Hemoglobin concentration below 11.0 g/dl was considered anemic. Data were analyzed with Stata V14. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regressions were applied to identify candidates and predictor variables respectively. Statistical significance was determined at p-value < 0.05 at 95% confidence interval.
   Results
   The mean hemoglobin level of children was 10.44 +/- 1.3g/dl, and 65.7% of them were anemic. Among anemic children, 0.4% were severely anemic (<7.0g/dl), while 28.1% and 37.2% were mildly (10.0-10.9g/dl) and moderately (7.0-9.9g/dl) anemic, respectively. In the multivariable analysis, having maternal age of 35 years and above (AOR = 1.96), being government employee (AOR = 0.29), being merchant (AOR = 0.43) and 'other' occupation (AOR = 3.17) were correlated with anemia in children in rural Wolaita. Similarly, receiving anti- helminthic drugs (AOR = 0.39), being female child (AOR = 1.76), consuming poor dietary diversity (AOR = 1.40), and having moderate household food insecurity (AOR = 1.72) were associated with anemia in rural Wolaita.
   Conclusion
   A large majority of children in the rural Wolaita were anemic and the need for proven public health interventions such as food diversification, provision of anti-helminthic drugs and ensuring household food security is crucial. In addition, educating women on nutrition and diet diversification, as well as engaging them with alternative sources of income might be interventions in the study area.

TI Is there a fundamental flaw in Canada's post-arrival immigrant
   surveillance system for tuberculosis?

DT Article
ID LOW-INCIDENCE COUNTRIES; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY
   TUBERCULOSIS; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; RISK; EPIDEMIOLOGY; RECOMMENDATIONS;
   IDENTIFICATION; MIGRANTS; HISTORY
AB Background
   New immigrants to Canada with a history of tuberculosis or evidence of old healed tuberculosis on chest radiograph are referred to public health authorities for medical surveillance. This ostensible public health protection measure identifies a subgroup of patients (referrals) who are at very low risk (compared to non-referrals) of transmission.
   Methods
   To assess whether earlier diagnosis or a different phenotypic expression of disease explains this difference, we systematically reconstructed the immigration and transmission histories from a well-defined cohort of recently-arrived referral and non-referral pulmonary tuberculosis cases in Canada. Incident case chest radiographs in all cases and sequential past radiographs in referrals were re-read by three experts. Change in disease severity from pre-immigration radiograph to incident radiograph was the primary, and transmission of tuberculosis, the secondary, outcome.
   Results
   There were 174 cohort cases; 61 (35.1%) referrals and 113 (64.9%) non-referrals. Compared to non-referrals, referrals were less likely to be symptomatic (26% vs. 80%), smearpositive (15% vs. 50%), or to have cavitation (0% vs. 35%) or extensive disease (15% vs. 59%) on chest radiograph. After adjustment for referral status, time between films, country-of-birth, age and co-morbidities, referrals were less likely to have substantial changes on chest radiograph; OR 0.058 (95% CI 0.018-0.199). All secondary cases and 82% of tuberculin skin test conversions occurred in contacts of non-referrals.
   Conclusions
   Phenotypically different disease, and not earlier diagnosis, explains the difference in transmission risk between referrals and non-referrals. Screening, and treating high-risk non-referrals for latent tuberculosis is necessary to eliminate tuberculosis in Canada.

TI Preadolescent children's perception of power imbalance in bullying: A
   thematic analysis
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID VICTIMS; VICTIMIZATION; AGGRESSION; POPULARITY; VALIDITY
AB Bullying in schools is associated with an extensive public health burden. Bullying is intentional and goal oriented aggressive behavior in which the perpetrator exploits an imbalance of power to repeatedly dominate the victim. To differentiate bullying from aggressive behavior, assessment must include a valid measure of power imbalance as perceived by the victim. And yet, to date, there remains no agreement as to how to most accurately measure power imbalance among preadolescent children. This qualitative study explored children's (age 9 to 11) understanding of power imbalance through thematic analysis of focus group discussions. Subthemes that emerged as influencing power imbalance include: age of victim, peer valued characteristics, and group membership and position. Subthemes of empathy and peer valued characteristics emerged as protecting against the negative impact of power imbalance.

TI Chagas screening and treatment among Bolivians living in Madrid, Spain:
   The need for an official protocol
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID LATIN-AMERICAN MIGRANTS; DISEASE; WOMEN
AB Background
   It is estimated that around 52,000 people live with Chagas in Spain, but only 10% have been diagnosed. Migrants from Bolivia bear the burden of Chagas infection in Spain. However, little is known about their current management of Chagas diagnosis and treatment patterns. This study aimed to assess the Chagas related disease perception and health behaviour of Bolivians living in Madrid.
   Methods and principal findings
   For a first time, a cross-sectional survey about Chagas' knowledges and practices was carried out in Madrid, Spain. A total of 376 Bolivians were interviewed about their Chagas health-seeking behaviour. Differences between men and women were assessed Most of Bolivians living in Madrid have access to the public health services. 44% of Bolivians included in the survey had a Chagas screening test done. However, while women did their test for Chagas mostly at hospital (59.2%), men also used the community campaigns (17.5%) and blood banks (14.3%). The prevalence reported among Bolivians tested was 27.7%. Unfortunately, more than half of those reporting a positive test for Chagas did not begin or completed treatment. Only 45.7% of positives reported having had their children tested for Chagas.
   Conclusions
   Despite the increase in the number of Chagas diagnoses done in Madrid, the number of Bolivians who tested positive and then started or completed treatment remains very low. The fact that most Bolivians' access to the health system is through the primary healthcare services should be considered for improving management of cases and follow-up of treatment adherence. Local and national protocol establishing guidelines for the screening and treatment of Chagas disease would help improving case detection and management at all levels of the healthcare system.

AB BackgroundImpaired maternal bonding has been associated with antenatal and postnatal factors, especially postpartum depression. Only a few population-based, longitudinal studies have examined the association between maternal depression and bonding in outside western countries. In addition, little is known about the association between psychosocial factors during pregnancy and impaired maternal bonding. The aim of this study was to investigate risk factors associated with impaired maternal bonding 3 months after delivery using Japanese population-based, longitudinal study from pregnancy period to 3 months after delivery.MethodsThis study was performed at the public health care center in Hekinan city, Aichi prefecture, Japan. Mothers who participated the infant's health check-up 3 months after delivery from July 2013 to Jun 2015 completed the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire (PBQ) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) 1 month after delivery. Information was also provided from home visit at 1 month after delivery, birth registration form, and pregnancy notification form. The study included 1060 mothers with a mean age of 29.90years, who had given birth at a mean of 38.95weeks.ResultsBivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the association between antenatal and postnatal factors and impaired maternal bonding. The main findings were that maternal negative feelings about pregnancy (OR=2.16, 95% CI=1.02-4.56) and postpartum depression at 1 month after delivery (OR=7.85, 95% CI=3.44-17.90) were associated with higher levels of impaired maternal bonding 1 months after delivery. Mothers who had delivered their first child had increased odds of a moderate level of impaired maternal bonding 3 months after delivery (OR=1.85, 95% CI=1.22-2.81).ConclusionsThe findings emphasize the importance of identifying mothers with depression and those with maternal negative feelings towards pregnancy to assess possible impaired maternal bonding.

AB BackgroundMobile health, mHealth is recognized as a strategy to improve lifestyle behaviors. Research targeting specific lifestyle behaviors has shown that interventions using smartphones can be effective. However, few studies have evaluated solutions with multicomponent interventions, tailoring the intervention to the specific needs of the participant using a combination of mHealth and conventional treatment. To accomplish this, we developed Health Integrator, an mHealth platform with services and offers in the areas of diet, physical activity, sleeping habits, stress, alcohol and tobacco use. In the system, the user selects an area of intervention together with a health coach and set weekly goals. This study protocol presents the design and methodology of the Health Integrator Study, a randomized controlled trial to promote improved lifestyle behaviors.MethodsA three-arm parallel randomized controlled trial (1:1:1) is conducted in the Stockholm County, Sweden. In total, 209 employees at a four different companies representing both white and blue collar workers, have been recruited.Participants are randomized to either a control group or to one of two intervention groups receiving a 3-month lifestyle behavior change program including either 1) use of Health Integrator and monthly health coaching sessions or 2) only Health Integrator.At baseline and follow-up after 3- and 6-months, all participants answer questionnaires assessing lifestyle behaviors and quality of life. At baseline and the 3-month follow-up (end of intervention period), weight, height, waist circumference and blood pressure are measured, and all participants wear an Actigraph accelerometer for 7days to assess physical activity. Blood lipid profile and HbA1c are measured among all participants at baseline. If baseline measures fall outside the normal range, a second measurement is done after 3months.DiscussionThe Health Integrator Intervention Study will evaluate if a personalized intervention combining mHealth and conventional programs for lifestyle change, with or without additional health coach sessions, can improve lifestyle behaviors and quality of life. Based on the results from this trial, Health Integrator can easily be implemented within a broad public.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03579342.

AB BackgroundEarly care and education (ECE) centers are important for combating childhood obesity. Understanding policies and practices of ECE centers is necessary for promotion of healthy behaviors. The purpose of this study is to describe self-reported practices, outdoor environment aspects, and center policies for physical activity and screen time in a statewide convenience sample of non-Head Start Texas ECE centers.MethodsLicensed home and child care centers in Texas with email addresses publicly available on the Department of Family and Protective Services website (N=6568) were invited to participate in an online survey. Descriptive statistics of self-reported practices, policies, and outdoor learning environment are described.Results827 surveys were collected (response rate=12.6%). Exclusion criteria yielded a cross-sectional sample of 481 center-only respondents. >80% of centers meet best practice recommendations for screen time practices for infants and toddlers, although written policies were low (M=1.4 policies, SD=1.65, range=0-6). For physical activity, <30% meet best practice recommendations with M=3.9 policies (SD=3.0, range=0-10) policies reported. Outdoor learning environment indicators (M=5.7 policies, SD=2.5, range=0-12) and adequate play settings, storage (<40%), and greenery (<20%) were reported.ConclusionsThis statewide convenience sample of non-Head Start Texas ECE centers shows numerous opportunities for improvement in practices and policies surrounding outdoor environments, physical activity, and screen time. With less than half of centers meeting the recommendations for physical activity and outdoor learning environments, dedicating resources to help centers enact and modify written policies and to implement programs to improve their outdoor learning environments could promote physical activity and reduce sedentary time of children.

AB BackgroundMis-implementation (i.e., the premature termination or inappropriate continuation of public health programs) contributes to the misallocation of limited public health resources and the sub-optimal response to the growing global burden of chronic disease. This study seeks to describe the occurrence of mis-implementation in four countries of differing sizes, wealth, and experience with evidence-based chronic disease prevention (EBCDP).MethodsA cross-sectional study of 400 local public health practitioners in Australia, Brazil, China, and the United States was conducted from November 2015 to April 2016. Online survey questions focused on how often mis-termination and mis-continuation occur and the most common reasons programs end and continue.ResultsWe found significant differences in knowledge of EBCDP across countries with upwards of 75% of participants from Australia (n=91/121) and the United States (n=83/101) reporting being moderately to extremely knowledgeable compared with roughly 60% (n=47/76) from Brazil and 20% (n=21/102) from China (p<0.05). Far greater proportions of participants from China thought effective programs were never mis-terminated (12.2% (n=12/102) vs. 1% (n=2/121) in Australia, 2.6% (n=2/76) in Brazil, and 1.0% (n=1/101) in the United States; p<0.05) or were unable to estimate how frequently this happened (45.9% (n=47/102) vs. 7.1% (n=7/101) in the United States, 10.5% (n=8/76) in Brazil, and 1.7% (n=2/121) in Australia; p<0.05). The plurality of participants from Australia (58.0%, n=70/121) and the United States (36.8%, n=37/101) reported that programs often mis-continued whereas most participants from Brazil (60.5%, n=46/76) and one third (n=37/102) of participants from China believed this happened only sometimes (p<0.05). The availability of funding and support from political authorities, agency leadership, and the general public were common reasons programs continued and ended across all countries. A program's effectiveness or evidence-baseor lack thereofwere rarely reasons for program continuation and termination.ConclusionsDecisions about continuing or ending a program were often seen as a function of program popularity and funding availability as opposed to effectiveness. Policies and practices pertaining to programmatic decision-making should be improved in light of these findings. Future studies are needed to understand and minimize the individual, organizational, and political-level drivers of mis-implementation.

The objective of this study was to explore the potential impact of observation cost-sharing on future medical decision making of Medicare beneficiaries.MethodsSingle-center pilot cohort study.

If hospitalized under observation status again, there was a trend among low-income beneficiaries to request completion of their workup outside of the hospital (56.3% vs 43.8%), and to consider leaving against medical advice (AMA) (100% vs 0%), though these trends were not statistically significant (p=0.30).ConclusionThe results of this pilot study suggest that low-income Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized under observation status have greater concerns about their cost-sharing obligations than their higher income peers. Cost-sharing for observation care may have unintended consequences on utilization for low-income beneficiaries. Future studies should examine this potential relationship on a larger scale.

AB The objectives of this study were to explore the goodness of fit between the bereaved peoples' needs and the support offered by their social networks; to ascertain whether this support was experienced as helpful or unhelpful by bereaved people; and to explore both the types of social networks that offer effective support and the characteristics of the communities that encourage and nurture such networks. This study was based on qualitative interviews from twenty bereaved people, in Western Australia, interviewed in 2013. A framework analysis of these interviews was undertaken using a deductive approach based on the goodness of fit framework. Much of this support is provided informally in community settings by a range of people already involved in the everyday lives of those recently bereaved; and that support can be helpful or unhelpful depending on its amount, timing, function and structure. Improving the fit between the bereaved person's needs and the support offered may thus involve identifying and enhancing the caring capacity of existing networks. An important strategy for achieving this is to train community members in mapping and developing these naturally occurring networks. Some such networks will include relationships of long standing, others may be circles of care formed during a period of caring. Peer support bereavement networks develop from these existing networks and may also recruit new members who were not part of the caring circle. The findings endorse social models of bereavement care that fit within a public health approach rather than relying solely on professional care. As exemplified by Compassionate Communities policies and practices, establishing collaboration between community networks and professional services is vital for effective and sustainable bereavement care.

AB The primary purpose of the present study was to examine the effectiveness of threat appeals in influencing impulsive decision making associated with texting while driving. The participants in the treatment group were exposed to a threatening message about the danger of texting while driving, whereas those in the control group were exposed to a nonthreatening message. Following the exposure to either message, the participants completed a delay-discounting task that assessed the degree of impulsive decision making in a hypothetical texting-while-driving scenario. A comparison between the groups revealed that the threat appeals reduced the degree of impulsive decision making associated with texting while driving. In addition, the threat appeals led to greater anticipated regret from texting while driving, less favorable attitudes toward texting while driving, and decreased intentions to text while driving in the future in the treatment group. These results suggest that video based threat appeals are promising intervention strategies for the public health challenge of texting while driving. Implications from the behavioral economic perspective are discussed.

AB Introduction
   Portugal underwent significant political, demographic and epidemiological transitions during the 20th century resulting in migration to urban areas with subsequent overcrowding and issues with water sanitation. This study investigates population health during these transitions and interprets results within a framework of recent history and present-day public health information. We investigate skeletal evidence for anemia (cribra orbitalia and porotic hyperostosis) as indicators of stress and frailty i.e., whether the lesions contribute to susceptibility for disease or increased risk of death.
   Methods
   The presence and severity of skeletal lesions were compared against known sex and cause of death data to investigate potential heterogeneity in frailty and the relationship between lesions and risk of dying over time. Additionally, we tested for the presence of selective mortality in our data (i.e., whether or not the sample is biased for individuals with higher frailty). Our sample derives from a large, documented, modern Portuguese collection from Lisbon and is the first study of its kind using a documented collection. The collection represents primarily middle-class individuals.
   Results and conclusions
   Analyses indicated that porotic hyperostosis became more common and severe over time, while cribra orbitalia severity increased over time. Neither process was linked to cause of death. However, there was a significant relationship to sex; males exhibited a higher prevalence and severity of lesions and increased mortality. A Gompertz function showed decreased survivorship in early life but increased survivorship over age 60. Using comorbidities of anemia, we were unable to detect selective mortality i.e., in our sample, lesions do not represent a sign of poor health or increased frailty and are not significantly linked with a decreased mean age-at-death. However, lesion prevalence and severity do reflect the socioeconomic processes in urban Lisbon during the 1800s and 1900s and the possibility of water-borne parasites as the contributing factor for iron deficiency anemia.

TI Comparative performance of four rapid Ebola antigen-detection lateral
   flow immunoassays during the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID DIAGNOSIS
AB Background
   Without an effective vaccine, as was the case early in the 2014-2016 Ebola Outbreak in West Africa, disease control depends entirely on interrupting transmission through early disease detection and prompt patient isolation. Lateral Flow Immunoassays (LFI) are a potential supplement to centralized reference laboratory testing for the early diagnosis of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD).
   The goal of this study was to assess the performance of commercially available simple and rapid antigen detection LFIs, submitted for review to the WHO via the Emergency Use Assessment and Listing procedure. The study was performed in an Ebola Treatment Centre laboratory involved in EVD testing in Sierra Leone. Findings
   In light of the current Ebola outbreak in May 2018 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which highlights the lack of clarity in the global health community about appropriate Ebola diagnostics, our findings are increasingly critical.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess comparative performance of four LFIs for detecting EVD. LFIs were assessed against the same 328 plasma samples and 100 whole EDTA blood samples, using the altona RealStar Filovirus Screen real-time RT-PCR as the bench mark assay. The performance of the Public Health England (PHE) in-house Zaire ebolavirus-specific real time RT-PCR Trombley assay was concurrently assessed. Statistical analysis using generalized estimating equations was conducted to compare LFI performance.
   Findings
   Sensitivity and specificity varied between the LFIs, with specificity found to be significantly higher for whole EDTA blood samples compared to plasma samples in at least 2 LFIs (P<0.003). Using the altona RT-PCR assay as the bench mark, sensitivities on plasma samples ranged from 79.53% (101/127, 95% CI: 71.46-86.17%) for the DEDIATEST EBOLA (SD Biosensor) to 98.43% (125/127, 95% CI: 94.43-99.81%) for the One step Ebola test (Intec). Specificities ranged from 80.20% (158/197, 95% CI: 74.07-88.60%) for plasma samples using the ReEBOV Antigen test Kit (Corgenix) to 100.00% (98/98, 95% CI: 96.31-100.00%) for whole blood samples using the DEDIATEST EBOLA (SD Biosensor) and SD Ebola Zaire Ag (SD Biosensor). Results also showed the Trombley RT-PCR assay had a lower limit of detection than the altona assay, with some LFIs having higher sensitivity than the altona assay when the Trombley assay was the bench mark.
   Interpretation
   All of the tested EVD LFIs may be considered suitable for use in an outbreak situation (i.e. rule out testing in communities), although they had variable performance characteristics, with none possessing both high sensitivity and specificity. The non-commercial Trombley Zaire ebolavirus RT-PCR assay warrants further investigation, as it appeared more sensitive than the current gold standard, the altona Filovirus Screen RT-PCR assay.

AB BackgroundBovine brucellosis is a zoonotic disease that causes substantial economic losses and has a strong impact on public health. The main objective of this paper is to determine the risk factors for new infections of Brucella abortus on Colombian cattle farms previously certified as being free of brucellosis. A case-control study was conducted by comparing 98 cases (farms certified as brucellosis-free for three or more years but became infected) with 93 controls (farms that remained brucellosis-free during at least the previous three years). The farms were matched by herd size and geographical location (municipality). Information was obtained via a questionnaire completed by veterinary officers through a personal interview with the herd owners.ResultsTwo-thirds of the herds (67%) were dairy herds, 16% were beef herds, and 17% were dual-purpose (beef and milk) herds. After exploratory univariate analysis, all explanatory variables with a p-value of 0.20 were included in a logistic regression model using the forward stepwise method to select the model with the best goodness of fit. The significant risk factors were the replacement of animals from farms not certified as brucellosis-free compared to replacement from certified brucellosis-free farms (OR=4.84, p-value <0.001) and beef cattle farms compared to dairy cattle farms (OR=3.61, p-value=0.017). When herds with and without artificial insemination were compared, it was observed that farms that used natural breeding with bulls from non-certified herds had a higher risk than farms using artificial insemination (OR=2.45, p-value=0.037), but when the bulls came from brucellosis-free farms, farms with natural breeding were less affected (OR=0.30, p-value=0.004) than farms using artificial insemination, whether with frozen semen from certified brucellosis-free herds or fresh semen from uncontrolled herds. The latter is commonly sold to neighbouring farms.ConclusionsThe government should make efforts to inform farmers about the risks involved in the introduction of semen and replacement heifers from farms that are not certified as brucellosis-free and to establish measures to control these practices.

AB BackgroundUnderstanding reasons for and impact of women's toileting behaviors on bladder health is important to prevent and manage urinary incontinence (UI) and overactive bladder (OAB).MethodsWomen, regardless of urinary incontinence (UI) and overactive bladder (OAB) status, were recruited in Pennsylvania and North Carolina. Focus groups were conducted by trained female moderators and sessions were audiotaped. Participants completed an anonymous questionnaire containing validated items to determine the presence of UI and OAB. Audiotapes were transcribed and content was analyzed by two investigators to identify themes.ResultsTwenty-four women participated (mean age 6813.4years); most had UI (75%) or OAB (87.5%). Many women had difficulty in describing bladder health, and talked about bladder function, diseases or conditions, and control over the bladder. Four themes about toileting emerged: 1) cues/triggers/alerts women used to find and use toilets, 2) toilet cleanliness away from and at home, 3) toileting as a nuisance, and 4) situational awareness. Women described internal (e.g., sensation of heaviness) and external cues/triggers/alerts (e.g., walking by restrooms), and the trade-off between their concerns about public toilet cleanliness and the need to urinate. Some women expressed being irritated or annoyed about having to stop activities to urinate. Most women reported sitting on their home toilets, whereas, many hovered or stood over the toilet in public places.Conclusionse information gained from this study will facilitate the development of relevant public health messaging and interventions to raise public awareness about UI, OAB, and bladder health with the aim to encourage women to seek help when symptoms are present.

ID MELLITUS
AB BackgroundMany countries are facing overlapping epidemics of tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes mellitus (DM). Diabetes increases the overall risk of developing Tuberculosis (TB) and contributes to adverse treatment outcomes. Active screening for both diseases can reduce TB transmission and prevent the development of complications of DM. We investigated bi-directional TB-DM screening in Karachi, Pakistan, a country that ranks fifth among high TB burden countries, and has the seventh highest country burden for DM.MethodsBetween February to November 2014, community-based screeners identified presumptive TB and DM through verbal screening at private health clinics. Individuals with presumptive TB were referred for a chest X-ray and Xpert MTB/RIF. Presumptive DM cases had random blood glucose (RBS) tested. All individuals with bacteriologically positive TB were referred for diabetes testing (RBS). All pre-diabetics and diabetics were referred for a chest X-ray and Xpert MTB/RIF test. The primary outcomes of this study were uptake of TB and DM testing.ResultsA total of 450,385 individuals were screened, of whom 18,109 had presumptive DM and 90,137 had presumptive TB. 14,550 of these individuals were presumptive for both DM and TB. The uptake of DM testing among those with presumptive diabetes was 26.1% while the uptake of TB testing among presumptive TB cases was 5.9%. Despite efforts to promote bi-directional screening of TB and DM, the uptake of TB testing among pre-diabetes and diabetes cases was only 4.7%, while the uptake of DM testing among MTB positive cases was 21.8%.ConclusionWhile a high yield for TB was identified among pre-diabetics and diabetics along with a high yield of DM among individuals diagnosed with TB, there was a low uptake of TB testing amongst presumptive TB patients who were recorded as pre-diabetic or diabetic. Bi-directional screening for TB and DM which includes the integration of TB diagnostics, DM screening and TB-DM treatment within existing health care programs will need to address the operational challenges identified before implementing this as a strategy in public health programs.

AB Background
   Food insecurity and violence are two major public health issues facing U.S. women. The link between food insecurity and violence has received little attention, particularly regarding the temporal ordering of events. The present study used data from the Women's Interagency Human Immunodeficiency Virus Study to investigate the longitudinal association of food insecurity and violence in a cohort of women at risk for or living with HIV.
   Methods
   Study participants completed six assessments from 2013-16 on food insecurity (operationalized as marginal, low, and very low food security) and violence (sexual or physical, and psychological). We used multi-level logistic regression, controlling for visits (level 1) nested within individuals (level 2), to estimate the association of experiencing violence.
   Results
   Among 2,343 women (8,528 visits), we found that victims of sexual or physical violence (odds ratio = 3.10; 95% confidence interval: 1.88, 5.19) and psychological violence (odds ratio = 3.00; 95% confidence interval: 1.67, 5.50) were more likely to report very low food security. The odds of experiencing violence were higher for women with very low food security at both the current and previous visit as compared to only the current visit. HIV status did not modify these associations.
   Conclusions
   Food insecurity was strongly associated with violence, and women exposed to persistent food insecurity were even more likely to experience violence. Food programs and policy must consider persistent exposure to food insecurity, and interpersonal harms faced by food insecure women, such as violence.

AB Since past century, vector-borne diseases have been a major public health concern in several states of Mexico. However, Mexico City continues to be free of endemic mosquito-borne viral diseases. The city is the most important politic and economic state of Mexico and one of the most important city of Latin America. Its subtropical highland climate and high elevation (2240 masl) had historically made the occurrence of Aedes species unlikely. However, the presence of other potential disease vectors (Culex spp, Culiseta spp), and the current intermittent introductions of Aedes aegypti, have revealed that control programs must adopt routine vector surveillance in the city. In this study, we provide an updated species list from a five-years of vector surveillance performed in Mexico City. A total of 18,553 mosquito larvae were collected. Twenty-two species from genus Culex, Aedes, Culiseta, Anopheles, Lutzia and Uranotaenia were observed. Nine new mosquito records for the city were found. Ae. albopictus was recorded for the first time in Mexico City. Interestingly, a new record, Ae. epactius was the most frequent species reported. Cx. pipiens quinquefasciatus exhibited the highest number of individuals collected. We detected six areas which harbor the highest mosquito species records in the city. Cemeteries included 68.9% of our collection sites. Temporarily ponds showed the highest species diversity. We detected an increasing presence of Ae. aegypti, which was detected for three consecutive years (2015-2017), predominantly in the warmer microclimates of the city. We found a possible correlation between increasing temperature and Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus expanding range. This study provides a starting point for developing strategies related to environmental management for mosquito control. The promotion of mosquito control practices through community participation, mass media and education programmes in schools should be introduced in the city.

TI Psychological factors and premenstrual syndrome: A Spanish case-control
   study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID STRESS; WOMEN; SYMPTOMS; PERSONALITY; DIAGNOSIS; DISORDER; HEALTH
AB Objective
   To assess whether the psychological variables perceived stress, neuroticism and coping strategies, are associated with Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) and Premenstrual Dysphoric Syndrome (PMDD).
   Design
   Case-control study with incident cases using the Spanish public healthcare system.
   Setting
   3 major public hospitals and one family counseling and planning center.
   Population
   Women consulting for troubles related to menstruation and for other motives such as screening for uterine cancer, contraception counselling or desire for pregnancy.
   Methods
   Logistic regression.
   Main outcome measures
   Odds of PMS and PMDD.
   Results
   285 PMS and 285 age-matched controls, as well as 88 PMDD cases and 176 controls participated in the study. Medium and high levels of perceived stress were associated with an increase in the odds of PMS (Odds Ratio (OR) = 2.49; 95% CI: 1.41-4.39 and OR = 4.90; 95% CI: 2.70-8.89, respectively). For PMDD the results were: OR = 2.61; 95% CI: 1.35-5.05 and OR = 5.79; 95% CI: 2.63-12.76, respectively.
   Subjects with medium and high levels of neuroticism were also at higher odds of suffering from PMS (OR = 2.53; 95% CI: 1.06-6.06 and OR = 8.05; 95% CI: 3.07-2.12, respectively).
   For PMDD, the results were OR = 3.70; 95% CI: 1.27-10.77 and 5.73: 95% CI: 1.96-16.77, respectively.
   High levels in the large majority of coping strategies were also associated with increased odds of PMS and PMDD.
   Conclusions
   Psychological factors including perceived stress, neuroticism and coping strategies are strongly related to PMS/PMDD. This association is unlikely to be due to confounding or misclassification bias. A reverse causation process cannot be ruled out although its likelihood is remote.

AB Cervical cancer, caused by high oncogenic risk Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection, continues to be a public health problem, mainly in developing countries. Using peptide phage display as a tool to identify potential molecular targets in HPV associated tumors, we identified a-mannosidase, among other enriched sequences. This enzyme is expressed in both tumor and inflammatory compartment of the tumor microenvironment. Several studies in experimental models have shown that its inhibition by swainsonine (SW) led to inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis directly and indirectly, through activation of macrophages and NK cells, promoting anti-tumor activity. Therefore, the aim of this work was to test if swainsonine treatment could modulate anti-tumor immune responses and therefore interfere in HPV associated tumor growth. Validation of our biopanning results showed that cervical tumors, both tumor cells and leukocytes, expressed a-mannosidase. Ex vivo experiments with tumor associated macrophages showed that SW could partially modulate macrophage phenotype, decreasing CCL2 secretion and impairing IL-10 and IL-6 upregulation, which prompted us to proceed to in vivo tests. However, in vivo, SW treatment increased tumor growth. Investigation of the mechanisms leading to this result showed that SW treatment significantly induced the accumulation of myeloid derived suppressor cells in the spleen of tumor bearing mice, which inhibited T cell activation. Our results suggested that SW contributes to cervical cancer progression by favoring proliferation and accumulation of myeloid cells in the spleen, thus exacerbating these tumors systemic effects on the immune system, therefore facilitating tumor growth.

TI In-silico pre-clinical trials are made possible by a new simple and
   comprehensive lumbar belt mechanical model based on the Law of Laplace
   including support deformation and adhesion effects
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Lower back pain is a major public health problem. Despite claims that lumbar belts change spinal posture due to applied pressure on the trunk, no mechanical model has yet been published to prove this treatment. This paper describes a first model for belt design, based on the one hand on the mechanical properties of the fabrics and the belt geometry, and on the other hand on the trunk geometrical and mechanical description. The model provides the estimation of the pressure applied to the trunk, and a unique indicator of the belt mechanical efficiency is proposed: pressure is integrated into a bending moment characterizing the belt delordosing action on the spine. A first in-silico clinical study of belt efficiency for 15 patients with 2 different belts was conducted. Results are very dependent on the body shape: in the case of high BMI patients, the belt effect is significantly decreased, and can be even inverted, increasing the lordosis. The belt stiffness proportionally increases the pressure applied to the trunk, but the influence of the design itself on the bending moment is clearly outlined. Moreover, the belt/trunk interaction, modeled as sticking contact and the specific way patients lock their belts, dramatically modifies the belt action. Finally, even if further developments and tests are still necessary, the model presented in this paper seems suitable for in-silico pre-clinical trials on real body shapes at a design stage.

TI Improved calibration estimators for the total cost of health programs
   and application to immunization in Brazil
SO PLOS ONE

ID ROUTINE IMMUNIZATION
AB Multi-stage/level sampling designs have been widely used by survey statisticians as a means of obtaining reliable and efficient estimates at a reasonable implementation cost. This method has been particularly useful in National country-wide surveys to assess the costs of delivering public health programs, which are generally originated in different levels of service management and delivery. Unbiased and efficient estimates of costs are essential to adequately allocate resources and inform policy and planning. In recent years, the global health community has become increasingly interested in estimating the costs of immunization programs. In such programs, part of the cost correspond to vaccines and it is in most countries procured at the central level, while the rest of the costs are incurred in states, municipalities and health facilities, respectively. As such, total program cost is a result of adding these costs, and its variance should account for the relation between the totals at the different levels. An additional challenge is the missing information at the various levels. A variety of methods have been developed to compensate for this missing data. Weighting adjustments are often used to make the estimates consistent with readily-available information. For estimation of total program costs this implies adjusting the estimates at each level to comply with the characteristics of the country. In 2014, A National study to estimate the costs of the Brazilian National Immunization Program was initiated, requested by the Ministry of Health and with the support of international partners. We formulate a quick and useful way to compute the variance and deal with missing values at the various levels. Our approach involves calibrating the weights at each level using additional readily-available information such as the total number of doses administered. Taking the Brazilian immunization costing study as an example, this approach results in substantial gains in both efficiency and precision of the cost estimate.

AB BackgroundStigma in health services may be detrimental to health seeking attitudes and practices. This study investigates non-disclosure of sex work to health care providers among female sex workers (FSW) in Brazil and its association with the utilization of health care services.MethodsThis study used cross-sectional respondent-driven sampling, carried out in 12 Brazilian cities to identify HIV risk behaviors among FSW. We first assessed statistical associations of sociodemographic, human right violations, health service access and utilization, and discrimination variables with non-disclosure of FSW status to health care providers as outcome. Secondly, we investigated the association of non-disclosure of FSW status with selected preventive health care outcomes: HIV testing, PAP smear exam, and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals were calculated by multivariable logistic regressions.ResultsAmong 4245 recruited FSW, a high percentage received free condoms (82%) but only 24.4% were counseled on STI. Most FSW used non-specialized public healthcare routinely (62.6%), but only 51.5% had a Pap smear exam in the last two years and less than 40% were tested for HIV in the last 12months. Among FSW who engaged in risky behavior (49.6%), only 8.3% used PEP. Regarding human rights violations, approximately 15% were required to give part of their earnings to owners of workplace establishments, 38% started sex work under 18years old and 6% were required to periodically present their HIV test results. 21.3% reported having faced discrimination in health services, and 24.3% always disclosed their FSW status. Multivariable logistic models indicated significant associations of non-disclosure on the four healthcare outcomes, with lower odds of using preventive health services among women who did not disclose their sex work status, even after controlling for age, educational level, NGO affiliation, and type of health care routinely used.ConclusionsOur results indicate that sex work stigmatization within health services may be one of the main barriers to STI control and HIV response among FSW. It is essential to combat stigmatization and discrimination against FSW in health services to guarantee the appropriate uptake of preventive services available in the public health system in Brazil.

AB BackgroundFemale sex workers, MSM, and transgender womencollectively referred to as key populations (KPs)are disproportionately affected by gender-based violence (GBV) and HIV, yet little is known about the violence they face, its gender-based origins, and responses to GBV. The purpose of this study was to understand the nature and consequences of GBV experienced, to inform HIV policies and programming and to help protect KPs' human rights.MethodsUsing a participatory approach, FSWs, MSM, and transgender women in Barbados, El Salvador, Trinidad and Tobago, and Haiti conducted 278 structured interviews with peers to understand their experiences of and responses to GBV. Responses to open-ended questions were coded in NVivo and analyzed using an applied thematic analysis.ResultsNearly all participants experienced some form of GBV. Emotional and economic GBV were the most commonly reported but approximately three-quarters of participants reported sexual and physical GBV and other human rights violations. The most common settings for GBV were at home, locations where sex work took place such as brothels, bars and on the street; public spaces such as parks, streets and public transport, health care centers, police stations andfor transgender women and MSMreligious settings and schools. The most common perpetrators of violence included: family, friends, peers and neighbors, strangers, intimate partners, sex work clients and other sex workers, health care workers, police, religious leaders and teachers. Consequences included emotional, physical, and sexual trauma; lack of access to legal, health, and other social services; and loss of income, employment, housing, and educational opportunities. Though many participants disclosed experiences of GBV to friends, colleagues and family, they rarely sought services following violence. Furthermore, less than a quarter of participants believed that GBV put them at risk of HIV.ConclusionsOur study found that across the four study countries, FSWs, MSM, and transgender women experienced GBV from state and non-state actors throughout their lives, and much of this violence was directly connected to rigid and harmful gender norms. Through coordinated interventions that address both HIV and GBV, this region has the opportunity to reduce the national burden of HIV while also promoting key populations' human rights.

TI Predicting resource-dependent maternal health outcomes at a referral
   hospital in Zanzibar using patient trajectories and mathematical
   modeling
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID SERVICES; CARE
AB Poor intra-facility maternity care is a major contributor to maternal mortality in low-and middle-income countries. Close to 830 women die each day due to preventable maternal complications, partly due to the increasing number of women giving birth in health facilities that are not adequately resourced to manage growing patient populations. Barriers to adequate care during the 'last mile' of healthcare delivery are attributable to deficiencies at multiple levels: education, staff, medication, facilities, and delays in receiving care. Moreover, the scope and multi-scale interdependence of these factors make individual contributions of each challenging to analyze, particularly in settings where basic data registration is often lacking. To address this need, we have designed and implemented a novel systems-level and dynamic mathematical model that simulates the impact of hospital resource allocations on maternal mortality rates at Mnazi Mmoja Hospital (MMH), a referral hospital in Zanzibar, Tanzania. The purpose of this model is to provide a rigorous and flexible tool that enables hospital administrators and public health officials to quantitatively analyze the impact of resource constraints on patient outcomes within the maternity ward, and prioritize key areas for further human or capital investment. Currently, no such tool exists to assist administrators and policy makers with effective resource allocation and planning. This paper describes the structure and construct of the model, provides validation of the assumptions made with anonymized patient data and discusses the predictive capacity of our model. Application of the model to specific resource allocations, maternal treatment plans, and hospital loads at MMH indicates through quantitative results that medicine stocking schedules and staff allocations are key areas that can be addressed to reduce mortality by up to 5-fold. With data-driven evidence provided by the model, hospital staff, administration, and the local ministries of health can enact policy changes and implement targeted interventions to improve maternal health outcomes at MMH. While our model is able to determine specific gaps in resources and health care delivery specifically at MMH, the model should be viewed as an additional tool that may be used by other facilities seeking to analyze and improve maternal health outcomes in resource constrained environments.

AB BackgroundAccess to HIV services among men who have sex with men (MSM) and female sex workers (FSWs) remains suboptimal globally. While the reasons for this dismal performance have been documented, limited evidence exists on the experiences, perceptions and readiness of health providers to provide HIV services to MSM and FSWs.MethodsThis analysis uses data collected from 48 key informants (health providers in public and private health facilities) as part of a larger study conducted in 12 districts of Uganda between October and December 2013. Data were collected on health providers' experiences and readiness to provide HIV services to MSM and FSWs and their perceptions on the effect of existing legislation on HIV services provision to MSM and FSWs. Data were captured verbatim, transcribed and analyzed following a thematic framework approach.ResultsAll health providers reported that they had ever provided HIV services to FSWs and a majority of them were comfortable serving them. However, no health provider had ever served MSM. When asked if they would be willing to serve MSM, nearly three-quarters of the health providers indicated that they would be bound by the call of duty to serve them. However, some health providers reported that they would feel very uncomfortable handling MSM because they engage in a culture imported into our country. A majority of the health providers felt that they did not have adequate skills to effectively serve MSM and called for specific training to improve their clinical skills. There were mixed reactions as to whether existing criminal laws would affect MSM or FSWs access to HIV services but there was agreement that access to HIV services, under the existing laws, would be more constrained for MSM than FSWs since society does not blame FSWs [as much as it does] with MSM.ConclusionA majority of the health providers were generally comfortable serving FSWs but there were strong homophobic tendencies towards MSM. A majority of the health providers lacked skills in how to handle MSM. Interventions aimed at improving health providers' skills in handling MSM while minimizing the negative attitude towards them are urgently needed.

AB BackgroundInternalized HIV stigma is a public health concern as it can compromise HIV prevention, care and treatment. This paper has two aims. First, it highlights the urgent need for research evidence on internalized HIV stigma based on critical knowledge gaps. Here, critical knowledge gaps were identified based on most up-to-date systematic review-level evidence on internalized stigma related to HIV and mental health difficulties. Secondly, the paper calls for a shift in focus of internalized HIV stigma research, one that moves beyond psychological frameworks to integrate social, structural and intersectional conceptualizations of stigma. This part of the paper reviews the evolution of stigma theory since Goffman's 1963 seminal work - which defined stigma - to present.Main textDespite studies consistently suggesting that internalized HIV stigma is more prevalent than enacted stigma, there is little evidence of well-established programs to address it. In addition to this, considerable gaps in basic knowledge about the drivers of internalized HIV stigma hamper the development of an evidence-based response to the problem. The limited intervention and epidemiological research on the topic treats internalized HIV stigma as a purely psychological phenomenon. The second part of the paper provides arguments for studying internalized HIV stigma as a function of social and structural forces: (1) Individual-level interventions for internalized HIV stigma are rooted in out-dated theoretical assumptions; (2) From an ethics point of view, it could be argued that individual-level interventions rely on a victim-centric approach to a public health problem; (3) Social and structural approaches to internalized HIV stigma must be explored due to the high opportunity cost associated with small-scale individual-level interventions.ConclusionsCritical gaps in intervention and epidemiological research in internalized HIV stigma remain. There has been an absence of a shared, sound theoretical understanding of internalized HIV stigma as a manifestation of social and structural factors. This commentary sought to stimulate a dialogue to remedy this absence. Future research should take into account ethical considerations, the evolution of stigma theory over the past five decades, intersectionality and opportunity cost when framing hypotheses, developing theories of change and designing interventions.

AB BackgroundLeishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease endemic in Bolivia that disproportionately affects people with little social and political capital. Although the treatment is provided free of charge by the Bolivian government, there is an under-utilization of treatments in relation to the estimated affected population. This study explores the experiences of patients with leishmaniasis and the challenges faced when searching for diagnosis and treatment in Bolivia using a human rights approach.MethodsWe conducted open-ended interviews with 14 participants diagnosed with leishmaniasis. The qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis and were interpreted under a human rights approach to health care.ResultsFour themes emerged during data analysis: (1) the decision for seeking a cure takes time; (2) the severity of symptoms and disruption of functioning drives the search for Western medicine; (3) the therapeutic journey between Western and traditional medicine; and (4) accessibility barriers to receive adequate medical treatment. This study showed that access to health care limitations were the most important factors that prevented patients from receiving timely diagnosis and treatment. Cultural factors played a secondary role in their decision to seek medical care.ConclusionsAccessibility barriers resulted in a large pilgrimage between public health care and traditional medicinal treatments for patients with leishmaniasis. This pilgrimage and the related costs are important factors that determine the decision to seek health care. This study contributes to the understanding of the under-utilisation problems of medical services in leishmaniasis and other similar diseases in remote and poor populations.

AB BackgroundHepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the major public health problem worldwide. In clinical practice, serological and molecular assays are the most commonly used diagnostic methods to detect HBV infection in clinical practices.MethodsHere we present a rapid and sensitive recombinase aided amplification assay (RAA) to detect HBV at 39.0 degrees C for 30min without DNA extraction from serum samples. The analytical sensitivity of RAA assay was 100 copies per reaction and showed no cross reaction with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). The universality of RAA assay was validated by testing of 41 archived serum samples with predefined HBV genotypes (B, C and D).ResultsA total of 130 archived suspected HBV infected serum samples were detected by commercial qPCR with DNA extraction and RAA assay without DNA extraction (heat-treatment). Compared with qPCR assay as a reference, the RAA assay obtained 95.7% sensitivity and 100% specificity and a kappa value of 0.818.ConclusionsWe developed a rapid, convenient, highly sensitive and specific method to detect HBV without DNA extraction in clinical samples. This RAA method of HBV detection is very suitable for clinical testing.

ID DISEASE; BURDEN
AB BackgroundIt is estimated that nearly five billion people worldwide do not have access to safe surgery. This access gap disproportionately affects low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). One of the barriers to healthcare in LMICs is access to transport to a healthcare facility. Both availability and affordability of transport can be issues delaying access to health care. This study aimed to describe the main transportation factors affecting access and delay in reaching a facility for health care in Malawi.MethodsThis was a multi-stage, clustered, probability sampling with systematic sampling of households for transportation access to general health and surgical care. Malawi has an estimated population of nearly 18 million people, with a total of 48,233 registered settlements spread over 28 administrative districts. 55 settlements per district were randomly selected for data collection, and 2-4 households were selected, depending on the size. Two persons per household were interviewed.The Surgeons Overseas Assessment of Surgical need (SOSAS) tool was used by trained personnel to collect data during the months of July and August 2016.Analysis of data from 1479 households and 2958 interviewees was by univariate and multivariate methods.ResultsAnalysis showed that 90.1% were rural inhabitants, and 40% were farmers. No formal employment was reported for 24.9% persons. Animal drawn carts prevailed as the most common mode of transport from home to the primary health facility - normally a health centre. Travel to secondary and tertiary level health facilities was mostly by public transport, 31.5 and 43.4% respectively. Median travel time from home to a health centre was 1h, and 2.5h to a central hospital. Thirty nine percent of male and 59% of female head of households reported lack financial resources to go to a hospital.ConclusionIn Malawi, lack of suitable transport, finances and prolonged travel time to a health care centre, all pose barriers to timely access of health care. Improving the availability of transport between rural health centres and district hospitals, and between the district and central hospitals, could help overcome the transportation barriers to health care.

AB BackgroundNo accurate evaluation of smoking and water pollution on bladder cancer has been conducted in the Lebanese population. Our aim is to examine the significance of smoking and one of the main water pollutants Trihalomethanes (THM) on bladder cancer risk.MethodsPopulation Attributable Fraction (PAF) was used to quantify the contribution of the risk factors smoking and THMs on bladder cancer in Lebanon. To calculate PAF for each risk factor, we used the proportion of the population exposed and the relative risk for each risk factor. Relative risks for each risk factor were obtained from published meta-analyses. The population at risk values were obtained from a report on chronic disease risk factor surveillance in Lebanon which was conducted by the World Health Organization between 2008 and 2009 and a national study by Semerjian et al. that conducted a multipathway exposure assessment of selected public drinking waters of Lebanon for the risk factors smoking and THMs, respectively.ResultsBladder cancer cases that were the result of smoking in Lebanon among males and females are 33.4 and 18.6%, respectively. Cases attributed to mid-term exposure to THM contamination of drinking water is estimated at 8.6%.ConclusionThis paper further highlights the negative impact of smoking on bladder cancer risk and adds an overlooked and often underestimated risk that THMs have on this type of cancer. Thus, it is imperative that a national based study which assesses THM exposure by gender and smoking status be implemented to determine the real risk behind this byproduct.

AB Background: Road Traffic Incident (RTI) has been commonly reported as a major public health problem around the world and the incidence is higher in low and middle income countries, such as Ethiopia than high income countries. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and factors associated with RTI among adolescents and children in the hospitals of Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study design was employed among 830 injured children visiting the Emergency Department of four randomly selected hospitals of Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia between February 1 and April 30, 2016. Data were entered into EPI info version 7 and then exported to SPSS version 20, for further analysis. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were fitted. Adjusted odds ratio with its 95% confidence interval was used to determine the statistical significance.
   Results: The overall prevalence of RTI, from all injury cases, was 20%. Socioeconomic status, being wealthy (AOR: 0. 08, 95% CI, 0.01, 0.45) and middle income (AOR: 0.40,95% CI, 0.17, 0.97), parental/guardian education/no education (AOR: 6.91, 95% CI, 2.52, 8.93), mothers marital status/divorced (AOR: 0.01, 95% CI, 0.01, 0.05), and leaving a child with another child for sometime (AOR: 2.56, CI 1.06, 6.20) and most often (AOR: 4.77, CI, 1.15, 9.77) were factors independently associated with RTI.
   Conclusion and recommendation: The prevalence of RTI was found to be high. RTI prevention needs critical consideration and the intervention strategies shall focus on those families who are practicing of leaving a child with another child.

AB BackgroundSelf-protective behaviors of social distancing and vaccination uptake vary by demographics and affect the transmission dynamics of influenza in the United States. By incorporating the socio-behavioral differences in social distancing and vaccination uptake into mathematical models of influenza transmission dynamics, we can improve our estimates of epidemic outcomes. In this study we analyze the impact of demographic disparities in social distancing and vaccination on influenza epidemics in urban and rural regions of the United States.MethodsWe conducted a survey of a nationally representative sample of US adults to collect data on their self-protective behaviors, including social distancing and vaccination to protect themselves from influenza infection. We incorporated this data in an agent-based model to simulate the transmission dynamics of influenza in the urban region of Miami Dade county in Florida and the rural region of Montgomery county in Virginia.ResultsWe compare epidemic scenarios wherein the social distancing and vaccination behaviors are uniform versus non-uniform across different demographic subpopulations. We infer that a uniform compliance of social distancing and vaccination uptake among different demographic subpopulations underestimates the severity of the epidemic in comparison to differentiated compliance among different demographic subpopulations. This result holds for both urban and rural regions.ConclusionsBy taking into account the behavioral differences in social distancing and vaccination uptake among different demographic subpopulations in analysis of influenza epidemics, we provide improved estimates of epidemic outcomes that can assist in improved public health interventions for prevention and control of influenza.

AB BackgroundChlamydia trachomatis infections in women continue to be a major public health concern due to their high prevalence and consequent reproductive morbidities. While antibiotics are usually efficient to clear the Chlamydia, repeat infections are common and may contribute to pathological outcomes. Interferon-gamma (IFN-)-mediated immunity has been suggested to be protective against reinfection, and represent an important anti-chlamydial agent, primarily via the induction of indoleamine-2,3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) enzyme. IDO1 catalyzes the degradation of tryptophan, which can eliminate C. trachomatis infection in vitro. Here, we sought to measure IDO1 expression levels and related immune markers during different C. trachomatis infection statuses (repeated vs single infection vs post antibiotic treatment), in vitro and in vivo.MethodsIn this study, we measured the expression levels of IDO1 and immune regulatory markers, transforming growth factor 1 (TGF-1) and forkhead box P3 (FoxP3), in vaginal swab samples of C. trachomatis-infected women, with either single or repeated infection. In addition, we used an in vitro co-culture model of endometrial carcinoma cell-line and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to measure the same immune markers.ResultsWe found that in women with repeated C. trachomatis infections vaginal IDO1 and TGF-1 expression levels were significantly increased. Whereas, women who cleared their infection post antibiotic treatment, had increased levels of IDO1 and TGF-1, as well as FoxP3. Similarly, using the in vitro model, we found significant upregulation of IDO1 and TGF-1 levels in the co-culture infected with C. trachomatis. Furthermore, we found that in PBMCs infected with C. trachomatis there was a significant upregulation in IDO1 levels, which was independent of IFN-. In fact, C. trachomatis infection in PBMCs failed to induce IFN- levels in comparison to the uninfected culture.ConclusionsOur data provide evidence for a regulatory immune response comprised of IDO1, TGF-1 and FoxP3 in women post antibiotic treatment. In this study, we demonstrated a significant increase in IDO1 expression levels in response to C. trachomatis infection, both in vivo and in vitro, without elevated IFN- levels. This study implicates IDO1 and TGF-1 as part of the immune response to repeated C. trachomatis infections, independently of IFN-.

AB Many interventions that are delivered within public health services have little evidence of effect. Evaluating interventions that are being delivered as a part of usual practice offers opportunities to improve the evidence base of public health. However, such evaluation is challenging and requires the integration of research into system-wide practice. The Born in Bradford's Better Start experimental birth cohort offers an opportunity to efficiently evaluate multiple complex community interventions to improve the health, wellbeing and development of children aged 0-3years. Based on the learning from this programme, this paper offers a pragmatic and practical guide to researchers, public health commissioners and service providers to enable them to integrate research into their everyday practice, thus enabling relevant and robust evaluations within a complex and changing system.Using the principles of co-production the key challenges of integrating research and practice were identified, and appropriate strategies to overcome these, developed across five key stages: 1) Community and stakeholder engagement; 2) Intervention design; 3) Optimising routinely collected data; 4) Monitoring implementation; and 5) Evaluation. As a result of our learning we have developed comprehensive toolkits (https://borninbradford.nhs.uk/what-we-do/pregnancy-early-years/toolkit/) including: an operational guide through the service design process; an implementation and monitoring guide; and an evaluation framework. The evaluation framework incorporates implementation evaluations to enable understanding of intervention performance in practice, and quasi experimental approaches to infer causal effects in a timely manner. We also offer strategies to harness routinely collected data to enhance the efficiency and affordability of evaluations that are directly relevant to policy and practice.These strategies and tools will help researchers, commissioners and service providers to work together to evaluate interventions delivered in real-life settings. More importantly, however, we hope that they will support the development of a connected system that empowers practitioners and commissioners to embed innovation and improvement into their own practice, thus enabling them to learn, evaluate and improve their own services.

AB Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) cause clinical infections in humans. Understanding the evolution and dissemination of ExPEC strains via potential reservoirs is important due to associated morbidity, health care costs and mortality. To further understanding this survey has examined isolates recovered from the faeces of 221 healthy dogs and 427 healthy cats. The distribution of phylogroups varied with host species, and depended on whether the animal was living in a shelter or a home. The human associated STs 69, 73, 95, 131 and 127 were prevalent, with 30.5% of cat isolates and 10.3% of dog isolates representing these ExPEC sequence types. Resistance to the antibiotics ampicillin and tetracycline was common, but resistance to other antimicrobials was negligible.

AB Introduction
   Prescription drug abuse is a major public health problem in rural and suburban areas of the United States, however its emergence in large urban settings with endemic injection drug use remains understudied. We examined temporal trends in injection drug use initiation and mortality among people who inject drugs (PWID) in Baltimore, Maryland.
   Methods
   Data were derived from the baseline assessment of PWID enrolled in a community-based cohort study with longitudinal follow-up for mortality assessment. PWID were recruited from 2005-2008 (N = 1,008) and 2015-2018 (N = 737). We compared characteristics by birth cohort (before/after 1980) and type of drug initiated (prescription opioids, prescription nonopioids, non-injection illicit drugs, or injection drugs). We calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMR) using the US general population as the reference.
   Results
   PWID born after 1980 were more likely to initiate drug use with prescription opioids and nonopioids and had higher levels of polysubstance prior to injection initiation, compared to individuals born before 1980. Overall mortality was high: 2.59 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 2.27-2.95 per 100 person-years). Compared to the US population, the highest SMRs were observed among participants between 40-44 years of age, with especially high mortality among women in this age group (SMR: 29.89, 95% CI: 15.24-44.54).
   Conclusions
   Mirroring national trends, the profile of PWID in Baltimore has changed with increased prescription drug abuse and high levels of polysubstance use among younger PWID. Interventions need to reach those using prescription drugs early after initiation of use in order to reduce transition to injecting. Urgent attention is warranted to address premature mortality, particularly among middle-aged and female PWID.

AB Management of vector population is a commonly used method for mitigating transmission of mosquito-borne infections, but quantitative information on its practical public health impact is scarce. We study the effectiveness of Ultra-Low Volume (ULV) insecticide spraying in public spaces for preventing secondary dengue virus (DENV) cases in Porto Alegre, a non-endemic metropolitan area in Brazil. We developed a stochastic transmission model based on detailed entomological, epidemiological and population data, accounting for the geographical distribution of mosquitoes and humans in the study area and spatial transmission dynamics. The model was calibrated against the distribution of DENV cluster sizes previously estimated from the same geographical setting. We estimated a ULV-induced mortality of 40% for mosquitoes and found that the implemented control protocol avoided about 24% of symptomatic cases occurred in the area throughout the 2015-2016 epidemic season. Increasing the radius of treatment or the mortality of mosquitoes by treating gardens and/or indoor premises would greatly improve the result of control, but trade-offs with respect to increased efforts need to be carefully analyzed. We found a moderate effectiveness for ULV-spraying in public areas, mainly due to the limited ability of this strategy in effectively controlling the vector population. These results can be used to support the design of control strategies in low-incidence, non-endemic settings.
   Author summary Dengue is a mosquito-borne infection that causes millions of symptomatic infections and thousands of deaths per year. This pathogen is expanding its geographic range to areas that were previously free from autochthonous transmission thanks to the intensification of international travels, urbanization and to climatic adaptation of mosquitoes and viruses. Usually interventions against dengue transmission consist in insecticide spraying aimed at killing adult mosquitoes, but the impact of this practice has been rarely evaluated in real-life settings. In this work, we estimate the proportion of dengue cases avoided by Ultra-Low-Volume insecticide spraying in public areas in Porto Alegre (Brazil). This city is characterized by a subtropical climate, negligible pre-existing immunity and low dengue incidence. The low incidence makes this region unsuitable for deployment of the currently licensed vaccine, which is only recommended by the WHO for high-transmission areas. We found that insecticide spraying avoided approximately one fourth of all symptomatic cases. The performance of the intervention was negatively affected by the low treatment-induced mosquito mortality, as we estimated that only 40% of Ae. aegypti are killed by the insecticide. Control outcomes could be improved by increasing the targeted area and including private premises, but trade-offs against increased efforts need to be carefully analyzed.

AB Prophylactic vaccination is a powerful tool for reducing the burden of infectious diseases, due to a combination of direct protection of vaccinees and indirect protection of others via herd immunity. Computational models play an important role in devising strategies for vaccination by making projections of its impacts on public health. Such projections are subject to uncertainty about numerous factors, however. For example, many vaccine efficacy trials focus on measuring protection against disease rather than protection against infection, leaving the extent of breakthrough infections (i.e., disease ameliorated but infection unimpeded) among vaccinees unknown. Our goal in this study was to quantify the extent to which uncertainty about breakthrough infections results in uncertainty about vaccination impact, with a focus on vaccines for dengue. To realistically account for the many forms of heterogeneity in dengue virus (DENV) transmission, which could have implications for the dynamics of indirect protection, we used a stochastic, agent-based model for DENV transmission informed by more than a decade of empirical studies in the city of Iquitos, Peru. Following 20 years of routine vaccination of nine-year-old children at 80% coverage, projections of the proportion of disease episodes averted varied by a factor of 1.76 (95% CI: 1.54-2.06) across the range of uncertainty about breakthrough infections. This was equivalent to the range of vaccination impact projected across a range of uncertainty about vaccine efficacy of 0.268 (95% CI: 0.210-0.329). Until uncertainty about breakthrough infections can be addressed empirically, our results demonstrate the importance of accounting for it in models of vaccination impact.
   Author summary Vaccines are vital tools for safeguarding public health from a variety of infectious disease threats. When decisions are being made about investments in vaccination, computational models provide decision makers with projections of the benefits of vaccination. There are many types of uncertainty that can affect these projections, such as statistical uncertainty about the extent to which vaccination reduces one's risk of experiencing disease. While this type of uncertainty is well accounted for by vaccine trials, a different type of uncertainty often is not: whether the vaccine blocks infection altogether or simply reduces the severity of disease symptoms. In the case of the latter, breakthrough infections occur, meaning that those who are vaccinated are protected but those who are not receive little or no indirect benefit from herd immunity. Focusing on a newly licensed vaccine for dengue, we developed and applied a new simulation model of dengue virus transmission to assess the extent to which uncertainty about breakthrough infections contributes to uncertainty about vaccination impact. We found that a vaccine that prevents breakthrough infections is capable of nearly doubling the impact of vaccination as compared to a vaccine that confers protection solely by reducing the severity of disease symptoms.

TI Socio-epidemiological and land cover risk factors for melioidosis in

SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES

ID COLONY-STIMULATING FACTOR; PSEUDOMALLEI
AB Background Melioidosis, a fatal infectious disease caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, is increasingly diagnosed in tropical regions. However, data on risk factors and the geographic epidemiology of the disease are still limited. Previous studies have also largely been based on the analysis of case series data. Here, we undertook a more definitive hospital-based matched case-control study coupled with spatial analysis to identify demographic, socioeconomic and landscape risk factors for bacteremic melioidosis in the Kedah region of northern Malaysia.
   Methodology/Principal findings We obtained patient demographic and residential information and clinical presentation and medical history data from 254 confirmed melioidosis cases and 384 matched controls attending Hospital Sultanah Bahiyah (HSB), the main tertiary hospital of Alor Setar, the capital city of Kedah, during the period between 2005 and 2011. Crude and adjusted odds ratios employing conditional logistic regression analysis were used to assess if melioidosis in this region is related to risk factors connected with socio-demographics, various behavioural characteristics, and co-occurring diseases. Spatial clusters of cases were determined using a continuous Poisson model as deployed in SaTScan. A land cover map in conjunction with mapped case data was used to determine disease-land type associations using the Fisher's exact test deploying simulated p-values. Crude and adjusted odds ratios indicate that melioidosis in this region is related to gender (males), race, occupation (farming) and co-occurring chronic diseases, particularly diabetes. Spatial analyses of disease incidence, however, showed that disease risk and geographic clustering of cases are related strongly to land cover types, with risk of disease increasing non-linearly with the degree of human modification of the natural ecosystem.
   Conclusions/Significance These findings indicate that melioidosis represents a complex socio-ecological public health problem in Kedah, and that its control requires an understanding and modification of the coupled human and natural variables that govern disease transmission in endemic communities.

TI Development of a SNP barcode to genotype Babesia microti infections
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
AB Babesia microti is tick-borne disease that is an emerging threat to public health due to increasing prevalence and expanding geographic range. Detection and constant surveillance of babesiosis is imperative for predicting pathogen expansion. Leveraging our whole genome sequence (WGS) analyses of B. microti, we developed a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based high resolution melt (HRM) surveillance tool. We developed our HRM assay using available sequence data and identified 775 SNPs. From these candidate SNPs, we developed a 32-SNP barcode that is robust and differentiates geographically distinct populations; it contains SNPs that are putatively neutral, located in nuclear, mitochondrial, and apicoplastal regions. The assays are reproducible and robust, requiring a small quantity of DNA (limit of detection as low as 10 pg.). We analyzed the performance of our HRM assay using 26 B. microti clinical samples used in our WGS study from babesiosis endemic regions in the United States. We identified a minimal barcode consisting of 25 SNPs that differentiate geographically distinct populations across all clinical samples evaluated (average minor allele frequency > 0.22). Supporting our previous WGS findings, our 25-SNP barcode identified distinct barcode signatures that segregate B. microti into two lineages: Northeast and Midwest, with the Northeast having three subpopulations: Connecticut/Rhode Island, Nantucket, and the R1 reference group. Our 25-SNP HRM barcode provides a robust means genetic marker set that will aid in tracking the increasing incidence and expanding geographic range of B. microti infections.

   low infection intensity
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES

AB Background Zoonotic schistosomiasis in Asia, caused by Schistosoma japonicum, remains a major public health concern in China and the Philippines. The developing epidemiological and socio-economic picture of the disease in endemic areas necessitates the development of affordable and highly accurate field diagnostics as an important component in evaluating ongoing integrated control and elimination efforts.
   Methods Three diagnostic methods, namely Kato-Katz (KK) stool microscopy, ELISA and droplet digital (dd) PCR assays, were compared by detecting infection in a total of 412 participants from an area moderately endemic for schistosomiasis in the Philippines.
   Results This comprehensive comparison further defined the diagnostic performance and features for each assay. Compared with the ddPCR assay analysing DNA from faeces (F_ddPCR), which exhibited the highest sensitivity, the SjSAP4 + Sj23-LHD-ELISA had the best accuracy (67.2%) among all five ELISA assays assessed. Schistosomiasis prevalence determined by the SjSAP4 + Sj23-LHD-ELISA and ddPCRs was similar and was at least 2.5 times higher than obtained with the KK method. However, the agreement between these assays was low. In terms of cost and logistical convenience, the SjSAP4 + Sj23-LHD-ELISA represents a cost-effective assay with considerable diagnostic merits. In contrast, although the ddPCR assays exhibited a high level of diagnostic performance, the high cost and the need for specialized equipment presents a major obstacle in their application in screening campaigns.
   Conclusion The SjSAP4 + Sj23-LHD-ELISA represents a cost-effective tool for the diagnosis of schistosomiasis that could prove an important component in the monitoring of integrated control measures as elimination draws closer, whereas the ddPCR assays, in addition to their high sensitivity and specificity, are capable of quantifying infection intensity. However, the high cost of ddPCR hinders its wider application in screening programs, although it could be a valuable reference in the development and improvement of other diagnostic assays.

TI Voltage-gated sodium channel intron polymorphism and four mutations
   comprise six haplotypes in an Aedes aegypti population in Taiwan
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article

AB Background Knockdown resistance (kdr) to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and pyrethroids is known to link amino acid substitutions in the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) in Aedes aegypti. Dengue fever primarily transmitted by Ae. aegypti is an annual public health issue in Taiwan. Accordingly, pyrethroid insecticides have been heavily used for decades to control mosquito populations in the summer and autumn. In Taiwan, an Ae. aegypti population with two VGSC mutations, V1016G and D1763Y, was described previously.
   Methodology/Principal finding Aedes aegypti (G0) were collected in Tainan and Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan. The VGSC gene polymorphisms of the kdr mutations and the intron flanked by exons 20 and 21 were verified. The first generation offspring (G1) were used to measure the resistance level to cypermethrin, a pyrethroid insecticide currently used in Taiwan. In addition to V1016G and D1763Y, we describe two new mutations, S989P and F1534C, which have not been reported in Taiwan. Moreover, we also identify two types (groups A and B) of introns between exons 20 and 21. Intriguingly, the kdr mutations S989P, V1016G and D1763Y are strictly located on the haplotype harboring the group A intron, whereas F1534C links to the group B intron. When those data were taken together, we proposed the following six haplotypes for VGSC genes in Taiwan today: (i)S989-intron A-V1016-F1534-D1763, (ii)S989-intron A-V1016G-F1534-D1763, (iii)S989P-intron A-V1016G-F1534-D1763, (iv)S989-intron A-V1016G-F1534-D1763Y, (v)S989-intron B-V1016-F1534-D1763 and (vi)S989-intron B-V1016-F1534C-D1763. Triple heterozygous mutations of either S989P/V1016G/F1534C or V1016G/F1534C/D1763Y can be found in one single Ae. aegypti mosquito. The proportions of the VGSC mutations were relevant to cypermethrin resistance. Notably, the presence of S989P and V1016G in the population could be a helpful reference to predict the resistance level to cypermethrin. This is the first study to demonstrate the coexistence of four kdr mutations in a population of Ae. aegypti.
   Conclusions/Significance Four kdr mutations (S989P, V1016G, F1534C and D1763Y) and two intron forms (Group A and B) were commonly found in local Ae. aegypti populations in Taiwan.
   Author summary VGSC mutations of Aedes aegypti threaten vector control programs and have been brought to attention in dengue endemic areas. Taiwan has suffered dengue outbreaks, which usually begin from an imported case. Pyrethroid insecticides were used to kill infectious females and adults in the surrounding environment of each suspected case. In Taiwan, V1016G and F1763Y mutations of VGSC have been described previously. Here, we further describe two additional amino acid substitutions (S989P, F1534C) and two forms of the intron between exon 20 and 21. We also propose six haplotypes for VGSC genes in Taiwan today. In conclusion, four kdr mutations (S989P, V1016G, F1534C and D1763Y) and two intron forms (Group A and B) are commonly found in local Ae. aegypti populations in Taiwan.

AB Objective To assess the effectiveness of community-wide deployment of insecticide-impregnated collars for dogs- the reservoir of Leishmania infantum-to reduce infantile clinical visceral leishmaniasis (VL).
   Methods A pair matched-cluster randomised controlled trial involving 40 collared and 40 uncollared control villages (161 [95% C.L.s: 136, 187] children per cluster), was designed to detect a 55% reduction in 48 month confirmed VL case incidence. The intervention study was designed by the authors, but implemented by the Leishmaniasis Control Program in NW Iran, from 2002 to 2006.
   Results The collars provided 50% (95% C.I. 178%-700%) protection against infantile VL incidence (095/1000/yr compared to 175/1000/yr). Reductions in incidence were observed across 76% (22/29) of collared villages compared to pair-matched control villages, with 31 fewer cases by the end of the trial period. In 11 paired villages, no further cases were recorded post-intervention, whereas in 7 collared villages there were 9 new clinical cases relative to controls. Over the trial period, 6,835 collars were fitted at the beginning of the 4 month sand fly season, of which 6.9% (95% C.I. 6.25%, 7.56%) were lost but rapidly replaced. Collar coverage (percent dogs collared) per village varied between 66% and 100%, with a mean annual coverage of 87% (95% C.I. 842, 890%). The variation in post-intervention clinical VL incidence was not associated with collar coverage, dog population size, implementation logistics, dog owner compliance, or other demographic variables tested. Larger reductions and greater persistence in incident case numbers (indicative of transmission) were observed in villages with higher pre-existing VL case incidence.
   Conclusion Community-wide deployment of collars can provide a significant level of protection against infantile clinical VL, achieved in this study by the local VL Control Program, demonstrating attributes desirable of a sustainable public health program. The effectiveness is not dissimilar to the community-level protection provided against human and canine infection with L. infantum.

TI Using intervention mapping to design and implement quality improvement

AB Introduction The Global Strategy to Eliminate Lymphatic Filiariasis (GFELF) through Mass Drug Administration (MDA) has been implemented in Ghana since the year 2000 and transmission has been interrupted in 76 of 98 endemic districts. To improve the MDA in the remaining districts with microfilaria (MF) prevalence above the 1% threshold for the interruption of transmission, there is a need to identify and implement appropriate quality improvement (QI) strategies. This paper describes the use of intervention mapping to select QI strategies to improve an existing evidence-based MDA program in Northern Ghana.
   Methods Due to the complexities associated with implementing evidence-based programs (EBP) such as the lymphatic filariasis MDA and variability in the context, an initial assessment to identify implementation bottlenecks associated with the quality of implementation of lymphatic filariasis MDA in the Bole District of Ghana was conducted using a mixed methods approach. Based on the findings of the initial assessment, a context specific QI strategy was designed and operationalized using intervention mapping strategy in terms of seven domains: actor, the action, action targets, temporality, dose, implementation outcomes addressed, and theoretical justification.
   Results The initial needs assessment shows that the persistent transmission of lymphatic filariasis in the Bole District is characterized by high levels of refusal to ingest the drug, high levels of reported adverse drug reactions, low MDA coverage at community level, poor adherence to the MDA protocol and non-participants' responsiveness.
   Conclusion This study has shown that it is feasible to develop a context specific QI strategy for an existing evidence-based intervention based on an initial needs assessment through stakeholder participation using the IM approach. However, working (towards) QI requires more time than is usually available in public health service. Sufficient theoretical knowledge of implementation research and experience with technical IM experts must be available.

AB Young children are infected by a diverse variety of enteric pathogens in low-income, high-burden countries. Little is known about which conditions pose the greatest risk for enteric pathogen exposure and infection. Young children frequently play in residential public areas around their household, including areas contaminated by human and animal feces, suggesting these exposures are particularly hazardous. The objective of this study was to examine how the dose of six types of common enteric pathogens, and the probability of exposure to one or multiple enteric pathogens for young children playing at public play areas in Kisumu, Kenya is influenced by the type and frequency of child play behaviors that result in ingestion of soil or surface water. Additionally, we examine how pathogen doses and multi-pathogen exposure are modified by spatial variability in the number of public areas children are exposed to in their neighborhood. A Bayesian framework was employed to obtain the posterior distribution of pathogen doses for a certain number of contacts. First, a multivariate mixed effects tobit model was used to obtain the posterior distribution of pathogen concentrations, and their interdependencies, in soil and surface water, based upon empirical data of enteric pathogen contamination in three neighborhoods of Kisumu. Then, exposure doses were estimated using behavioral contact parameters from previous studies and contrasted under different exposure conditions. Pathogen presence and concentration in soil varied widely across local (< 25 meter radius area) and neighborhood-level scales, but pathogens were correlated among distinct surface water samples collected near to each other. Multi-pathogen exposure of children at public play areas was common. Pathogen doses and the probability of multi-pathogen ingestion increased with: higher frequency of environmental contact, especially for surface water; larger volume of soil or water ingested; and with play at multiple sites in the neighborhood versus single site play. Child contact with surface water and soil at public play areas in their neighborhood is an important cause of exposure to enteric pathogens in Kisumu, and behavioral, environmental, and spatial conditions are determinants of exposure.
   Author summary The enteric infections that cause diarrheal disease remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in young children in low-income settings where sanitation infrastructure is limited. The role of different exposure pathways in transmission of enteric pathogens to young children is unknown, but accurate information on relative risks posed by different pathways could improve how well intervention strategies are prioritized. New evidence reveals that young children often play at public areas in their neighborhood, including areas used for human and animal feces disposal, potentially exposing them to heavily contaminated environmental fomites. We describe a novel exposure assessment approach that examines how the dose of six different enteric pathogens, and the probability of exposure to multiple pathogens is influenced by behavioral, environmental, and spatial conditions in public areas of three low-income, urban neighborhoods of Kisumu, Kenya. We found that increased frequency of contact with the environment and volume of material ingested, especially for surface water, and increased contact with different neighborhood locations elevates dose and probability of multiple pathogen exposure. Our study demonstrates that playing in public areas poses a risk to children and provides new insights on how pathogen exposures vary across transmission pathways.

AB Background Since its first detection in the Caribbean in late 2013, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has affected 51 countries in the Americas. The CHIKV epidemic in the Americas was caused by the CHIKV-Asian genotype. In August 2014, local transmission of the CHIKV-Asian genotype was detected in the Brazilian Amazon region. However, a distinct lineage, the CHIKV-East-Central-South-America (ECSA)-genotype, was detected nearly simultaneously in Feira de Santana, Bahia state, northeast Brazil. The genomic diversity and the dynamics of CHIKV in the Brazilian Amazon region remains poorly understood despite its importance to better understand the epidemiological spread and public health impact of CHIKV in the country.
   Methodology/Principal findings We report a large CHIKV outbreak (5,928 notified cases between August 2014 and August 2018) in Boa vista municipality, capital city of Roraima's state, located in the Brazilian Amazon region. We generated 20 novel CHIKV-ECSA genomes from the Brazilian Amazon region using MinION portable genome sequencing. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that despite an early introduction of the Asian genotype in 2015 in Roraima, the large CHIKV outbreak in 2017 in Boa Vista was caused by an ECSA-lineage most likely introduced from northeastern Brazil. Epidemiological analyses suggest a basic reproductive number of R-0 of 1.66, which translates in an estimated 39 (95% CI: 36 to 45) % of Roraima's population infected with CHIKV-ECSA. Finally, we find a strong association between Google search activity and the local laboratory-confirmed CHIKV cases in Roraima.
   Conclusions/Significance This study highlights the potential of combining traditional surveillance with portable genome sequencing technologies and digital epidemiology to inform public health surveillance in the Amazon region. Our data reveal a large CHIKV-ECSA outbreak in Boa Vista, limited potential for future CHIKV outbreaks, and indicate a replacement of the Asian genotype by the ECSA genotype in the Amazon region.

AB Nontyphoidal Salmonella is a major contributor to the global burden of foodborne disease, with invasive infections contributing substantially to illnesses and deaths. We analyzed notifiable disease surveillance data for invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella disease (iNTS) in Queensland, Australia. We used Poisson regression to estimate incidence rate ratios by gender, age group, and geographical area over 2007-2016. There were 995 iNTS cases, with 945 (92%) confirmed by blood culture. Salmonella Virchow accounted for 254 (25%) of 1,001 unique iNTS isolates. Invasive NTS disease notification rates peaked among infants, during the summer months, and in outback Queensland where the notification rate (95% CI) was 17.3 (14.5-20.1) cases per 100,000 population. Overall, there was a 6,5% annual increase (p<0.001) in iNTS disease incidence. In conclusion, high iNTS rates among males, infants, and the elderly require investigation of household level risk factors for NTS infection. Controlling Salmonella Virchow infections is a public health priority.

AB Forecasting the impacts of climate change on Aedes-borne virusesespecially dengue, chikungunya, and Zikais a key component of public health preparedness. We apply an empirically parameterized model of viral transmission by the vectors Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus, as a function of temperature, to predict cumulative monthly global transmission risk in current climates, and compare them with projected risk in 2050 and 2080 based on general circulation models (GCMs). Our results show that if mosquito range shifts track optimal temperature ranges for transmission (21.3-34.0 degrees C for Ae. aegypti; 19.9-29.4 degrees C for Ae. albopictus), we can expect poleward shifts in Aedes-borne virus distributions. However, the differing thermal niches of the two vectors produce different patterns of shifts under climate change. More severe climate change scenarios produce larger population exposures to transmission by Ae. aegypti, but not by Ae. albopictus in the most extreme cases. Climate-driven risk of transmission from both mosquitoes will increase substantially, even in the short term, for most of Europe. In contrast, significant reductions in climate suitability are expected for Ae. albopictus, most noticeably in southeast Asia and west Africa. Within the next century, nearly a billion people are threatened with new exposure to virus transmission by both Aedes spp. in the worst-case scenario. As major net losses in year-round transmission risk are predicted for Ae. albopictus, we project a global shift towards more seasonal risk across regions. Many other complicating factors (like mosquito range limits and viral evolution) exist, but overall our results indicate that while climate change will lead to increased net and new exposures to Aedes-borne viruses, the most extreme increases in Ae. albopictus transmission are predicted to occur at intermediate climate change scenarios.

AB Background In the wake of the West African Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak of 2014-2016, thousands of EVD survivors began to manifest a constellation of systemic and ophthalmic sequelae. Besides systemic arthralgias, myalgias, and abdominal pain, patients were developing uveitis, a spectrum of inflammatory eye disease leading to eye pain, redness, and vision loss. To investigate this emerging eye disease, resources and equipment were needed to promptly evaluate this sight-threatening condition, particularly given our identification of Ebola virus in the ocular fluid of an EVD survivor during disease convalescence.
   Methodology/Principal findings A collaborative effort involving ophthalmologists, infectious disease specialists, eye care nurses, and physician leadership at Eternal Love Winning Africa (ELWA) Hospital in Liberia led to the development of a unique screening eye clinic for EVD survivors to screen, treat, and refer patients for more definitive care. Medications, resources, and equipment were procured from a variety of sources including discount websites, donations, purchasing with humanitarian discounts, and limited retail to develop a screening eye clinic and rapidly perform detailed ophthalmologic exams. Findings were documented in 96 EVD survivors to inform public health officials and eye care providers of the emerging disease process. Personal protective equipment was tailored to the environment and implications of EBOV persistence within intraocular fluid.
   Conclusions/Significance A screening eye clinic was feasible and effective for the rapid screening, care, and referral of EVD survivors with uveitis and retinal disease. Patients were screened promptly for an initial assessment of the disease process, which has informed other efforts within West Africa related to immediate patient care needs and our collective understanding of EVD sequelae. Further attention is needed to understand the pathogensis and treatment of ophthalmic sequelae given recent EVD outbreaks in West Africa and ongoing outbreak within Democratic Republic of Congo.

AB Background Despite decades of use of control programs, schistosomiasis remains a global public health problem. To further reduce prevalence and intensity of infection, or to achieve the goal of elimination in low-endemic areas, there needs to be better diagnostic tools to detect low-intensity infections in low-endemic areas in Brazil. The rationale for development of new diagnostic tools is that the current standard test Kato-Katz (KK) is not sensitive enough to detect low-intensity infections in low-endemic areas. In order to develop new diagnostic tools, we employed a proteomics approach to identify biomarkers associated with schistosome-specific immune responses in hopes of developing sensitive and specific new methods for immunodiagnosis.
   Methods and findings Immunoproteomic analyses were performed on egg extracts of Schistosoma mansoni using pooled sera from infected or non-infected individuals from a low-endemic area of Brazil. Cross reactivity with other soil-transmitted helminths (STH) was determined using pooled sera from individuals uniquely infected with different helminths. Using this approach, we identified 23 targets recognized by schistosome acute and chronic sera samples. To identify immunoreactive targets that were likely glycan epitopes, we compared these targets to the immunoreactivity of spots treated with sodium metaperiodate oxidation of egg extract. This treatment yielded 12/23 spots maintaining immunoreactivity, suggesting that they were protein epitopes. From these 12 spots, 11 spots cross-reacted with sera from individuals infected with other STH and 10 spots cross-reacted with the negative control group. Spot number 5 was exclusively immunoreactive with sera from S. mansoni-infected groups in native and deglycosylated conditions and corresponds to Major Egg Antigen (MEA). We expressed MEA as a recombinant protein and showed a similar recognition pattern to that of the native protein via western blot. IgG-ELISA gave a sensitivity of 87.10% and specificity of 89.09% represented by area under the ROC curve of 0.95. IgG-ELISA performed better than the conventional KK (2 slides), identifying 56/64 cases harboring 1-10 eggs per gram of feces that were undiagnosed by KK parasitological technique.
   Conclusions The serological proteome approach was able to identify a new diagnostic candidate. The recombinant egg antigen provided good performance in IgG-ELISA to detect individuals with extreme low-intensity infections (1 egg per gram of feces). Therefore, the IgG-ELISA using this newly identified recombinant MEA can be a useful tool combined with other techniques in low-endemic areas to determine the true prevalence of schistosome infection that is underestimated by the KK method. Further, to overcome the complexity of ELISA in the field, a second generation of antibody-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) can be developed.

TI Calculating the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth infection
   through pooling of stool samples: Choosing and optimizing the pooling

ID EGG COUNTS; SCHISTOSOMA-MANSONI; SENSITIVITY; DIAGNOSIS; INTENSITY
AB Prevalence is a common epidemiological measure for assessing soil-transmitted helminth burden and forms the basis for much public-health decision-making. Standard diagnostic techniques are based on egg detection in stool samples through microscopy and these techniques are known to have poor sensitivity for individuals with low infection intensity, leading to poor sensitivity in low prevalence populations. PCR diagnostic techniques offer very high sensitivities even at low prevalence, but at a greater cost for each diagnostic test in terms of equipment needed and technician time and training. Pooling of samples can allow prevalence to be estimated while minimizing the number of tests performed. We develop a model of the relative cost of pooling to estimate prevalence, compared to the direct approach of testing all samples individually. Analysis shows how expected relative cost depends on both the underlying prevalence in the population and the size of the pools constructed. A critical prevalence level (approx. 31%) above which pooling is never cost effective, independent of pool size. When no prevalence information is available, there is no basis on which to choose between pooling and testing all samples individually. We recast our model of relative cost in a Bayesian framework in order to investigate how prior information about prevalence in a given population can be used to inform the decision to choose either pooling or full testing. Results suggest that if prevalence is below 10%, a relatively small exploratory prevalence survey (10-15 samples) can be sufficient to give a high degree of certainty that pooling may be relatively cost effective.

ID RISK-FACTORS; BOVINE BRUCELLOSIS; EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Background Brucellosis is one of the most common zoonoses worldwide, causing direct losses to the livestock industry and threatening human health. Little is known about the status and factors affecting farmers' private investment in the prevention and control of sheep brucellosis in China.
   Methodology/Principal findings From April to October 2017, a cross-sectional, house-based study was conducted in 7 Chinese provinces. A total of 1037 households included in the study were analyzed. The average amount of private investment in the prevention and control of brucellosis was $0.730.54 per sheep. Multivariable analysis showed that factors facilitating private investment included older age of householder (OR = 1.07, 95%CI: 1.03-1.11), herd size >100 (OR = 2.49, 95%CI: 1.38-4.51), a higher percentage of income from sheep farming comparing to the total household income (OR = 1.14, 95%CI: 1.11-1.16), higher score of brucellosis knowledge (OR = 3.85, 95%CI: 1.40-10.51), actively learning related knowledge (OR = 2.98, 95%CI: 1.55-5.74), actively participating in related training courses (OR = 3.07, 95%CI: 1.52-6.18), care about other people's attitudes (OR = 1.75, 95%CI: 1.35-2.28), concern about the health of neighbors' livestock (OR = 1.75, 95%CI: 1.23-2.51). The analysis found a discouraging factor for private investment, supporting culling policy (OR = 0.67, 95%CI: 0.49-0.91).
   Conclusions/Significance In addition to providing interventions related to farmers' knowledge, attitudes and practices, guidance must be offered to help farmers understanding the importance of private investment in the prevention and control of brucellosis.
   Author summary Brucellosis is one of the most common zoonoses worldwide. The disease is endemic in China and the prevention and control of brucellosis mainly depends on government investment. From the perspective of economic theory, private investment can help supplement public investment. Thus, it is important to describe the status of farmers' private investment in brucellosis prevention and control in epidemic areas and to explore the factors influencing this investment.

AB Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is a carcinogen, and exposure to iAs via food and water is a global public health problem. iAs-contaminated drinking water alone affects >100 million people worldwide, including 50 million in Bangladesh. Once absorbed into the blood stream, most iAs is converted to mono-methylated (MMA) and then di-methylated (DMA) forms, facilitating excretion in urine. Arsenic metabolism efficiency varies among individuals, in part due to genetic variation near AS3MT (arsenite methyltransferase; 10q24.32). To identify additional arsenic metabolism loci, we measured protein-coding variants across the human exome for 1,660 Bangladeshi individuals participating in the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS). Among the 19,992 coding variants analyzed exome-wide, the minor allele (A) of rs61735836 (p.Val101Met) in exon 3 of FTCD (formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase) was associated with increased urinary iAs% (P = 8x10(-13)), increased MMA% (P = 2x10(-16)) and decreased DMA% (P = 6x10(-23)). Among 2,401 individuals with arsenic-induced skin lesions (an indicator of arsenic toxicity and cancer risk) and 2,472 controls, carrying the low-efficiency A allele (frequency = 7%) was associated with increased skin lesion risk (odds ratio = 1.35; P = 1x10(-5)). rs61735836 is in weak linkage disequilibrium with all nearby variants. The high-efficiency/major allele (G/Valine) is human-specific and eliminates a start codon at the first 5-proximal Kozak sequence in FTCD, suggesting selection against an alternative translation start site. FTCD is critical for catabolism of histidine, a process that generates one-carbon units that can enter the one-carbon/folate cycle, which provides methyl groups for arsenic metabolism. In our study population, FTCD and AS3MT SNPs together explain 10% of the variation in DMA% and support a causal effect of arsenic metabolism efficiency on arsenic toxicity (i.e., skin lesions). In summary, this work identifies a coding variant in FTCD associated with arsenic metabolism efficiency, providing new evidence supporting the established link between one-carbon/folate metabolism and arsenic toxicity.
   Author summary Chronic exposure to arsenic through food and drinking water is a serious global health issue, as arsenic can increase risk for cancer, cardiorespiratory diseases, and other chronic conditions. Ingested arsenic absorbed into the blood stream is metabolized (through reduction and methylation reactions) in order to facilitate excretion in urine and removal from the body. Individuals differ with respect to the efficiency of this metabolism, in part due to inherited genetic variation. The only region of the genome known to contain variation that impacts arsenic metabolism efficiency is 10q24.32, and these variants likely alter the function of the nearby gene AS3MT (arsenite methyltransferase). In order to identify new genetic variants that affect arsenic metabolism, we measured variation in protein-coding regions across the entire genome for >4,800 individuals with varying levels of exposure to arsenic through naturally-contaminated drinking water in Bangladesh. Using this data, we identified a variant in the FTCD gene (formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase) that is associated with arsenic metabolism efficiency and risk for arsenic-induced skin lesions. This genetic variant alters the FTCD amino acid sequence, potentially disrupting a cryptic protein translation start site in exon 3. FTCD codes for an enzyme involved in histidine catabolism and one-carbon/folate metabolism; thus, our result provides new evidence supporting the well-established hypothesis that the folate/one-carbon cycle plays an important role in arsenic-related disease.

TI Sympatric versus allopatric evolutionary contexts shape differential
   immune response in Biomphalaria/Schistosoma interaction

AB Selective pressures between hosts and their parasites can result in reciprocal evolution or adaptation of specific life history traits. Local adaptation of resident hosts and parasites should lead to increase parasite infectivity/virulence (higher compatibility) when infecting hosts from the same location (in sympatry) than from a foreign location (in allopatry). Analysis of geographic variations in compatibility phenotypes is the most common proxy used to infer local adaptation. However, in some cases, allopatric host-parasite systems demonstrate similar or greater compatibility than in sympatry. In such cases, the potential for local adaptation remains unclear. Here, we study the interaction between Schistosoma and its vector snail Biomphalaria in which such discrepancy in local versus foreign compatibility phenotype has been reported. Herein, we aim at bridging this gap of knowledge by comparing life history traits (immune cellular response, host mortality, and parasite growth) and molecular responses in highly compatible sympatric and allopatric Schistosoma/Biomphalaria interactions originating from different geographic localities (Brazil, Venezuela and Burundi). We found that despite displaying similar prevalence phenotypes, sympatric schistosomes triggered a rapid immune suppression (dual-RNAseq analyses) in the snails within 24h post infection, whereas infection by allopatric schistosomes (regardless of the species) was associated with immune cell proliferation and triggered a non-specific generalized immune response after 96h. We observed that, sympatric schistosomes grow more rapidly. Finally, we identify miRNAs differentially expressed by Schistosoma mansoni that target host immune genes and could be responsible for hijacking the host immune response during the sympatric interaction. We show that despite having similar prevalence phenotypes, sympatric and allopatric snail-Schistosoma interactions displayed strong differences in their immunobiological molecular dialogue. Understanding the mechanisms allowing parasites to adapt rapidly and efficiently to new hosts is critical to control disease emergence and risks of Schistosomiasis outbreaks.
   Author summary Schistosomiasis, the second most widespread human parasitic disease after malaria, is caused by helminth parasites of the genus Schistosoma. More than 200 million people in 74 countries suffer from the pathological, and societal consequences of this disease. To complete its life cycle, the parasite requires an intermediate host, a freshwater snail of the genus Biomphalaria for its transmission. Given the limited options for treating Schistosoma mansoni infections in humans, much research has focused on developing methods to control transmission by its intermediate snail host. Biomphalaria glabrata. Comparative studies have shown that infection of the snail triggers complex cellular and humoral immune responses resulting in significant variations in parasite infectivity and snail susceptibility, known as the so-called polymorphism of compatibility. However, studies have mostly focused on characterizing the immunobiological mechanisms in sympatric interactions. Herein we used a combination of molecular and phenotypic approaches to compare the effect of infection in various sympatric and allopatric evolutionary contexts, allowing us to better understand the mechanisms of host-parasite local adaptation. Learning more about the immunobiological interactions between B. glabrata and S. mansoni could have important socioeconomic and public health impacts by changing the way we attempt to eradicate parasitic diseases and prevent or control schistosomiasis in the field.

AB BackgroundAdverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) are of great public health concern. FDA-approved drug labeling summarizes ADRs of a drug product mainly in three sections, i.e., Boxed Warning (BW), Warnings and Precautions (WP), and Adverse Reactions (AR), where the severity of ADRs are intended to decrease in the order of BW>WP>AR. Several reported studies have extracted ADRs from labeling documents, but most, if not all, did not discriminate the severity of the ADRs by the different labeling sections. Such a practice could overstate or underestimate the impact of certain ADRs to the public health. In this study, we applied the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) to drug labeling and systematically analyzed and compared the ADRs from the three labeling sections with a specific emphasis on analyzing serious ADRs presented in BW, which is of most drug safety concern.ResultsThis study investigated New Drug Application (NDA) labeling documents for 1164 single-ingredient drugs using Oracle Text search to extract MedDRA terms. We found that only a small portion of MedDRA Preferred Terms (PTs), 3819 out of 21,920 or 17.42%, were observed in a whole set of documents. In detail, 466/3819 (12.0%) PTs were in BW, 2023/3819 (53.0%) were in WP, and 2961/3819 (77.5%) were in AR sections. We also found a higher overlap of top 20 occurring BW PTs with WP sections compared to AR sections. Within the MedDRA System Organ Class levels, serious ADRs (sADRs) from BW were prevalent in Nervous System disorders and Vascular disorders. A Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) revealed that drugs within the same therapeutic category shared the same ADR patterns in BW (e.g., nervous system drug class is highly associated with drug abuse terms such as dependence, substance abuse, and respiratory depression).ConclusionsThis study demonstrated that combining MedDRA standard terminologies with data mining techniques facilitated computer-aided ADR analysis of drug labeling. We also highlighted the importance of labeling sections that differ in seriousness and application in drug safety. Using sADRs primarily related to BW sections, we illustrated a prototype approach for computer-aided ADR monitoring and studies which can be applied to other public health documents.

TI Causes of synthetic disease-modifying drug discontinuation in rheumatoid
   arthritis: Data from a large real-life cohort
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID METHOTREXATE; COMBINATION; THERAPY
AB The treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has evolved rapidly in recent years. Nonetheless, conventional synthetic disease-modifying drugs (csDMARDs) remain the gold standard for RA treatment.
   The treatment for RA is expensive and this has a negative impact on public health. Given the low cost of csDMARDs compared to those of other treatment strategies, it is important to manage this type of treatment properly. Information on the duration of use of each drug and the reasons for their discontinuation is relevant to medical practitioners as it could improve the information available regarding side effects and their proper management. Moreover, data from clinical practice in the population can provide health care managers with information for resource allocation and optimization of csDMARD use with a consequent cost reduction in the treatment of RA.
   In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to describe the use of csDMARDs in public health services in Brazil, emphasizing on the duration of use and reasons for discontinuation of each drug. This study is a part of the REAL, a multicenter project that evaluated Brazilian patients with RA from eleven rheumatology services from August to October 2015. Patients were examined clinically, and an analysis of complementary exams and medical records was performed.
   A total of 1125 patients were included. 98.5% were women with a median age of 55.6 years. 36% and 90.84% patients were using biological disease-modifying drugs (bDMARDs) and csDMARDs, respectively. The duration of use and doses of each medication and the causes of suspension were analyzed.
   Most of the patients analyzed in this study were using csDMARDs for prolonged periods and methotrexate showed the longest duration of use. Interruption indexes due to ineffectiveness and side effects were analyzed. The knowledge of common adverse effects may alert attending physicians to the proper management of effective and low-cost therapeutic groups.

TI Finding the optimal mix of smoking initiation and cessation
   interventions to reduce smoking prevalence
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID COST-EFFECTIVENESS; UNITED-STATES; ADOLESCENTS
AB There are more than one billion smokers globally according to the World Health Organization (WHO) report in 2017. Every year tobacco use causes nearly 6 million deaths worldwide. To deal with the smoking epidemic, society needs to invest resources efficiently. In this paper we introduce an optimal control model to determine the optimal mix of smoking initiation and cessation interventions to reduce smoking. We construct the model to reach a smoking prevalence target within a specific time horizon while minimizing cost. Our performance measure captures the cost of policy implementation over time, adjusting for inflation and social discounting. The analytical solutions to the model are presented in forms of ordinary differential equations (ODE). We then conduct several numerical simulations using data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and empirical studies. We first present analytical solutions for our model to solve for the optimal mix of smoking interventions. Then we simulate a public health policy to achieve 5% smoking prevalence in the US by 2030 using different combinations of real-life interventions. We examine the optimal trajectories, allocative efficiency and annual total cost of smoking cessation and initiation interventions. We find consistent results across all simulations. Our specific example reveals that the most efficient way to reach stated goal is by targeting cessation interventions first, and then gradually shifting resources to initiation interventions over time. While our numerical results are specific to the intervention we selected, our framework can be easily expanded to consider other potential interventions. We discuss the implications of our approach for the formulation of dynamic public health policies.

   We conducted a case control study of 1073 randomly selected mothers who delivered babies in four hospitals in the district. We reviewed antenatal and maternity registers to obtain information about the mothers and their offspring. We fitted a multiple logistic regression to examine relationships between possible factors associated with LBW.
   Results
   From the total sample of mothers (n = 1073), 77% (n = 824) were adult women, aged 20 to 35 years. Of the adult mothers, 38.54% (n = 412) delivered low birth weight (LBW) infants. The mean gestational age and weight of all infants at birth was 37.16 weeks (SD 2.92) and 2675.48 grams (SD 616.16) respectively. LBW was associated with prematurity, odds ratio (OR) 7.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.18 to 9.89; premature rupture of membranes OR 7.33, 95% CI 2.43 to 22.12 and attending fewer than five antenatal care (ANC) visits OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.61. Male infants were less likely to be LBW, in this population.
   Conclusion
   Women who attended fewer than five ANC visits were predisposed to give birth to low birth weight babies. Mothers should be encouraged to attend ANC visits to detect adverse events like premature rupture of membranes and premature labour timeously.

AB BackgroundLimited evidence exists for intergenerational interventions to promote health and well-being in older adults and preschool children. We therefore aimed to evaluate the implementation, feasibility and outcome of an intergenerational health promotion program based on psycho-motor activity.MethodsA multicenter mixed-methods study with preschool children and older adults as equivalent target-groups, and professionals and parents as additional informants was conducted in Austria. The study included a needs assessment, a pilot phase with a formative process evaluation and a subsequent rollout phase to evaluate the outcome and the adapted processes of the intervention program. To analyze the qualitative data, a modified form of the framework method was applied. Quantitative data were collected with a time-sampling method and were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical procedures.ResultsOne hundred ninety-six participants (93 older adults [54 to 96years old, 83% female], 78 children [2 to 7years old, 58% female], 13 professionals and 12 parents) from 16 institutions (eight kindergartens and eight geriatric facilities) were included in the study. The qualitative process evaluation revealed several aspects for improvement of the intervention program. Well-being as measured by observing spontaneous intergenerational contacts (p<0.001) and facial expressions (effect size r=0.34; p<0.001) showed a significant increase between the rollout baseline and follow-up assessments.ConclusionsProfessionals in geriatric institutions and kindergartens could facilitate interactions between members of the different generations by offering an intergenerational intervention program based on psycho-motor activities in the future.

AB BackgroundWhile promoting active commuting to school can positively affect children's daily physical activity levels, effectively engaging community members to maximize program impact remains challenging. We evaluated the initial utility of adding a technology-enabled citizen science engagement model, called Our Voice, to a standard Safe Routes to School (SRTS) program to enhance program engagement activities and student travel mode behavior.MethodsIn Investigation 1, a prospective controlled comparison design was used to compare the initial year of the Santa Clara County Public Health Department's SRTS program, with and without the Our Voice engagement model added, in two elementary schools in Gilroy, California, USA. School parents served as Our Voice citizen scientists in the SRTS + Our Voice school. In Investigation 2, the feasibility of the combined SRTS + Our Voice methods was evaluated in a middle school in the same district using students, rather than adults, as citizen scientists. Standard SRTS program engagement measures and student travel mode tallies were collected at the beginning and end of the school year for each school.ResultsIn the elementary school investigation (Investigation 1), the SRTS + Our Voice elementary school held twice as many first-year SRTS planning/encouragement events compared to the SRTS-Alone elementary school, and between-school changes in walking/biking to school rates favored the SRTS + Our Voice school (increases of 24.5% vs. 2.6%, P<.001). The Investigation 2 results supported the feasibility of using students to conduct SRTS + Our Voice in a middle school-age population.ConclusionsThe findings from this first-generation study indicated that adding a technology-enabled citizen science process to a standard elementary school SRTS program was associated with higher levels of community engagement and walking/biking to school compared to SRTS alone. The approach was also found to be acceptable and feasible in a middle school setting.

DT Article
DE Initial stabilization; Trauma patients; Pre-referral; Emergency care
ID DEATH; EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Background: The outcomes of trauma are considered to be time dependent. Efficient and timely pre-referral stabilization of trauma patients has been shown to impact survival. Tanzania has no formal pre-hospital or trauma system. World Health Organisation has provided a set of standards for initial stabilization of trauma patients according to the level of the hospitals. We aimed to describe pre-referral stabilization provided to adult trauma patient referred to the national referral hospital and compliance with World Health Organisation guidelines.
   Methods: This prospective observational cross-sectional study was conducted at the Emergency Medicine Department of Muhimbili National Hospital (EMD-MNH), between July 2017 and December 2017. Eligible patients were adults with head injury and extremity injury >= 18 years who were referred from a peripheral hospital and had a referral note. Research assistant enrolled patients using structured case report form clinical information, and initial stabilization received at the referring hospital. Primary outcome was the proportion of patients who had initial stabilization performed according to World Health Organisation recommendation.
   Results: We enrolled 368 (29% of eligible patients), the median age was 34 years (Interquartile range 26-44 years), and 281 (76%) were male. Overall 69% of referred patients arrived at the EMD more than 24 h after injury. Of those enrolled, 50 (13.6%) patients had received at least one stabilization intervention prior to transfer to MNH. Among 206 patients with extremity injuries, splinting was inadequate or missing in all cases; No patients with head injury received cervical spine protection. Among patients referred from a health center, 26.9% received an initial stabilization, while stabilization procedures were administered to 13.2% of those from district hospitals, and 10% of those from regional hospitals.
   Conclusions: In this urban public emergency department in Tanzania, majority of trauma patients were referred from lower health facilities after 24-h of injury. Most did not receive initial trauma stabilization as recommended by the World Health Organisation guidelines. Future studies should identify barriers to pre-referral stabilization of adult trauma patients.

TI Emergence of antibiotic resistance in immunocompromised host
   populations: A case study of emerging antibiotic resistant tuberculosis
   in AIDS patients
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID INFECTION; EVOLUTION; WORLDWIDE; DYNAMICS
AB Objective
   The evolution of antibiotic resistance is far outpacing the development of new antibiotics, causing global public health concern about infections that will increasingly be unresponsive to antimicrobials. This risk of emerging antibiotic resistance may be meaningfully altered in highly AIDS-immunocompromised populations. Such populations fundamentally alter the bacterial evolutionary landscape in two ways, which we seek to model and analyze. First, widespread, population-level immunoincompetence creates a novel host environment with disrupted selective pressures. Second, within AIDS-prevalent populations, the recommendation that antibiotics be taken to treat and prevent opportunistic infection raises the risk of selection for drug-resistant pathogens.
   Design
   To determine the impact of HIV/AIDS on the emergence of antibiotic resistance-specifically in the developing world where high prevalence and economic challenges complicate disease management.
   Methods
   We present an SEIR epidemiological model of bacterial infection, and parametrize it to capture HIV/AIDS-attributable emergence of resistance under conditions of both high and low HIV/AIDS prevalence.
   Results
   We demonstrate that HIV/AIDS-immunocompromised hosts can be responsible for a disproportionately greater contribution to emergence of resistance than would be expected based on population-wide HIV/AIDS prevalence alone.
   Conclusions
   As such, the AIDS-immunocompromised have the potential become wellsprings of novel, resistant, opportunistic pathogen strains that can propagate into the broader global community. We discuss how public health policies for HIV/AIDS management can shape the evolutionary environment for opportunistic bacterial infections.

AB Benefits of antibiotics are threatened by the self-medication, people's lack of knowledge and inappropriate use of antibiotics, especially in developing countries. This study was designed to determine knowledge; attitudes and practices toward antibiotics use in an urban community, and evaluate the factors that are associated with antibiotic use. Between January and March 2015, a cross sectional and prospective study was conducted in all pharmacies within the Douala IV health district, Cameroon. Anonymous interviews including both open and closed ended questions were conducted in participants selected by convenience sampling Descriptive and logistic regression analysis were performed using StataSE11 software (version 11 SE) and R software (version 3.1.1) in data analysis. Overall 402 (33.7%) of 1,192 customers purchased antibiotics and of these, 47% bought antibiotics without a prescription. 60.7% of purchased antibiotics was for adult 'patients and around 60% of parents carried out self-medication on their children. The vast majority reported that all microbes can be treated with antibiotics (88.3%). The belief that antibiotics are appropriate for bacterial infections was more common among those with a higher level education (OR = 4.03, 95% CI: 1.89-8.57, p<0.0001) and among public/private servants (OR = 2.47, 95% CI: 1.21-5.08, p = 0.013). Physicians provide less explanations about antibiotics are and their potential side effects than the pharmacy auxiliaries (OR = 0.205, 95% CI = 0.09-0.46, p<0.0001), but more than pharmacists (OR = 3.692, 95% CI: 1.44-9.25, p = 0.005). Indications on antibiotics use were 7 times more given to customers with a prescription compared to those without a prescription (OR = 7.37, 95% CI = 2.13-25.43, p = 0.002). Adult male (OR = 2.32, 95% CI: 1.24-4.34, p = 0.009) and higher education (OR = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.08-3.89, p = 0.027) were significantly associated with self-medication. Misuse, little "practical knowledge" and high self-medication confirm the unsatisfactory prescription and dispensing practices of the antibiotics in our country. These results highlight the important of the development and implementation appropriate guidelines for the responsible use of antibiotics for health care providers and health education targeting community members themselves.

AB This study examined factors related to the quality of life (QOL) of gay and bisexual men during emerging adulthood in Taiwan. The factors included traditional harassment (e.g., verbal ridicule, relational exclusion, physical aggression, and theft of belongings), cyber harassment, sex-and gender-related factors (e.g., sexual orientation, age at initial identification of sexual orientation, self-reported level of gender nonconformity, and perceived social acceptance toward homosexuality and bisexuality), and demographic characteristics. In total, 305 Taiwanese gay and bisexual men, aged 20-25 years, were recruited. Their QOL, traditional harassment, and cyber harassment data were collected using the World Health Organization Questionnaire on Quality of Life: Short Form, School Bullying Experience Questionnaire, and Cyberbullying Experiences Questionnaire, respectively. In total, 60.3%, 34.4%, 28.2%, and 29.5% of the participants reported experiencing traditional harassment, cyber harassment, traditional harassment across multiple contexts, and harassment in multiple forms, respectively. Both traditional and cyber harassment were significantly associated with lower QOL. Individuals who experienced traditional harassment across multiple contexts and harassment in multiple forms had lower QOL in nearly all domains than did individuals who had experienced traditional harassment in a single context and harassment of a single form. However, the QOL did not significantly differ between individuals who had experienced traditional harassment in a single context and nonvictims nor between individuals who had experienced harassment of a single form and nonvictims. Lower education level, older age at initial identification of sexual orientation, higher perception of gender nonconformity, and lower perceived social acceptance toward homosexuality and bisexuality were significantly associated with lower QOL. Clinical and public health professionals should consider these factors when developing programs to enhance the QOL of gay and bisexual men.

TI Factors associated with public knowledge of and attitudes to dementia: A
   cross-sectional study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID NORTHERN-IRELAND; NATIONAL-SURVEY; STIGMA; DISEASE; PEOPLE
AB Introduction
   Dementia is a major public health concern but one that continues to be stigmatised. We examine lay knowledge of dementia and attitudes to people with dementia as potential precursors of public anxiety, focusing on the social characteristics associated with (a) the formation of these attitudes, and (b) the perception of the need for restriction and control for people with dementia.
   Methods
   Analysis of the 2014 Northern Ireland Life and Times survey, which included questions on knowledge of, attitudes to and personal experience with dementia. We used (a) latent class analysis and (b) logistic regression to examine factors associated with respondent attitudes towards dementia.
   Results
   Respondents (n = 1211) had relatively good general knowledge of dementia, but limited knowledge of specific risk factors. Negative perceptions of dementia were mitigated somewhat by personal contact. A high proportion of respondents felt that high levels of control were appropriate for people diagnosed with dementia, even at early stages of the disease.
   Conclusion
   Personal antipathy to dementia was highly prevalent despite ongoing public campaigns to increase public awareness of developments in its prevention, treatment and consequent care pathways and hampering efforts to widen social inclusion. Fresh thinking and more resources may be needed to challenge persisting common misapprehension of the condition and the formation of entrenched stigma.

DE Perspective; Health policy; Reform; Survey
ID POLICY
AB BackgroundTo understand the attitudes and opinions of directors of large public hospitals in China on reform policies of public hospital.MethodA cross-sectional survey utilizing questionnaires of the Survey of Attitudes to Public Hospital Reform by Directors was conducted in 2014. The respondents were randomly selected in 100 tertiary public hospitals in 62 cities of 31 provinces in China by stratified multistage random cluster sampling method. 178 directors and associate directors working in tertiary public hospitals were involved. Standard descriptive statistics were used to describe and summarize the data.ResultsThe measure of increasing government subsidies ranked first in the list of concerns expressed by responders (N=149, 83.7%); while implementing clinical pathways ranked lowest in the list of concerns (N=34, 19.7%). More associate directors (N=64, 70.3%) were concerned over the measures of removing drug mark-ups than directors (N=45, 51.7%) ((2)=6.49, p=0.01). In addition, 75.8% of responders were concerned over the policy of salary system reform, while only 14.5% of them were satisfied with their current income level. What's more, more than half responders were concerned over the policy of adjusting pricing policies (N=127, 71.4%) and removing drug markups (N=109, 61.2%).ConclusionIn healthcare reform, the financial security for the hospitals should be considered as a priority by the policy-makers, without the reform goals cannot be achieved. Thus, an incentive mechanism needs to be established in China to guide the director to focus on the medical quality.

AB BackgroundAdherence to Option B plus Antiretroviral Therapy plays a vital role in preventing mother to child transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus and development of drug resistance. This study was aimed to assess adherence to option B plus ART and associated factors among HIV positive pregnant women at public Hospitals in Southern Ethiopia.MethodsFacility based cross sectional study was conducted on HIV positive pregnant mothers attending public health facilities' antenatal care unit. Systematic random sampling technique was employed to select 290 HIV positive pregnant women enrolled in the Option B plus program. Data were collected by using structured questionnaire. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis were used to identify factors associated with option B plus ART adherence. P-value less than 0.05 was considered as cut of point to declare statistical significance.ResultsThe overall adherence to option B plus ART among HIV positive pregnant women was 236 (81.4%). Three in twenty, (14.8%) participants were none adherent to Option B plus ART due to difficulty in adopting time schedule and forgetting to take medication. During first trimester of pregnancy, 16 (5.5%) were stopped taking ART medication due to side effects. Pregnant women who started ART at the time of HIV diagnosis [AOR=1.99, 95% CI: (1.02, 3.95)], and who had five or more antenatal care visits [AOR=4.10, 95% CI (1.65, 10.02)] were more likely to adhere to option B plus ART. Women who should travel 30-60min on foot to access ART from service delivering facilities were less likely to adhere to option B plus [AOR=0.39, 95% C I: (0.17, 0.88)].ConclusionsThe overall adherence to option B plus ART was suboptimal. Measures that improve recalling ability of individuals to take ART on time, and minimize ART side effects during first trimester of pregnancy need to be given emphasis. The study finding indicates the need for reconsidering the ad-hoc focused antenatal care visit at policy and program level by increasing the number of follow up visit with proper counseling on ART adherence benefits, and improving service accessibility.

AB Background: Disproportionately high rates of maternal overweight and obesity among the Hispanic population before, during, and after pregnancy pose serious health concerns for both mothers (e.g., preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, weight retention) and children (e.g., elevated lifelong obesity risk). A growing body of evidence implicates environmental exposures (e.g., air pollution, metals) and social stressors (e.g., poverty, violence) in contributing to obesity-related biobehavioral processes, such as physical activity, dietary intake, perceived stress, and cortisol regulation. However, current understanding of the role of environmental exposures and social stressors on obesity-related biobehavioral processes is limited by infrequent, inter-individual measurement, and lack of personal exposure monitoring.
   Methods: The "Maternal and Developmental Risks from Environmental and Social Stressors" (MADRES) real-time and personal sampling study examines the within-subject day-level effects of environmental and social stressors on maternal pre- and post-partum obesity-related biobehavioral responses. Among a cohort of 65 low-income, Hispanic women in urban Los Angeles, this study uses innovative personal, real-time data capture strategies (e.g., ecological momentary assessment [EMA], personal exposure monitoring, geolocation monitoring, accelerometry) to repeatedly assess obesity-related processes during the 1st and 3rd trimester, and at 4-6 months postpartum. Day-level effects of environmental exposures and social stressors on women's physical activity, diet, perceived stress and salivary cortisol measured across repeated days will be tested using multilevel modeling.
   Discussion: Hispanic women of childbearing age bear a disproportionately high burden of obesity, and this population is also unduly exposed to numerous obesogenic settings. By using innovative real-time data capture strategies, the current study will uncover the daily impacts of environmental and social stressor exposures on women's obesity-related biobehavioral responses, which over time can lead to excessive gestational weight gain, postpartum weight retention and can pose serious consequences for both mother and child. Findings from the real-time and personal sampling study will identify key mechanistic targets for policy, clinical, and programmatic interventions, with the potential for broad-reaching public health impacts.

   LAND-USE; NEIGHBORHOOD; URBAN; OBESITY; DISPARITIES; PREVALENCE
AB Background: Active travel to and from a transit station may provide significant amounts of physical activity and improve health. The ease with which people can traverse the distance to the transit station may impede or support active travel. Therefore, transit stations that have features that are supportive of utilitarian physical activity would be desirable. This study aimed to characterize the built environment surrounding new light rail transit (LRT) stations in the City of Houston, Texas.
   Methods: In 2014, we used a series of systematic protocols and a standardized environmental audit instrument, the Analytic Audit Tool, to collect data on segments (streets) that surround 22 LRT stations that were being newly built. Using Geographic Information System (GIS), we assembled all the segments that intersect a 0.25-mile circular buffer around each station for the audit exercise. Several 3- to 4-member teams of trained auditors completed the audit exercise on a subset of these identified segments. Our analysis were descriptive in nature. We provided the frequency distributions of audited features across the study area. We also followed an original algorithm to produce several composite index scores for our study area. The composite index score is indicative of the prevalence of physical activity friendly/unfriendly features in the study area.
   Results: In all, we audited a total of 590 segments covering a total of 218 US Census blocks, and eight City of Houston super neighborhoods. Findings suggest the environment around the new LRT stations may not be supportive of physical activity. In general, the audited segments lacked land use integration; had abandoned buildings, had uneven sidewalks; were not bike-friendly, had minimal presence of public-recreational facilities that would support physical activity; and had significant physical disorder. Notably, certain attractive and comfort features were frequently to usually available.
   Conclusions: Current findings, which will be compared to follow-up audit data, can be useful for future researchers and practitioners interested in the built environment around LRT stations.

DE Adaptation; Climate change; Index; Validation; Flooding
ID HEALTH IMPACTS; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY
AB Background: In the current context of climate change, climate forecasts for the province of Quebec (Canada) are a lengthening of the thunderstorm season and an increase in episodes of intense precipitations. These changes in the distribution of precipitations could heighten the intensity or frequency of floods, a natural hazard that concerns 80% of Quebec's riverside municipalities. For the health and safety of the at-risk population, it is very important to make sure they have acquired necessary adaptive behaviors against flooding hazard. However, there has been no assessment of these flood adaptation behaviors to date. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop and validate five indices of adaptation to flooding.
   Methods: A sample of 1951 adults completed a questionnaire by phone. The questionnaire, specifically developed for this study, measured whether they did or did not adopt the behaviors that are proposed by public health officials to protect themselves against flooding.
   Results: The results of the item, confirmatory factor, and multiple correspondence analyses contributed to the development of five indices corresponding to the adaptation behaviors to adopt according to the chronology of events: (a) pre-alert preventive behaviors, (b) behaviors to carry out after the alert is issued, (c) behaviors to adopt during a flood not requiring evacuation, (d) behaviors to adopt during a flood requiring evacuation, and (e) post-flood behaviors. The results of this study also showed that people who perceive a risk of flooding in their home in the next 5 years tend to adopt more preventive behaviors and adaptation behaviors than those who perceive little or no risk at all. They also reveal that people who feel more adverse effects on their physical or mental health tend to adopt more adaptive behaviors than those who feel little or no adverse effects on their health.
   Conclusion: Across a series of psychometric analyses, the results showed that these flood adaptation indices could properly measure a vast range of adaptive behaviors according to the chronology of events. Therefore, researchers, public health agencies, and professionals can use them to monitor the evolution of individuals' adaptive behaviors during floods.

AB BackgroundInfestations with scabies mites are a global burden affecting individuals of all ages, classes and ethnicities. As poor sanitation and overcrowding favor the transmission of this highly contagious disease, epidemic outbreaks are frequently observed among displaced persons and asylum seekers. Due to the growing influx of refugees during the last years, public health authorities in host countries are frequently confronted with the challenge to treat individuals with diagnosed or suspected scabies promptly and effectively to avoid further spreading of the infestation.This study aimed to establish a straightforward and efficient algorithm for rapid screening and treatment of large numbers of patients with confirmed or suspected scabies infestations.MethodsForty-eight individuals (58% males, mean age 22.4yrs.) from Syria with suspected scabies infestation were allocated to 3 colour-coded groups: (1) no signs or symptoms of infestation, (2) itch only, and (3) itch and typical skin lesions. Patients were treated with a single (group 1) or two doses of oral ivermectin at an interval of 7days (group 2), or with a combination of 2 doses of ivermectin plus 2 applications of permethrin ointment at an interval of 7days (group 3). Follow-ups were performed 4weeks after initial treatments.ResultsAll individuals with signs and/or symptoms of infestation had improved skin lesion; in 10/11 (90.9%) lesion had completely resolved. All individuals with initial itch only (n=32) reported improvement of its intensity or complete resolution. None of the patients of group 1 developed itch or skin lesions. The algorithm was reapplied in 4 individuals (8.3%) after 4weeks and the outbreak was completely controlled after 8weeks. Colour-coding ensured fast flow of information between health-care providers at the interfaces of the algorithm.ConclusionsOur algorithm proved to be both highly efficient for treatment of large numbers of patients with suspected or diagnosed scabies infestation as well as for prevention of spreading of the disease. Hence, this algorithm is well suited for the management of scabies mass outbreaks.

AB BackgroundHealthcare-associated infection (HAI) is a major public health problem. As a form of prevention and control, preparations of chlorhexidine are used extensively; however, the reduction of susceptibility to chlorhexidine has been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the susceptibility to chlorhexidine and the distribution of the qacA/B genes in 211 clinical isolates of coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS).MethodsCoNS were identified by conventional biochemical tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by disk-diffusion. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of chlorhexidine was determined by agar dilution test; detection of the qacA/B and mecA genes were evaluated by PCR.ResultsThe most frequently isolated species were S. epidermidis, S. hominis hominis, S. auricularis, and S. haemolyticus, respectively. The strains presented a multidrug resistance profile of 87%, including methicillin resistance. Reduced susceptibility to chlorhexidine was observed in 31%. The qacA/B genes were detected in samples resistant (32/32) and susceptible (17/32) to chlorhexidine. The vast majority (94%) of the samples with reduced susceptibility to chlorhexidine were multidrug resistant.ConclusionsOur results show that qacA/B genes are not restricted to strains expressing chlorhexidine resistance. Further studies are needed to understand how the expression of these genes occurs.

ID ACTIVE ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; OUTCOMES; DELIVERY; WEIGHTS
AB BackgroundEach year, an estimated 15 million babies are born preterm, a global burden borne disproportionately by families in lower-income countries. Maternal HIV infection increases a woman's risk of delivering prematurely, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) may compound this risk. While prenatal progesterone prophylaxis prevents preterm birth among some high-risk women, it is unknown whether HIV-infected women could benefit from this therapy. We are studying the efficacy of progesterone supplementation to reduce the risk of preterm birth among pregnant women with HIV in Lusaka, Zambia.MethodsThe Improving Pregnancy Outcomes with Progesterone (IPOP) study is a Phase III double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of intramuscular 17-alpha hydroxprogesterone caproate (17P) to prevent preterm birth in HIV-infected women. A total of 800 women will be recruited prior to 24weeks ofgestation and randomly allocated to 17P or placebo administered by weekly intramuscular injection. The primary outcome will be a composite of live birth prior to 37 completed gestational weeks or stillbirth at any gestational age. Secondary outcomes will include very preterm birth (<34weeks), extreme preterm birth (<28weeks), small for gestational age (<10th centile), low birth weight (<2500g), and neonatal outcomes. In secondary analysis, we will assess whether specific HIV-related covariates, including the timing of maternal ART initiation relative to conception, is associated with progesterone's prophylactic efficacy, if any.DiscussionWe hypothesize that weekly prenatal 17P will reduce the risk of HIV-related preterm birth. An inexpensive intervention to prevent preterm birth among pregnant women with HIV could have substantial global public health impact.Trial registrationNCT03297216; September 29, 2017.

TI Economic and public health impact of decentralized HIV viral load
   testing: A modelling study in Kenya
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID FOLLOW-UP; CARE
AB Kenya has the world's 4th largest HIV burden. Various strategies to control the epidemic have been implemented, including the implementation of viral load (VL) testing to monitor HIV patients on ARVs. Like many resource limited settings, Kenya's healthcare system faces serious challenges in effectively providing quality health services to its population. Increased investments to strengthen the country's capacity to diagnose, monitor and treat diseases, particularly HIV and TB, continue to be made but are still inadequate in the face of global health goals like the UNAIDS 90:90:90 which require scaling up of VL tests amid existing constraints. In Kenya, there is an increase in the demand for VL tests amidst these existing constraints. The GeneXpert system is a diagnostic point-of-care technology that can quantify, amongst others, HIV VL. Currently, GeneXpert technology is widely distributed in Kenya for testing of tuberculosis. This study aimed to determine the economic and public health impact of incorporating VL test modules on the existing GeneXpert infrastructure. Markov models were constructed for different populations (non-pregnant adults, pregnant women and children). The scenarios analysed were 100% centralized VL testing compared to 50% GeneXpert plus 50% centralized VL testing, with time horizons of 5 years for the adult and child populations, and 31 months for the pregnant population. Incremental effectiveness was measured in terms of the number of HIV transmissions or opportunistic infections avoided when implementing the GeneXpert scenario compared to a 100% centralized scenario. The model indicated that, for all three populations combined, the GeneXpert scenario resulted in 117 less HIV transmissions and 393 less opportunistic infections. The cost decreased by $21,978,755 for the non-pregnant and pregnant adults and $22,808,533 for non-pregnant adults, pregnant adults and children. The model showed that GeneXpert would cost less and be more effective in terms of total cost per HIV transmission avoided and the total cost per opportunistic infection avoided, except for the pregnant population, when considered separately.

ID PPAR-GAMMA; WIP1; DIFFERENTIATION; CYCLE
AB Obesity is a worldwide public health problem, which is associated with various severe diseases including diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and cancer. Recent studies have revealed that combination treatment of several different compounds using low doses is effective to reduce side effects. Thus, there is a need to develop an efficient inhibitor for reducing lipid droplets with a divergent target/pathway. Ser/Thr protein phosphatase PPM1D is involved in cellular metabolic processes and is a promising target for anti-obesity treatment. We have previously developed a potent and specific PPM1D inhibitor, SL-176. In this study, we demonstrated that significant reduction of lipid droplet formation in adipocytes by the PPM1D specific inhibitor, SL-176. Using Oil-red O staining and fluorescent imaging of lipid droplet, we found that treatment of SL-176 significantly suppressed lipid droplet formation of 3T3-L1 cells both in amount and in size. SL-176 also repressed mRNA and protein expression of PPAR gamma and C/EBP alpha, adipogenic markers, at nontoxic conditions. Thus, SL-176 is a unique and potent inhibitor of lipid droplet formation that acts via PPM1D, a novel target toward inhibiting adipocyte differentiation.

TI Perceived HIV-protective benefits of male circumcision: Risk
   compensatory behaviour among women in Malawi
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PREVENTION; MEN
AB Background
   Male circumcision (MC) reduces men's risk of contracting HIV by approximately 60% and has the potential to significantly alter HIV epidemics. However, MC does not significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission to women from a circumcised man. In Malawi, several researchers has examined the acceptability, accessibility and sexual behaviour change after circumcision in men but behaviour change in women following their partner's circumcision remains uncertain. In order to fully realise the protective benefits of MC against HIV, factors related to risky sexual behaviour is imperative as some studies have shown potentials of increased risky behaviour in men following voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC). This study aimed to explore the perceptions and opinions of female school teachers and health workers on HIV-protective benefits of MC and its impact on risk compensatory behaviour among women in Malawi.
   Methods
   We conducted a cross-sectional survey of women (N = 68) between May and June 2016 in three districts of southern Malawi. Risk compensatory behaviour was measured by number of sexual partners and use of protection during sex among female teachers and health care workers who are involved with educating people on benefits of VMMC. The bivariable analysis was conducted to test for association between HIV-protective benefits and risk compensatory behaviour. Purposive sampling was used to conduct eight qualitative in-depth interviews with women from the selected districts and the qualitative data was analysed thematically.
   Results
   The mean age of women who participated in the survey was 30 years. Most women (94.1%) correctly indicated that HIV-positive circumcised men can still infect their partner and approximately, 90% of were knowledgeable of risky sexual behaviour for HIV. However, 55.9% perceived MC can lead women to adopt risky sexual behaviour. On the contrary to this finding, qualitative data indicate women's misconceptions regarding their partners' circumcision and HIV-protective benefits. Most women expressed that risky sexual behaviour such as having multiple sexual partners and inconsistent or non-use of condoms can easily be observed among women if they learn of their partners' partial HIV-protective benefits circumcision.
   Conclusion
   Exploring women's sexual behaviour change in the right of HIV-protective benefits of MC fills in a research knowledge important to public health. In-depth studies are therefore required to give more evidence that will guide the development of HIV risk-reduction interventions.

TI Assessing the health risks of consuming 'sachet' alcohol in Acoli,
   Uganda
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID DISPLACED PERSONS; CANCER; CONSUMPTION; DRINKING; ALUMINUM; BLOOD
AB The increased mortality rate among the Acoli people of northern Uganda is anecdotally blamed on excessive consumption of cheap and widely available sachet-packaged alcohol in the region. In this paper, we quantify this perceived association by determining statistically the health risks associated with ingesting 20 heavy metals in 17 popular spirits products consumed in Acoli. Thirteen of these products were industrially packaged in sachets (locally known as 'sachet,' waragi, arege or moo lyec) and four were locally produced Lira-Lira spirits from Bolo, Awere and Teso Bar in the region and Nsambya in southern Uganda. A Scottish whisky purchased in San Diego (USA) was our reference. Risk assessment was performed according to standardized protocols developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). Our results show that a strong correlation indeed exists between health risks and ingestion of spirits in Acoli. At >2.5 sachets/day for 240 day/year over a lifetime for example, the risk of developing cancer due to exposure to As, Pb and Cr alone is 1 in 102,041. This estimate excludes ethanol, a known carcinogen, and 17 heavy metals also studied due to lack of their cancer slope factors. The primary non-cancer related health risk factor in all samples tested is ethanol with unacceptably high health index of four. The Lira-Lira spirits, with 100-6000% copper above the US EPA limit for intake by oral ingestion in water, would be the 'cleanest'without copper and at par with the Scottish whisky. Collectively, we find that no amount of alcohol consumed in Acoli is safe. Preventive measures are therefore recommended to reduce mortality in Acoli in particular, and in Uganda in general. These measures should include public education, better public policies, creating productive economic activities other than brewing alcohol, and social activities that engage people away from drinking.

AB The UK is one of the largest funders of health research in the world, but little is known about how health funding is spent. Our study explores whether major UK public and charitable health research funders support the research of UK-based scientists producing the most highly-cited research. To address this question, we searched for UK-based authors of peer-reviewed papers that were published between January 2006 and February 2018 and received over 1000 citations in Scopus. We explored whether these authors have held a grant from the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Wellcome Trust and compared the results with UK-based researchers who serve currently on the boards of these bodies. From the 1,370 papers relevant to medical, biomedical, life and health sciences with more than 1000 citations in the period examined, we identified 223 individuals from a UK institution at the time of publication who were either first/last or single authors. Of those, 164 are still in UK academic institutions, while 59 are not currently in UK academia (have left the country, are retired, or work in other sectors). Of the 164 individuals, only 59 (36%; 95% CI: 29-43%) currently hold an active grant from one of the three funders. Only 79 (48%; 95% CI: 41-56%) have held an active grant from any of the three funders between 2006-2017. Conversely, 457 of the 664 board members of MRC, Wellcome Trust, and NIHR (69%; 95% CI: 65-72%) have held an active grant in the same period by any of these funders. Only 7 out of 655 board members (1.1%) were first, last or single authors of an extremely highly-cited paper. There are many reasons why the majority of the most influential UK authors do not hold a grant from the country's major public and charitable funding bodies. Nevertheless, the results are worrisome and subscribe to similar patterns shown in the US. We discuss possible implications and suggest ways forward.

AB BackgroundSequencing-based detection and characterization of viruses in complex samples can suffer from lack of sensitivity due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, low titer, small genome size, and contribution of host or environmental nucleic acids. Hybridization-based target enrichment is one potential method for increasing the sensitivity of viral detection via high-throughput sequencing.ResultsThis study expands upon two previously developed panels of virus enrichment probes (for filoviruses and for respiratory viruses) to include other viruses of biodefense and/or biosurveillance concern to the U.S. Department of Defense and various international public health agencies. The newly expanded and combined panel is tested using carefully constructed synthetic metagenomic samples that contain clinically relevant amounts of viral genetic material. Target enrichment results in a dramatic increase in sensitivity for virus detection as compared to shotgun sequencing, yielding full, deeply covered viral genomes from materials with Ct values suggesting that amplicon sequencing would be likely to fail. Increased pooling to improve cost- and time-effectiveness does not negatively affect the ability to obtain full-length viral genomes, even in the case of co-infections, although as expected, it does decrease depth of coverage.ConclusionsHybridization-based target enrichment is an effective solution to obtain full-length viral genomes for samples from which virus detection would fail via unbiased, shotgun sequencing or even via amplicon sequencing. As the development and testing of probe sets for viral target enrichment expands and continues, the application of this technique, in conjunction with deeper pooling strategies, could make high-throughput sequencing more economical for routine use in biosurveillance, biodefense and outbreak investigations.

AB BackgroundThe state of SAo Paulo recorded a significant reduction in infant mortality from 1990 to 2013, but the desired reduction in maternal mortality was not achieved. Knowledge of the factors with impact on these indicators would be of help in formulating public policies. The aims of this study were to evaluate the relations between socioeconomic and demographic factors, health care model and both infant mortality (considering the neonatal and post-neonatal dimensions) and maternal mortality in the state of SAo Paulo, Brazil.MethodsIn this ecological study, data from national official open sources were used to conduct a population-based study. The units analyzed were 645 municipalities in the state of SAo Paulo, Brazil. For each municipality, the infant mortality (in both neonatal and post-neonatal dimensions) and maternal mortality rates were calculated for every 1000 live births, referring to 2013. Subsequently, the association between these rates, socioeconomic variables, demographic models and the primary care organization model in the municipality were verified. For statistical analysis, we used the zero-inflated negative binomial model. Gross analysis was performed and then multiple regression models were estimated. For associations, we adopted p at 5%.ResultsThe increase in the HDI of the city and proportion of Family Health Care Strategy implemented were significantly associated with the reduction in both infant mortality (neonatal + post-neonatal) and maternal mortality rates. In turn, the increase in birth and caesarean delivery rates were associated with the increase in infant and maternal mortality rates.ConclusionsIt was concluded that the Family Health Care Strategy was a Primary Care organization model that contributed to the reduction in infant (neonatal + post-neonatal) and maternal mortality rates, and so did actors such as HDI and cesarean section. Thus, public health managers should prefer this model when planning the organization of Primary Care services for the population.

AB BackgroundCross-cultural educational initiatives for professionals are now commonplace across a variety of sectors including health care. A growing number of studies have attempted to explore the utility of such initiatives on workplace behaviors and client outcomes. Yet few studies have explored how professionals perceive cross-cultural educational models (e.g., cultural awareness, cultural competence) and the extent to which they (and their organizations) execute the principles in practice. In response, this study aimed to explore the general perspectives of health care professionals on culturally competent care, their experiences working with multi-cultural patients, their own levels of cultural competence and the extent to which they believe their workplaces address cross-cultural challenges.MethodsThe perspectives and experiences of a sample of 56 health care professionals across several health care systems from a Mid-Western state in the United States were sourced via a 19-item questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised both open-ended questions and multiple choice items. Percentages across participant responses were calculated for multiple choice items. A thematic analysis of open-ended responses was undertaken to identify dominant themes.ResultsParticipants largely expressed confidence in their ability to meet the needs of multi-cultural clientele despite almost half the sample not having undergone formal cross-cultural training. The majority of the sample appeared to view cross-cultural education from a cultural awareness' perspective - effective cross-cultural care was often defined in terms of possessing useful cultural knowledge (e.g., norms and customs) and facilitating communication (the use of interpreters); in other words, from an immediate practical standpoint. The principles of systemic cross-cultural approaches (e.g., cultural competence, cultural safety) such as a recognition of racism, power imbalances, entrenched majority culture biases and the need for self-reflexivity (awareness of one's own prejudices) were scarcely acknowledged by study participants.ConclusionsFindings indicate a need for interventions that acknowledge the value of cultural awareness-based approaches, while also exploring the utility of more comprehensive cultural competence and safety approaches.

LA English

DE Chikungunya; Travellers; Prospective
ID DISEASES; FEVER
AB BackgroundChikungunya is an arthropod-borne viral disease now identified in over 60 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has spread in the last 15years to many countries, causing large local outbreaks. CHIKV infection can be clinically misdiagnosed in areas where dengue and/or Zika infections occur. Prospective studies are necessary to calculate the true incidence rate of CHIKV infection in travellers. The aim of this study was to obtain the attack and incidence rates of CHIKV infection among long-term travellers and identify associated risk factors.MethodsA previously collected prospective cohort of Dutch long-term travellers (12-52weeks) to subtropical and tropical countries was tested. From December 2008 to September 2011, participants were recruited at the travel clinic of the Public Health Service Amsterdam. A weekly diary was kept during travel in which participants recorded their itinerary, symptoms, and physician visits. On return, their pre- and post-travel blood samples were tested for the presence of IgG antibodies to CHIKV antigen. Seroconversions were confirmed by an in-house CHIKV neutralisation test.ResultsThe median age of 603 participants was 25years (interquartile range [IQR]: 23-29); 35.7% were male; median travel duration was 20weeks (IQR: 15-25), and purpose of travel was predominantly tourism (62%).The presence of anti-CHIKV IgG in the pre-travel sample, suggestive of previous CHIKV infection, was found for 3/603 participants (0.5%); all three had been previously travelling in either Africa or Asia. In one traveler who visited Latin America, a seroconversion was found (0.2%) but the CHIKV neutralisation test was negative, making the incidence rate 0.ConclusionNo chikungunya virus infections were found in this 2008-2011 prospective cohort of long-term travellers. We recommend the research be repeated, particularly as the sample size of our cohort might have been too small. Also, extensive spread of chikungunya virus has likely increased incidence rates among travellers since 2013.

Blastocystis, Giardia duodenalis, Cryptosporidium spp. and the Entamoeba complex (Entamoeba histolytica, Entamoeba dispar and Entamoeba moshkovskii) are the most common etiological causes of intestinal parasitic infections.MethodsWe carried out a descriptive cross-sectional study in school-age children attending a daycare institution in commune eight of Popayan, Cauca (Southwest Colombia). A total of 266 fecal samples were collected (258 from children and eight from pets). Blastocystis, G. duodenalis, Cryptosporidium spp. and the Entamoeba complex were identified by microscopy, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and conventional PCR. The concordance of qPCR and microscopy was assessed using the Kappa index. Molecular characterization was conducted to identify Blastocystis subtypes (18S), G. duodenalis assemblages (tpi and gdh) and Cryptosporidium species/subtypes (18S and GP60). Potential associations between intestinal parasitism and sociodemographic factors were examined using bivariate analyses.ResultsA total of 258 fecal samples from children were analyzed by microscopy and 255 samples were analyzed by qPCR. The prevalence of Blastocystis was between 25.19% (microscopy) and 39.22% (qPCR), that of G. duodenalis was between 8.14% (microscopy) and 10.59% (qPCR), that of Cryptosporidium spp. was estimated at 9.8% (qPCR), and that of the Entamoeba complex was between 0.39% (conventional PCR) and 0.78% (microscopy). The concordance between microscopy and qPCR was very low. Blastocystis ST1 (alleles 4, 8, and 80), ST2 (alleles 11, 12, and 15), ST3 (alleles 31, 34, 36, 38,57, and 151), and ST4 (alleles 42 and 91), G. duodenalis assemblages AII, BIII, BIV and D, C. parvum subtype IIa and C. hominis subtype IbA9G3R2 were identified. The only identified member of the Entamoeba complex corresponded to E. histolytica. No statistically significant association was identified between parasitic infection and any sociodemographic variable.ConclusionThis study revealed the usefulness of molecular methods to depict the transmission dynamics of parasitic protozoa in southwest Colombia. The presence of some of these protozoa in domestic animals may be involved in their transmission.

AB BackgroundPrecarious status migrants are a group of persons who are vulnerable, heterogeneous, and often suspicious of research teams. They are underrepresented in population-based research projects, and strategies to recruit them are described exclusively in terms of a single cultural group. We analyzed the recruitment strategies implemented during a research project aimed at understanding precarious status migrants' health status and healthcare access in Montreal, Canada. The research sample consisted of 854 persons recruited from a variety of ethnocultural communities between June 2016 and September 2017. This article analyzes the strategies implemented by the research team to respond to the challenges of that recruitment, and assess the effectiveness of those strategies. Based on the results, we share the lessons learned with a view to increasing precarious status migrants' representation in research.MethodA mixed sequential design was used to combine qualitative data gathered from members of the research team at a reflexive workshop (n=16) and in individual interviews (n=15) with qualitative and quantitative data collected using the conceptual mapping method (n=10).ResultsThe research team encountered challenges in implementing the strategies, related to the identification of the target population, the establishment of community partnerships, and suspicion on the part of the individuals approached. The combination of a venue-based sampling method, a communications strategy, and the snowball sampling method was key to the recruitment. Linking people with resources that could help them was useful in obtaining their effective and non-instrumental participation in the study. Creating a diverse and multicultural team helped build trust with participants. However, the strategy of matching the ethnocultural identity of the interviewer with that of the respondent was not systematically effective.ConclusionThe interviewers' experience and their understanding of the issue are important factors to take into consideration in future research. More over, the development of a community resource guide tailored to the needs of participants should be major components of any research project targeting migrants. Finally, strategies should be implemented as the result of a continuous reflexive process among all members of the research team.

AB BackgroundEquity-focused health impact assessment (EFHIA) can function as a framework and tool that supports users to collate data, information, and evidence related to health equity in order to identify and mitigate the impact of a current or proposed initiative on health inequities. Despite education efforts in both the clinical and public health settings, practitioners have found implementation and the use of evidence in completing equity focussed assessment tools to be challenging.MethodsWe conducted a realist evaluation of evidence use in EFHIA in three phases: 1) developing propositions informed by a literature scan, existing theoretical frameworks, and stakeholder engagement; 2) data collection at four case study sites using online surveys, semi-structured interviews, document analysis, and observation; and 3) a realist analysis and identification of context-mechanism-outcome patterns and demi-regularities.ResultsWe identified limited use of academic evidence in EFHIA with two explanatory demi-regularities: 1) participants were unable to identify with academic sources, acknowledging that evidence based practice and use of academic literature was valued in their organization, but seen as less likely to provide answers needed for practice and 2) use of academic evidence was not associated with a perceived positive return on investment of participant energy and time. However, we found that knowledge brokering at the local site can facilitate evidence familiarity and manageability, increase user confidence in using evidence, and increase the likelihood of evidence use in future work.ConclusionsThe findings of this study provide a realist perspective on evidence use in practice, specifically for EFHIA. These findings can inform ongoing development and refinement of various knowledge translation interventions, particularly for practitioners delivering front-line public health services.

TI Tweeting about public health policy: Social media response to the UK
   Government's announcement of a Parliamentary vote on draft standardised
   packaging regulations
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID TOBACCO; TWITTER; WARNINGS; IMPLEMENTATION; INFORMATION
AB Background
   Standardised tobacco packaging has been, and remains, a contentious policy globally, attracting corporate, public health, political, media and popular attention. In January 2015, the UK Government announced it would vote on draft regulations for the policy before the May 2015 General Election. We explored reactions to the announcement on Twitter, in comparison with an earlier period of little UK Government activity on standardised packaging.
   Methods
   We obtained a random sample of 1038 tweets in two 4-week periods, before and after the UK Government's announcement. Content analysis was used to examine the following Tweet characteristics: support for the policy, purpose, Twitter-user's geographical location and affiliation, and evidence citation and quality. Chi-squared analyses were used to compare Tweet characteristics between the two periods.
   Results
   Overall, significantly more sampled Tweets were in favour of the policy (49%) in comparison to those opposed (19%). Yet, at Time 2, following the announcement, a greater proportion of sampled tweets opposed standardised packaging compared to the period sampled at Time 1, prior to the announcement (p<0.001). The quality of evidence and research cited in URLs linked at Time 2 was significantly lower than at Time 1 (p<0.001), with peer-reviewed research more likely to be shared in positive Tweets (p<0.001) and in Tweets linking to URLs originating from the health sector (p<0.001). The decline in the proportion of positive Tweets was mirrored by a reduction in Tweets by health sector Twitter-users at Time 2 (p<0.001).
   Conclusions
   Microblogging sites can reflect offline policy debates and are used differently by policy proponents and opponents dependent on the policy context. Twitter-users opposed to standardised packaging increased their activity following the Government's announcement, while those in support broadly maintained their rate of Twitter engagement. The findings offer insight into the public health community's options for using Twitter to influence policy and disseminate research. In particular, proliferation of Twitter activity following pro-public health policy announcements could be considered to ensure pro-health messages are not overshadowed by anti-regulation voices.

AB BackgroundDiagnosing dementia, a syndrome affecting 35.6 million people worldwide, can be challenging, especially in patients with a migrant background. Language barriers and language-based diagnostic tools, cultural differences in the perception of the syndrome as well as restricted access to healthcare can influence medical care. For the first time in Germany, this study investigates whether German general practitioners (GPs) feel prepared to meet the diagnostic needs of these patient groups and whether there are challenges and support needs.MethodsA cross-sectional study among a random sample of 982 general practitioners in Germany was conducted from October 2017 to January 2018 (response rate: 34.5%). A self-developed, written, standardised questionnaire was used. Descriptive statistics as well as multiple logistic regression analyses were performed using data of 326 GPs.ResultsNinety-six percent of GPs reported having experienced barriers at least once. Uncertainties in diagnosing dementia in patients with a migrant background were indicated by 70.9%. There was no significant association between uncertainties in diagnosing dementia and GPs' sociodemographic characteristics. The most frequently reported barriers were language barriers that affected or prevented diagnostics (89.3%) and information deficits in patients with a migrant background (59.2%). Shameful interaction or lack of acceptance of the syndrome was also common (55.5%). A demand for more information about the topic was expressed by 70.6% of GPs.ConclusionsPublic health measures supporting GPs in their interaction with patients with a migrant background as well as information and services for dementia patients are needed. Efforts to facilitate access to interpreting services and to focus on people with a migrant background in healthcare are necessary.Trial registrationGerman Clinical Trials Register: DRKS00012503, date of registration: 05/09/2017 (German Institute of Medical Documentation and Information.

AB Background
   The 'Primary HIV Prevention among Pregnant and Lactating Ugandan Women' (PRIMAL) study aimed to assess the effectiveness of an enhanced HIV counseling intervention for preventing HIV acquisition among HIV-uninfected mothers during pregnancy and throughout the breastfeeding period.
   Methods
   We conducted an unblinded randomized control trial between 22 February 2013 and 22 April 2016 to assess the effectiveness of an extended repeat HIV testing and enhanced counseling (ERHTEC) intervention aimed at preventing primary HIV infection among HIV-uninfected pregnant and lactating women in Uganda. HIV-uninfected pregnant women aged 15-49 were enrolled 1:1 individually or in couples together with their partner. Enrolled women and couples were randomized 1:1 to an intervention (ERHTEC) or control (extended repeat HIV testing and standard counseling) group and followed up to 24 months postpartum or six weeks past complete cessation of breastfeeding, whichever came first. Both groups were tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV at enrollment, delivery, 3 and 6 months postpartum and every 6 months thereafter until the end of follow-up. The intervention group received enhanced HIV prevention counseling every 3 months throughout follow-up. The control group received standard counseling at the time of HIV retesting. Both intervention and control couples were offered couple HIV testing and counseling at all study visits.
   Main outcome measures
   Frequency of condom use and incidence of HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis over follow-up.
   Results
   Between February 2013 and April 2014, we enrolled 820 HIV-uninfected pregnant women presenting for antenatal care individually (n = 410) or in couples (n = 410 women and 410 partners) in one urban and one rural public Ugandan hospital. Women's median age was 24 years (IQR 20-28 years). At baseline, participants did not differ in any socio-demographic, reproductive health, HIV testing history, sexual behavior, medical history or STI status characteristics; 96% (386/402) of couples were tested and counseled for HIV together with their partners at enrolment, 2.1% (7/329) of whom were found to be HIV-infected. Six hundred twenty-five (76%) women completed follow-up as per protocol (S1 Protocol). Women were followed for an average of 1.76 years and cumulated 1,439 women-years of follow-up or 81% of the maximum 1,779 women-years of follow-up assuming no dropouts. Men were followed for an average of 1.72 years.
   The frequency of consistent condom use and the proportion of women who used condoms over the last 3 months or at last vaginal sex increased substantially over follow-up in both arms, but there were no statistically significant differences in increases between the intervention and control arms.
   During follow-up, on average 42% (range 36%-46%) of couple partners were counseled together. Between 3.8% and 7.6% of women tested positive at any follow-up visit for any STI including syphilis, gonorrhea, C. trachomatis or T. vaginalis. Four women (two in each arm) and no enrolled men became infected with HIV, representing an overall HIV incidence rate of 0.186 per 100 person-years. Three of the women seroconverters had enrolled individually, one as a couple. At or before seroconversion, all four women reported their partners had extramarital relationships and/or had not disclosed their suspected HIV-infected status. There were no statistically significant differences between study arms for STI or HIV incidences.
   Conclusions
   A sustained enhanced HIV prevention counseling intervention for up to 2 years postpartum among pregnant and breastfeeding women did not have a statistically significant effect on condom use or HIV incidence among these women. However, in both study arms, condom use increased over follow-up while STI and HIV incidence remained very low when compared to similar cohorts in and outside Uganda, suggesting that repeat HIV testing during breastfeeding, whether with enhanced or standard counseling, may have had an unintended HIV preventive effect among pregnant and lactating women in this setting. Further research is needed to verify this hypothesis.

AB BackgroundComprehensive national joint replacement registries with well-validated data offer unique opportunities for examining the potential future burden of hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) at a population level. This study aimed to forecast the burden of primary total knee (TKR) and hip replacements (THR) performed for OA in Australia to the year 2030, and to model the impact of contrasting obesity scenarios on TKR burden.MethodsDe-identified TKR and THR data for 2003-2013 were obtained from the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry. Population projections and obesity trends were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, with public and private hospital costs sourced from the National Hospital Cost Data Collection. Procedure rates were projected according to two scenarios: (1) constant rate of surgery from 2013 onwards; and (2) continued growth in surgery rates based on 2003-2013 growth. Sensitivity analyses were used to estimate future TKR burden if: (1) obesity rates continued to increase linearly; or (2) 1-5% of the overweight or obese population attained a normal body mass index.ResultsBased on recent growth, the incidence of TKR and THR for OA is estimated to rise by 276% and 208%, respectively, by 2030. The total cost to the healthcare system would be $AUD5.32 billion, of which $AUD3.54 billion relates to the private sector. Projected growth in obesity rates would result in 24,707 additional TKRs totalling $AUD521 million. A population-level reduction in obesity could result in up to 8062 fewer procedures and cost savings of up to $AUD170 million.ConclusionsIf surgery trends for OA continue, Australia faces an unsustainable joint replacement burden by 2030, with significant healthcare budget and health workforce implications. Strategies to reduce national obesity could produce important TKR savings.

AB Leishmania infantum causes zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL) in the Mediterranean basin and South America. The parasite has been shown to co-infect HIV patients and an outbreak in central Spain was reported in the last decade. Therfore, ZVL is a public health problem, dogs being the parasite's reservoir. We have developed a DNA vaccine based on the L. infantum activated protein kinase A receptor (LACK) using different plasmid vectors and vaccinia virus strains as vehicles. Recently, we have generated an antibiotic resistance marker-free plasmid vector called pPAL. Homologous pPAL-LACK prime-boost vaccination protects Beagle dogs as well as a heterologous plasmid-virus regime. For both reasons, pPAL improves safety. IL12 was described to trigger Th1 response through IFN-. production in infected dogs, being a good candidate for cytokine therapy in conventional treatmentunresponsive dogs. Herein, we report a complete protection study in dogs through inoculation of genes encoding for the p35 and p40 subunits which compose canine IL12 in combination with the LACK gene. A homologous plasmid-plasmid regime using independent pPAL constructs for each gene was inoculated in a 15-day interval. The infectious challenge using L. infantum promastigotes was successful. The outcome was pPAL-LACK vaccine protection suppression by IL12 administration. The important implications of this finding are discussed in the manuscript.

TI Positive predictive value of the German notification system for
   infectious diseases: Surveillance data from eight local health
   departments, Berlin, 2012
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID TIMELINESS
AB The German Infection Protection Act requires notifying certain cases of infectious diseases to local health departments (LHD) in Germany. LHDs transmit notifications meeting case definitions to the national health authority, where the proportion of discarded notifications is not known. The proportion of discarded cases at the level of LHDs can be expressed as the positive predictive value (PPV) of the notification system. The PPV can be used to assess the efficiency of the system. We quantified the proportion of discarded notifications to calculate the PPV of the German notification system at the level of LHDs using electronic notification data from Berlin LHDs from 2012. We also analysed reasons for discarding notifications by reviewing notification forms. Data was available from eight LHDs (67%) receiving 10,113 notifications in 2012. Overall PPV was 89% (minimum-maximum = 77-97% across LHDs) and ranging from 30% (Hepatitis B) to 99% (Rotavirus). Of 166 individual investigation forms 84% were on hepatitis B or C cases, most of them discarded because of previously diagnosed chronic disease. LHDs investigate many notifications that do not lead to public health action and useful surveillance data leading to inefficient use of resources. Adaptation of case definitions or the legal framework concerning notifications may increase the efficiency of the notification system and lead to better use of data from notified cases.

AB Despite their potential importance with regard to infectious and chronic diseases among tobacco users, microbial constituents of tobacco products lack characterization. Specifically, to our knowledge, there are no data describing the bacterial diversity of little cigars or cigarillos. To address this knowledge gap, we tested four brands of little cigars and cigarillos. Tobacco and wrapper subsamples (n = 132) were separately subjected to DNA extraction, followed by PCR amplification of the V3V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene, and sequencing using Illumina HiSeq. Sequences were analyzed using QIIME and Phyloseq implemented in R. We identified 2,681 operational taxonomic units across all products. Significant differences in alpha and beta diversity were observed between Swisher Sweets and Cheyenne products. Alpha and beta diversity was also significantly different between tobacco and wrapper subsamples within the same product. Beta diversity analyses of only tobacco samples identified no significant differences in the bacterial microbiota of different lots of the same products; however, the microbiota in the wrapper differed significantly across lots for all brands. Overall, Firmicutes were found to dominate in the wrapper, whereas Proteobacteria were most abundant in the tobacco. At the genus level, Bacillus and Lactobacillus dominated in the wrappers, and Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas dominated in the tobacco. Our findings suggest that the bacterial microbiota of little cigars and cigarillos is diverse and differs significantly between the tobacco and the wrapper, and across brands. Future work is necessary to evaluate the potential public health implications of these findings.

TI Effective coverage of essential antenatal care interventions: A
   cross-sectional study of public primary healthcare clinics in the West
   Bank
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID QUALITY; SERVICES
AB Background
   The proportion of women attending four or more antenatal care (ANC) visits is widely used for monitoring, but provides limited information on quality of care. Effective coverage metrics, assessing if ANC interventions are completely delivered, can identify critical gaps in healthcare service delivery. We aimed to measure coverage of at least one screening and effective coverage of ANC interventions in the public health system in the West Bank, Palestine, and to explore associations between infrastructure-related and maternal sociodemographic variables and effective coverage.
   Methods
   We used data from paper-based clinical records of 1369 pregnant women attending ANC in 17 primary healthcare clinics. Infrastructure-related variables were derived from a 2014 national inventory assessment of clinics. Sample size calculations were made to detect effective coverage ranging 40-60% with a 2-3% margin of error, clinics were selected by probability sampling. We calculated inverse probability weighted percentages of: effective coverage of appropriate number and timing of screenings of ANC interventions; and coverage of at least one screening.
   Results
   Coverage of one screening and effective coverage of ANC interventions were notably different for screening for: hypertension (98% vs. 10%); fetal growth abnormalities (66% vs. 6%); anemia (93% vs. 14%); gestational diabetes (93% vs. 34%), and antenatal ultrasound (74% vs. 24%). Clinics with a laboratory and ultrasound generally performed better in terms of effective coverage, and maternal sociodemographic factors had no associations with effective coverage estimates. Only 13% of the women attended ANC visits according to the recommended national schedule, driving effective coverage down.
   Conclusion
   Indicators for ANC monitoring and their definitions can have important consequences for quantifying health system performance and identifying issues with care provision. To achieve more effective coverage in public primary care clinics in the West Bank, efforts should be made to improve care provision according to prescribed guidelines.

   EFFICACY
AB Vector-borne diseases are an increasing issue to public health, endangering billions of people worldwide. Controlling vector mosquitoes is widely accepted as the most effective way to prevent vector-borne disease outbreaks. Mosquito surveillance is critical for the development of control strategies under the integrated vector management framework. We hypothesize that the effectiveness and reliability of using BG-Sentinel traps for the surveillance strongly depend on the bait used to attract mosquitoes. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of BG-Sentinel traps baited with CO2 and BG-Lure. A total of 72 traps were deployed for 48 hours once a week for four weeks. For the initial 24-hour period, the traps were baited with CO2, and then for an additional 24 hours using the BG-Lure. Collected mosquitoes were analyzed using the Generalized Estimating Equation for repeated measures analysis. Biodiversity was assessed by the Shannon and Simpson indices and by individual rarefaction curves and SHE profiles. A total of 5,154 mosquitoes were collected, from which 3,514 by traps baited with CO2 and 1,640 mosquitoes by traps baited with BG-Lure. Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus were the most abundant and dominant species. Results from the Generalized Estimating Equation models indicated that more than twice as many mosquitoes were attracted CO2 than to the BG-Lure. The comparison of attractiveness of CO2 and BG-Lure to Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus was non-significant, suggesting that both species were equally attracted by the baits. The individual rarefaction curves for Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus imply that traps baited with BG-Lure underestimated mosquito species richness compared to those baited with CO2. BG-Lure were less effective in attracting mosquitoes with low abundances and failed to collect Cx. coronator and Cx. nigripalpus, which were consistently collected by traps baited with CO2. According to our results, CO2 significantly (P< 0.05) attracted more mosquitoes (2.67 adjusted odds ratios) than the BG-Lure when adjusted for time and species, being more effective in assessing the relative abundance of vector mosquitoes and yielding more trustworthy results. Traps baited with CO2 collected not only more specimens, but also more species in a more consistent pattern.

ID SELF-REGULATION; MODEL; RISK
AB Despite public health measures and health-promotion efforts, the decline in tuberculosis (TB) morbidity in Japan has been slow, with a higher TB incidence rate relative to those observed in most developed countries. Because health behavior depends on multiple factors and is formulated within a social context, a theory-driven model would be necessary to increase TB prevention behavior. Based upon the Health Belief Model, this study examined the effects of health beliefs, personality traits, and social factors on TB prevention behavior among Japanese adults. A cross-sectional survey was carried out with a nationally representative sample (N = 911; 50.9% women; mean age 49.5, SD = 14.1). Path analyses gave empirical support for the hypothesized model, suggesting that TB prevention behaviors are influenced by not only perceived susceptibility to the illness but also social factors such as cues to action and one's concern to benefit others. The findings have implications for research examining health communication tailored to individual differences in personality and interpersonal concern.

AB BackgroundOrganisational performance measurement is a recognised business management tool and essential for survival and success. There is a paucity of methodological studies of organisational performance measurement relating to non-acute healthcare charities and this study is the first to suggest a set of evidence-informed organisational performance measures for the sector.MethodsThis study was designed using a two-staged approach. A systematic review of peer-reviewed journal literature between 2003 and 2016 was conducted according to the twenty-seven (27) point checklist of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) complemented by a thematic analysis of eligible data using a cutting and sorting technique to generate a set of common measures of organisational performance for non-acute health charities.ResultsNot one study was found relating to organisational performance of non-acute healthcare charities however four records met eligibility criteria relating to non-acute or primary healthcare services with charitable fundraising capability. Three were case studies of specific organisations that related their approach to organisational performance measurement, while the fourth compared a case study organisation to a public service. Three different organisational performance frameworks and 20 organisational performance measures were used across the four studies.ConclusionsThe study concluded that (1) demonstration of organisational performance is relevant to non-acute health charities; (2) organisational performance measurement is feasible in this sector; (3) an evidence-based organisational performance measurement framework for the sector has not yet been developed nor has an existing organisational performance measurement framework been adapted for the sector, although the Balanced Scorecard is likely to be an effective option and (4) five leading measures - Quality of Service; Finance; Stakeholders (Customers and Clients); People and Culture; and Governance and Business Management; could be used to determine organisational performance in these sectors. Finally, Mission and Purpose' could be explored as a potential measure. Further research to understand why there is such limited published organisational performance evidence for the sector could be useful. Case studies of organisational measurement strategies of successful non-acute healthcare charities and research into important factors for organisational performance implementation in the sector may contribute to greater uptake and knowledge dissemination.

AB As globalization increases the interconnectedness between nations, economies, and industries, the introduction of diseases will continue to remain a prominent threat to the livestock sector and the trade of animals and animal products, as well as the livelihoods of farmers, food security and public health. The global pig sector, with its size and dichotomy between production type and biosecurity level, is particularly vulnerable to the transmission of transboundary animal diseases such as African and classical swine fever, foot and mouth disease, or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome. All of the above pose a constant threat to swine health, mainly as a result of both formal and informal international trade.Inspired in the risk assessment methodology, this paper classifies and provides an overview of the different pig disease introduction and exposure pathways, illustrated with abundant examples. Introduction pathways are classified as formal international trade (by product), informal international trade (by product), and spread through fomites. Formal trade of pigs and pork products is regulated by legislation and measures protecting animal populations from exotic diseases. Much more difficult to control is the transboundary swine disease transmission originating through informal trade, which entails illegal smuggling, but also the informal cross-border transfer of animals and products for personal use or within informal market chains. Meat products are most commonly mentioned, although fomites have also played a role in some cases, with live pigs, being more difficult to smuggle playing a role less frequently. The main exposure pathways are also described with the oral route playing a prominent role.Risk assessments can aid in the identification of pathways of pathogen introduction and exposure. However, quantitative information on informal disease introduction pathways remains very scarce and often incomplete, making it difficult to estimate the actual magnitudes of risks. Nevertheless, this knowledge is deemed essential to set up risk based awareness, prevention and surveillance programs that correspond to reality.

AB BackgroundHealth professionals and healthcare volunteers play a critical role in promoting uptake of the fecal occult blood test (FOBT), which is an effective screening method for colorectal cancer. However, previous studies paid less attention to investigating both groups regarding their intention to undergo the test. This study used the Health Belief Model (HBM) to explore the likelihood of an FOBT uptake among health professionals and healthcare volunteers aged 50years or older.MethodsA cross-sectional survey was conducted at public health centers in a county in northern Taiwan. Health professionals and healthcare volunteers were invited to complete the questionnaires. Overall, 391 valid questionnaires were obtained (response rate=93.10%). Structural equation modeling was used to examine the associations among the variables based on the HBM.ResultsThe HBM explained 45, 44, and 50% of the variance in the likelihood of undergoing an FOBT in all participants, health professionals, and healthcare volunteers, respectively. The explained variance in healthcare volunteers outweighed that of professionals by 6%. Perceived benefits and self-efficacy significantly affected the likelihood of undergoing an FOBT. Self-efficacy significantly mediated the effects of perceived severity, benefits, and barriers on the likelihood of an FOBT uptake. A borderline significant difference in structural coefficients was found across groups.ConclusionsThe HBM model was used to examine the likelihood of an FOBT uptake among health professionals and healthcare volunteers, and the results showed that self-efficacy was the optimal predictor of the likelihood of an FOBT uptake, followed by perceived benefits. Future multifactorial interventions to promote FOBT uptake among health professionals and healthcare volunteers aged 50-75years could include these significant factors.

AB BackgroundTaenia solium taeniosis/cysticercosis is a public health and agricultural problem, especially in low-income countries, and has been ranked the top foodborne parasitic hazard globally. In 2012, the World Health Organization published a roadmap that called for a validated strategy for T. solium control and elimination by 2015. This goal has not been met, and validated evidence of effective control or elimination in endemic countries is still incomplete. Measuring and evaluating success of control programmes remains difficult, as locally acceptable targets have not been defined as part of the 2012 roadmap nor from other sources, and the performance of tools to measure effect are limited.DiscussionWe believe that an international agreement supported by the tripartite World Health Organization, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and World Organisation for Animal Health is needed to facilitate endemic countries in publicising SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable/attainable, Relevant, Time-bound) country-level control target goals. These goals should be achievable through locally acceptable adoption of options from within a standardised intervention tool-kit', and progress towards these goals should be monitored using standardised and consistent diagnostics. Several intervention tools are available which can contribute to control of T. solium, but the combination of these - the most effective control algorithm - still needs to be identified. In order to mount control efforts and ensure political commitment, stakeholder engagement and funding, we argue that a stepwise approach, as developed for Rabies control, is necessary if control efforts are to be successful and sustainable.ConclusionsThe stepwise approach can provide the framework for the development of realistic control goals of endemic areas, the implementation of intervention algorithms, and the standardised monitoring of the evaluation of the progress towards obtaining the control target goals and eventually elimination.

AB BackgroundSustainable Development Goals set a challenge for the elimination of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection as a public health concern by the year 2030. Deployment of a robust prophylactic vaccine and enhanced interventions for prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) are cornerstones of elimination strategy. However, in light of the estimated global burden of 290 million cases, enhanced efforts are required to underpin optimisation of public health strategy. Robust analysis of population epidemiology is particularly crucial for populations in Africa made vulnerable by HIV co-infection, poverty, stigma and poor access to prevention, diagnosis and treatment.MethodsWe here set out to evaluate the current and future role of HBV vaccination and PMTCT as tools for elimination. We first investigated the current impact of paediatric vaccination in a cohort of children with and without HIV infection in Kimberley, South Africa. Second, we used these data to inform a new parsimonious model to simulate the ongoing impact of preventive interventions. By applying these two approaches in parallel, we are able to determine both the current impact of interventions, and the future projected outcome of ongoing preventive strategies over time.ResultsExisting efforts have been successful in reducing paediatric prevalence of HBV infection in this setting to <1%, demonstrating the success of the existing vaccine campaign. Our model predicts that, if consistently deployed, combination efforts of vaccination and PMTCT can significantly reduce population prevalence (HBsAg) by 2030, such that a major public health impact is possible even without achieving elimination. However, the prevalence of HBV e-antigen (HBeAg)-positive carriers will decline more slowly, representing a persistent population reservoir. We show that HIV co-infection significantly reduces titres of vaccine-mediated antibody, but has a relatively minor role in influencing the projected time to elimination. Our model can also be applied to other settings in order to predict impact and time to elimination based on specific interventions.ConclusionsThrough extensive deployment of preventive strategies for HBV, significant positive public health impact is possible, although time to HBV elimination as a public health concern is likely to be substantially longer than that proposed by current goals.

AB BackgroundWe used data released by the government to analyze the epidemiological distribution of pulmonary tuberculosis in mainland China from 2004 to 2015, in order to provide a deeper understanding of trends in the epidemiology of pulmonary tuberculosis in China and a theoretical basis to assess the effectiveness of government interventions and develop more targeted prevention and control strategies.MethodsA discrete dynamic model was designed based on the epidemiological characteristics of pulmonary tuberculosis and fitted to data published by the government to estimate changes in indicators such as adequate contact rate, prevalence of non-treated pulmonary tuberculosis (abbreviated as prevalence), and infection rate. Finally, we performed sensitivity analyses of the effects of parameters on the population infection rate.ResultsThe epidemiological features of pulmonary tuberculosis in China include a pattern of seasonal fluctuations, with the highest rates of infection in autumn and winter. The adequate contact rate has increased slightly from an average of 0.12/month in 2010 to an average of 0.21/month in 2015. The prevalence in the population has continued to decrease from 3.4% in early 2004 to 1.7% in late 2015. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) infection rate in the population decreased gradually from 42.3% at the beginning of 2004 to 36.7% at the end of 2015. The actual number of new infections gradually decreased from 1,300,000/year in 2010 to 1,100,000/year in 2015. The actual number of new patients each year has been relatively stable since 2010 and remains at approximately 2,600,000/year.ConclusionsThe population prevalence and the M. tuberculosis infection rate have decreased year by year since 2004, indicating that the tuberculosis epidemic in China has been effectively controlled. However, pulmonary tuberculosis has become increasingly contagious since 2010. China should focus on the prevention and control of pulmonary tuberculosis during autumn and winter.

AB BackgroundThe prevalence of child malnutrition in Angola is still very high, and little is known about its associated factors. The aim of this study was to identify these factors in children under 2years in a suburban area of the country's capital city.MethodsWe used data from a cross-sectional population-based study conducted in 2010. The outcomes studied were stunting and underweight. Multivariable analysis was conducted; prevalence ratios were estimated by Poisson regression with robust variance using a hierarchical model.ResultsOf the children studied (N=749), 232 [32.0% (95% CI: 28.7-35.5%)] were stunted and 109 [15.1% (95% CI: 12.6-17.9%)] were underweight. In multivariable analysis, occurrence of diarrhea (PR 1.39 [95% CI: 1.07-1.87]) and the death of other children in the household (PR 1.52 [95% CI: 1.01-2,29]) were associated with stunting and underweight, respectively. In the model composed only of distal and intermediate factors, the primary caregiver not being the mother increased the prevalence of stunting by 42% (PR 1.42 [95% CI: 1.10-1.84], and a mother's working outside the house while not being self-employed was associated with its reduced prevalence (PR 0.55 [95% CI: 0.34-0.89]). In the intermediate model, each additional month of delay in the onset of prenatal care increased the relative prevalence of underweight by 20% (PR 1.20 [95% CI: 1.03-1.40]).ConclusionsDespite the high prevalence rates of stunting and underweight, relatively few risk factors were identified for these conditions, suggesting that collective exposures are likely to play a major role in causing malnutrition in Angola. The individual factors identified can be useful for the development of strategies to deal with this public health problem.

AB BackgroundDigital media are increasingly abundant and used to seek health information, however, to date very little is known on parents' seeking behavior in the context of child's health and development outside English-speaking and Scandinavian countries. By investigating the prevalence of, and reasons for use, we studied parents' perception of the Internet as a resource for improving their health-related knowledge.MethodsThe survey was conducted in a random sample of 2573 Swiss-German parents with at least one child aged less-than 2years old. Parents received a mailed invitation to fill in an online questionnaire. Two reminders were sent, the later with a paper questionnaire attached. The questionnaire included questions on use of print, digital, and personal information sources, as well as different information situations: general health and development or illness. We ran descriptive analyses on information seeking behavior, type of digital media used, reasons of use. We also conducted regression analyses to explore factors associated with parental perceptions with regard to the Internet's utility as a source for health information.ResultsA total of 769 questionnaires were returned (response rate 30%). Nearly all parents (91%) used digital media for seeking information on their child's health and development, and the main reason for use was indicated as being the 24/7 availability of information. Search engines (55%) and webpages for parents (47%) were by far the most frequently used digital media. Generally, the internet is perceived as a good resource, especially by fathers (OR=1.80, 95% CI: 1.03-3.16). However, a large percentage of parents are skeptical about the correctness of online info (91%), are unsure about their interpretive understanding, and ask for guidance from their pediatrician (67%).ConclusionsThe Internet has become a highly frequented source of information for Swiss-German parents on children's health with largely valuable perceptions of its utility. Digital media are used in addition to and not in replacement of print media and personal contacts. Increasing parental guidance by health and public health professionals could improve parental digital health utilization and empower parents in the new role they adopt.

AB BackgroundThe government of Mongolia mandates free access to primary healthcare (PHC) for its citizens. However, no evidence is available on the physical presence of PHC services within health facilities. Thus, the present study assessed the capacity of health facilities to provide basic services, at minimum standards, using a World Health Organization (WHO) standardized assessment tool.MethodsThe service availability and readiness assessment (SARA) tool was used, which comprised a set of indicators for defining whether a health facility meets the required conditions for providing basic or specific services. The study examined all 146 health facilities in Chingeltei and Khan-Uul districts of Ulaanbaatar city, including private and public hospitals, family health centers (FHCs), outpatient clinics, and sanatoriums. The assessment questionnaire was modified to the country context, and data were collected through interviews and direct observations. Data were analyzed using SPSS 21.0, and relevant nonparametric tests were used to compare median parameters.ResultsA general service readiness index, or the capacity of health facilities to provide basic services at minimum standards, was 44.1% overall and 36.3, 61.5, and 62.4% for private clinics, FHCs, and hospitals, respectively. Major deficiencies were found in diagnostic capacity, supply of essential medicines, and availability of basic equipment; the mean scores for general service readiness was 13.9, 14.5 and 47.2%, respectively. Availability of selected PHC services was 19.8%. FHCs were evaluated as best capable (69.5%) to provide PHC among all health facilities reviewed (p<0.001). Contribution of private clinics and sanatoriums to PHC service provisions were minimal (4.1 and 0.5%, respectively). Service-specific readiness among FHCs for family planning services was 44.0%, routine immunization was 83.6%, antenatal care was 56.5%, preventive and curative care for children was 44.5%, adolescent health services was 74.2%, tuberculosis services was 53.4%, HIV and STI services was 52.2%, and non-communicable disease services was 51.7%.ConclusionsUniversal access to PHC is stipulated throughout various policies in Mongolia; however, the present results revealed that availability of PHC services within health facilities is very low. FHCs contribute most to providing PHC, but readiness is mostly hampered by a lack of diagnostic capacity and essential medicines.

AB BackgroundThe aim of the Hellenic National Nutrition and Health Survey was to assess nutritional intake, health status and various behaviors in a representative sample of the Greek population.MethodsData collection took place from 01.09.2013 to 31.05.2015. Random stratified sampling was performed by (a) geographical density criteria of Greece (7 regions), (b) age group of the reference population (<19, 20-64 and >65years) and (c) gender distribution. The final population enrolled included (throughout Greece), 4574 individuals (42.5% men; 57.5% women of who 47.2% were from Athens metropolitan area, 18.5% from Central Macedonia, and the remaining 34% almost equally scattered throughout the country (p for the comparisons with official statistics by region, age group and sex >0.7). Questionnaires developed were based on extensive review of the literature, following a validation procedure when necessary.ResultsPreliminary analyses revealed that 32% of the adult population were overweight and 15.5% were obese, with significant gender differences in total and per age group (p<0.001, for all). The majority of the adult population reported being active smokers (50.4%) or regular alcohol consumers (72.4%); with significant gender differences (p<0.001, for all). Prevalence of hyperlipidemia was 16.7%, cardiovascular disease 13.9%, hypertension 13.3%, thyroid disease 13.8%, and Diabetes Mellitus 3.6%. Significant gender and age group differences were found in various diseases.ConclusionsStudy's preliminary results provide valuable information about the Hellenic population's health. Findings from this survey could be used to detect disease risk factors for public health prevention policies and programs.

AB BackgroundInformation about effects of treatments based on unsystematic reviews of research evidence may be misleading. However, finding trustworthy information about the effects of treatments based on systematic reviews, which is accessible to patients and the public can be difficult. The objectives of this study were to identify and evaluate free sources of health information for patients and the public that provide information about effects of treatments based on systematic reviews.MethodsWe reviewed websites that we and our colleagues knew of, searched for government sponsored health information websites, and searched for online sources of health information that provide evidence-based information. To be included in our review, a website had to be available in English, freely accessible, and intended for patients and the public. In addition, it had to have a broad scope, not limited to specific conditions or types of treatments. It had to include a description of how the information is prepared and the description had to include a statement about using systematic reviews. We compared the included websites by searching for information about the effects of eight treatments.ResultsThree websites met our inclusion criteria: Cochrane Evidence, Informed Health, and PubMed Health. The first two websites produce content, whereas PubMed Health aggregated content. A fourth website that met our inclusion criteria, CureFacts, was under development. Cochrane Evidence provides plain language summaries of Cochrane Reviews (i.e. summaries that are intended for patients and the public). They are translated to several other languages. No information besides treatment effects is provided. Informed Health provides information about treatment effects together with other information for a wide range of topics. PubMed Health was discontinued in October 2018. It included a large number of systematic reviews of treatment effects with plain language summaries for Cochrane Reviews and some other reviews. None of the three websites included links to ongoing trials, and information about treatment effects was not reported consistently on any of the websites.ConclusionIt is possible for patients and the public to access trustworthy information about the effects of treatments using the two of the websites included in this review.

AB BackgroundFamily caregivers play crucial roles in taking care of people experiencing schizophrenia in the community. The burdens on and needs of caregivers of these patients should be emphasized. This study aimed to explore the perspective of family caregivers of people experiencing schizophrenia in the communities of Beijing in terms of the burdens of care and the acquisition and further need for support in order to provide guidance to health care providers regarding how to target therapeutic interventions for families of individuals experiencing schizophrenia and to provide recommendations for policy makers to tailor countermeasures and services.MethodsA total of 20 family caregivers of schizophrenia patients were enrolled in our study. A face-to-face and semi-structured in-depth qualitative interview study was conducted to explore the caregivers' perspective on the burden on caregivers, support and further needs. This study was conducted in the community health service centres where the family caregivers regularly visit. The study was carried out according to good ethical practices, data analysis and reporting guidelines.ResultsMost participants reported that they were suffering from heavy life burdens and had negative experiences with respect to obtaining social support, and they emphasized that they would require more support. Economic and daily housework burdens, limited social communication, and psychological stresses were the principal burdens. Support including financial, medical and information and educational support did not satisfy the needs of the caregivers and their patients. More financial support, respect, and rehabilitation institutions were reported to be needs of the caregivers.ConclusionsFamily caregivers of people experiencing schizophrenia suffer from heavy physical and psychological burdens; however, the current support provided is insufficient. More services and better public attitudes should be considered for people experiencing schizophrenia and their caregivers.

AB BackgroundAlthough public policy in Brazil supports access to essential medicines, the health system cannot meet all demand. Increasingly, the population has used legal demands to seek access to medicines, an approach that can undermine equitable access by creating policy inconsistencies (e.g., granting access to medicines outside the SUS formulary). In response, the Executive Branch has signed institutional agreements to create an administrative case for submitting requests for medicines directly to the Executive Branch. The objective of this study was to assess the degree to which the administrative cases for requests are in accordance with public policies and guidelines, e.g., if administrative cases results in fewer decisions to purchase outside the SUS formulary.MethodsThis descriptive study used secondary data from lawsuits filed against the Executive Branch from 2003 to 2015 and from administrative cases granted by the Executive Branch from 2010 to 2015 in the capital of a state located in the central-western region of Brazil. The variables included plaintiffs' sociodemographic characteristics and diseases as well as the characteristics of the medical products sought via the processes.ResultsComparing the requests submitted through lawsuits and the administrative cases revealed differences in the incomes of plaintiffs and the costs of medicines. Both methods for submission recorded requests for medicines for diseases of endocrine and circulatory systems; the only difference was the prevalence of diseases of the genitourinary system in the lawsuits. A higher proportion of lawsuits sought medicines outside the SUS formulary with therapeutic alternatives, while medicines outside the SUS formulary without an alternative were more commonly requested in administrative cases.ConclusionAdministrative cases adhere to the public policies and guidelines of the SUS. The administrative cases results in fewer decisions to purchase outside the SUS formulary with alternative, and more decisions to purchase drugs for which there is a formulary alternative. In addition, administrative cases provide greater equity by favoring lower income applicants. However, administrative cases also reveal deficiencies in the State's implementation of existing pharmaceutical policies. The public pressure for effective implementation of existing policies may help expand access to medicines.

AB BackgroundAnemia in children continues to be a major public health challenge in developing countries and particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Anemia has serious consequences on the growth and development of the children in the early stages of life. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of anemia among children from 6 to 59months in Togo.MethodsData from the Togo Demographic and Health Survey 2013-2014 were used for this study. This nationally representative survey provided data on a wide range of indicators such as mother and child health, nutrition and other characteristics. Anemia status was determined using hemoglobin level (Hb <11.0g/dl), and the weighted prevalence of childhood anemia along with 95% confidence intervals were provided. Data were analyzed using logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for associated factors.ResultsTwo thousand eight hundred ninety children aged 6-59months were included in this analysis. The weighted prevalence of anemia was 70.9% [95% CI=68.8-73.1] with 2.6% [95% CI=2.0-3.3] of severe anemia among these children. In the multivariate analysis, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for anemia was 0.33 [95% CI=0.26-0.42] in children aged from 24 to 42months and 0.22 [95% CI=0.17-0.29] in children aged from 43 to 59months. Children's malaria status was strongly associated to childhood anemia with an aOR of 3.03 [95% CI=2.49-3.68]. The secondary level of education and more for the mother was associated to childhood anemia with an aOR of 0.67 [95% CI=0.52-0.86]. The aOR for children whose mother had anemia was 1.62 [95% CI=1.30-2.02].ConclusionThis study has highlighted the high prevalence of childhood anemia in Togo and revealed that younger children and maternal anemia were positively associated to childhood anemia whereas age of children and high level of maternal education were negatively associated to childhood anemia.

AB BackgroundThe incidence of pneumonia in Korea started to increase in the 1990's after a period of decrease and stabilization, and the mortality and hospitalization rates for pneumonia in Korea are alarmingly high. This study was performed to examine geographic variation and factors associated with hospitalization for bacterial pneumonia in Korea.MethodsData were acquired from the inpatient claims of the 2015 period of the National Health Insurance Service. The age- and sex-standardized hospitalization rates for bacterial pneumonia were calculated for three age groups. Geographic variation was measured with the coefficient of variation, the ratio of the 90th to the 10th percentile of the distribution of rates, and the systematic component of variation. Considering the results of Moran's I statistic which suggested spatial autocorrelation, we estimated spatial regression models using spatial error models.ResultsThe hospitalization rate for bacterial pneumonia was 79.1 per 10,000 population, and the rate was the highest in the age group 0-14 at 325.3, and it was 161.5 among the elderly. The geographic variation statistics showed high variation with the coefficient variation at 0.6. The deprivation score showed positive associations, and the number of primary care physicians had a negative association with the hospitalization rates across all age groups but the age group 0-14. The number of beds in hospitals with less than 300 beds had a positive association with the hospitalization rates for bacterial pneumonia, and the impact was the strongest in the age group 0-14.ConclusionsThe present study shows that pneumonia can be a major public health issue even in a developed country. Socioeconomic conditions can still be a concern for pneumonia in developed countries, and the role of primary care physicians in preventing hospitalization for bacterial pneumonia needs to be recognized. Most of all, the strong impact of hospital beds on the hospitalization rates for pneumonia, especially for the children, should be addressed. High disease burden of pneumonia in Korea can partly be attributable to oversupply of hospital beds. These factors should be taken into consideration in establishing policy measures for the rise in pneumonia.

TI Cost of illness and program of dengue: A systematic review
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Review
ID ECONOMIC COST; BURDEN; HEALTH; COLOMBIA; AMERICA; IMPACT; BRAZIL
AB Background
   Studies on dengue related to the cost of illness and cost of the program are factors to describe the economic burden of dengue, a neglected disease that has global importance in public health. These studies are often used by health managers in optimizing financial resources. A systematic review of studies estimating the cost of dengue was carried out, comparing the costs between the studies and examining the cost drivers regarding the methodological choices.
   Methods
   This study was done according to the guidelines of the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD). Several databases were searched: Medline, Virtual Health Library and CRD. Two researchers, working independently, selected the studies and extracted the data. The quality of the methodology of the individual studies was achieved by a checklist of 29 items based on protocols proposed by the British Medical Journal and Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards. A qualitative and quantitative narrative synthesis was performed.
   Results
   A literature search yielded 665 publications. Of these, 22 studies are in accordance with previously established inclusion criteria. The cost estimates were compared amongst the studies, highlighting the study design, included population and comparators used (study methodology). The component costs included in the economic evaluation were based on direct and indirect costs, wherein twelve studies included both costs, twelve studies adopted the societal perspective and ten studies used the perspective of the public health service provider, or of a private budget holder.
   Conclusion
   This study showed that the cost of dengue in 18 countries generated approximately US$ 3.3 billion Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) in 2015. This confirms that the burden of dengue has a great economic impact on countries with common socioeconomic characteristics and similarities in health systems, particularly developing countries, indicating a need for further studies in these countries.

TI Towards a universal concept of vulnerability: Broadening the evidence
   from the elderly to perinatal health using a Delphi approach
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CARE; DISPARITIES
AB Background
   The concept 'vulnerability' is prevalent in the public domain, health care, social institutions and multidisciplinary research. Conceptual heterogeneity is present, hampering the creation of a common evidence-base of research achievements and successful policies. Recently an international expert group combined a specific literature review with a 2-stage Delphi procedure, arriving at a seemingly universal concept of vulnerability for the elderly with applications for research instruments. We replicated and extended this study, to generalize this result to health in general, and perinatal health in particular.
   Methods
   Two independent expert panels (general health, perinatal health) repeated the Delphi-procedure, using an extended and updated literature review to derive statements on the concept and defining pathways of vulnerability. Additional views were collected on research tools. Consensus-by-design was explicitly avoided. Data collection and processing was independent.
   Results
   Both panels showed surprising convergence on the pathways of vulnerability to health/ill-health, and their interaction. The agreed conceptual model describes a dynamic relation between health and ill-health and vulnerability. The 2 key pathways that link to vulnerability, are complementary, but not symmetrical as biological processes of maintaining health or obtaining better health are not reciprocal to recovery, so also not in terms of vulnerability impacts. An individual's degree of vulnerability is the net balance of risk effects and protective and healing factors (socially, biologically and in terms of health literacy and health care access). These factors can for measurement purposes (according to the panels: interview for exploration, checklists for population research) be grouped into 'material resources', 'taking responsibility for one's own health', 'risky activities and behaviors', and 'social support'. Supportive and transforming action can thus be undertaken.
   Conclusion
   A universal concept of vulnerability in the context of health was successfully derived after careful replication and extension of an international Delphi study on vulnerability among the elderly.

AB Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), the most common chronic complication of diabetes, has become an important public health crisis worldwide. Given that DPN is extremely difficult to treat, determining its risk factors and controlling it at an early stage is critical to preventing its serious consequences and the burden of social disease. Current studies suggest that the risk factors for diabetic peripheral neuropathy are the duration of diabetes, age, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), diabetic retinopathy (DR), smoking, and body mass Index (BMI). However, most of the aforementioned studies are cross-sectional, and the sample sizes are very limited, so the strength of causal reasoning is relatively low. The current study systematically evaluated DPN's influencing factors in patients with type 2 diabetes using evidence-based medicine. Overall, 16 included studies (14 cross-sectional studies and 2 case-control studies including 12,116 cases) that conformed to the present criteria were included in the final analysis. The results suggested that the duration of diabetes (MD 2.5, 95% CI 1.71 similar to 3.29), age (MD 4.00, 95% CI 3.05 similar to 4.95), HbA1c (MD 0.48, 95% CI 0.33 similar to 0.64), and DR (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.74 similar to 3.16) are associated with significantly increased risks of DPN among diabetic patients, while BMI, smoking, total triglyceride (TG), and total cholesterol (TC) did not indicate any risks of increasing DPN. The findings provide a scientific basis for a further understanding of the causes of type 2 diabetes complicated with peripheral neuropathy and the improvement of preventive strategies. The next step is to conduct further high-quality prospective cohort studies to validate this paper's findings.

AB The aesthetic appreciation of natural places is one of the most fundamental ways in which people relate to their environment. It provides wellbeing, an opportunity for recreation and reflection, a sense of place, and cultural enrichment. It also motivates people to take care of natural places and to conserve them for current and future appreciation. Aesthetically valuable places also support significant economic activity. However, there is little guidance available to assist environmental managers and policy-makers to consider and integrate aesthetic values into decision-making processes. In this study, we present an approach for developing robust and practical indicators of aesthetic value to enable environmental managers to consider, assess and report on aesthetic condition and trend. We demonstrate its utility using the case of the Great Barrier Reef, a region currently undergoing significant social, economic and environmental change and an area formally protected, in part, for its aesthetic values. A qualitative scoping study with 30 key informants identified over 180 potential qualities contributing to reef aesthetics. We tested five for their utility in capturing key aspects of the coral reef aesthetic: (i) coral cover, (ii) coral pattern, (iii) coral topography, (iv) fish abundance, and (v) visibility. We asked 1,417 online Australians to aesthetically rate 50 out of 181 underwater coral reef images that varied in relation to these five attributes. Coral topography, fish abundance, and visibility were significantly correlated with aesthetic ratings, whilst coral cover and coral pattern were not. We also tested for demographic patterns in aesthetic ratings. Our pilot study has demonstrated that readily measurable characteristics of coral reefs can provide useful indicators of aesthetic quality, opening up opportunities for coral reef managers and policymakers to assess and track changes in aesthetics in ways that are relevant to the public. There is considerable scope to further advance capacity for monitoring and managing aesthetic values of coral reefs through additional research that resolves nuances in the meanings associated with aesthetics in coral reef settings.

ID INJURIES; NUMBER
AB Road Traffic Accidents (RTA) are a major worldwide public health problem. The aim of this study was to use the growth mixture model for clustering countries on the basis of the mortality rate patterns of RTAs from 2007 to 2013. We obtained the data on RTA death rates from World Health Organization reports and Human Development Index (HDI) of United Nations Development Programme reports for the years 2007, 2010 and 2013. Simple Latent Growth Models (LGM) in 181 countries were applied to estimate overall RTA mortality rate growth trajectories and the latent growth mixture modeling utilized to cluster them. According to non-linear LGM, the overall mortality rate of RTAs showed a decrease from 2007 to 2010 followed by an increase from 2010 to 2013. The HDI covariate had a significant negative and positive effect on intercept and slope of the LGM, respectively. The extracted mixture model appeared to have seven classes with different trends in RTA mortality rates. The worldwide countries were clustered into seven classes. Further studies on each of the seven classes are suggested to provide recommendations for reducing the mortality rate of the RTAs. Additionally, increasing HDI in some countries could have a significant effect on reducing the RTA death rates.

AB BackgroundReduced mobility is the first sign of functional decline and can lead to dependency in elderly people. Screening for the risk of mobility limitation in this population is an important public health issue to prevent further disabilities. Despite the current lack of guidelines, primary care healthcare providers may have a central role to play in this type of screening. Multi-domain physical exercise interventions in older persons have shown some efficacy/effectiveness on frailty status, yet, to the best of our knowledge, no published study has focused on patients screened in primary care.MethodThe PRISME-3P study is a national, interventional, multicenter, cluster randomized trial. Patients over 70years of age will be systematically screened by their general practitioner (GP) on the basis of clinical criteria of mobility limitation. To avoid contamination bias, the unit of randomization will be the GP practice. In the intervention group, patients will consult a geriatrician and a dietician, and will receive a physical training program from a personal trainer who will demonstrate the exercises and provide follow-up coaching. The control group will receive standard care. The primary outcome will be the change in Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) scores between inclusion and 6-months follow-up.DiscussionWe expect an improvement of the SPPB between inclusion and 6months of follow-up.Trial registrationThis study is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02847871, 27 July 2016).

AB BackgroundPatient and public involvement (PPI) in health educationis a practice whereby research and education are carried in collaboration with' patients and/or citizens, maintaining their role as a team member or expert. PPI in health education is of great interest for all stakeholders in the field, as it can make program development more relevant to the public and increase its utilization by the target population. However, little is known about how PPI should be implemented in different settings particularly in rural and remote areas. Therefore, a deeper understanding of how PPI works in different environments is needed. We aim to explore how information and communication technologies (ICT) are used for PPI in health education programs in rural and remote areas.MethodsWe performed a scoping review. Two reviewers independently selected 641 studies from five electronic databases. Data were extracted, charted and validated by the senior researcher and study lead. We performed a narrative synthesis to map the literature.ResultsOf the initial 641 articles identified, 5 fit the eligibility criteria. Most of the studies targeted community members at large. Consultation and collaboration were the main levels of PPI, which included communities at large and specific at-risk groups. The main forms of ICT used were telephone and Internet, followed by teleconferences, electronic health records, and weblogs. No study measured the effectiveness of ICT for involving patients in health education in rural and remote areas.ConclusionTelephone and Internet were the most frequently used forms of PPI in health education in rural areas with consultation and collaboration as the main levels of PPI there. No study measured the impact of ICT for PPI in health education in rural areas. Due to this, measuring the impact of ICT in rural and remote areas as a means for PPI in health education of medical students, health professionals and patients requires further study.

AB BackgroundThe emergence of norovirus genotype GII.4 variants has been associated with gastroenteritis pandemics worldwide, prompting molecular surveillance for early detection of novel strains. In this study, we aimed to analyze the outbreak activity of norovirus and characterize the norovirus strains circulating in Alberta between July 2012 and February 2018.MethodsStool samples from gastroenteritis outbreaks in Alberta were tested for norovirus at the Provincial Laboratory for Public Health using a multiplex real time-RT PCR assay. The ORF1 and ORF2-genotypes of norovirus positive samples were assigned based on phylogenetic analyses of partial polymerase and capsid sequences, respectively.ResultsA total of 530 norovirus outbreaks were identified. During July 2012 and June 2017 there was a gradual decrease in the annual number of GII.4 outbreaks, however, outbreak numbers increased from June 2017-February 2018. Four novel strains emerged: GII.17 Kawasaki in July 2014-June 2015, GII.P16/GII.4 Sydney in July 2015-June 2016, GII.P16/GII.2 and GII.P4 New Orleans/GII.4 Sydney in July 2016-June 2017. GII.Pe/GII.4 Sydney was the single predominant strain responsible for the majority (over 50%) of all norovirus outbreaks up to June 2015. Between June 2017 and February 2018, GII.P16/GII.4 Sydney was the leading strain causing 63% of all norovirus outbreaks.ConclusionsGII.4 stands as the predominant capsid genotype causing a large majority of the norovirus outbreaks in early 2018. An increase in genotype diversity was observed in the last years, characterized by a high circulation of non-GII.4 strains and GII.4 recombinants.

AB BackgroundRecently, euthanasia and assisted suicide (EAS) in patients with psychiatric disorders, dementia, or an accumulation of health problems has taken a prominent place in the public debate. However, limited is known about this practice. The purpose of this study was threefold: to estimate the frequency of requesting and receiving EAS among people with (also) a psychiatric disorder, dementia, or an accumulation of health problems; to explore reasons for physicians to grant or refuse a request; and to describe differences in characteristics, including the presence of psychiatric disorders, dementia, and accumulation of health problems, between patients who did and did not request EAS and between patients whose request was or was not granted.MethodsA nationwide cross-sectional survey study was performed. A stratified sample of death certificates of patients who died between 1 August and 1 December 2015 was drawn from the central death registry of Statistics Netherlands. Questionnaires were sent to the certifying physician (n=9351, response 78%). Only deceased patients aged 17years and who died a non-sudden death were included in the analyses (n=5361).ResultsThe frequency of euthanasia requests among deceased people who died non-suddenly and with (also) a psychiatric disorder (11.4%), dementia (2.1%), or an accumulation of health problems (8.0%) varied. Factors positively associated with requesting euthanasia were age (<80years), ethnicity (Dutch/Western), cause of death (cancer), attending physician (general practitioner), and involvement of a pain specialist or psychiatrist. Cause of death (neurological disorders, another cause) and attending physician (general practitioner) were also positively associated with receiving euthanasia. Psychiatric disorders, dementia, and/or an accumulation of health problems were negatively associated with both requesting and receiving euthanasia.ConclusionsEAS in deceased patients with psychiatric disorders, dementia, and/or an accumulation of health problems is relatively rare. Partly, this can be explained by the belief that the due care criteria cannot be met. Another explanation is that patients with these conditions are less likely to request EAS.

AB BackgroundRecovery from functionally disabled status is an important target of public health measures for older adults. This study aimed to examine socioeconomic inequalities in the improvement of functional ability among older adults stratified by the level of disability at baseline.MethodsIn the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study, we conducted a mail survey of community-dwelling older adults (1937 men and 2212 women) who developed functional impairment during 2010-2014. The survey data were individually linked to the longitudinal records of changes in the levels of functional disability based on the Public Long-Term Care Insurance System.ResultsThe mean (standard deviation) follow-up period was 316 (269) days. During follow-up, 811 participants (19.5%) showed improved functional ability. Among those with severe disabilities at baseline, men with 13 or more years of education were more likely to improve functional ability than men with 9 or fewer years of education (hazard ratio: 1.97, 95% confidence interval: 1.12-3.45). A similar association was observed among women (hazard ratio: 2.16, 95% confidence interval: 1.03-4.53). Neither income nor occupation was statistically associated with improved functional ability.ConclusionsThere are education-related inequalities in the improvement of functional ability, especially among older adults with severe disabilities. Health policy makers and practitioners should consider the educational background of individuals with reduced functionality in formulating strategies to improve their functional ability.

AB Objective
   The rapid proliferation of machine learning research using electronic health records to classify healthcare outcomes offers an opportunity to address the pressing public health problem of adolescent suicidal behavior. We describe the development and evaluation of a machine learning algorithm using natural language processing of electronic health records to identify suicidal behavior among psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents.
   Methods
   Adolescents hospitalized on a psychiatric inpatient unit in a community health system in the northeastern United States were surveyed for history of suicide attempt in the past 12 months. A total of 73 respondents had electronic health records available prior to the index psychiatric admission. Unstructured clinical notes were downloaded from the year preceding the index inpatient admission. Natural language processing identified phrases from the notes associated with the suicide attempt outcome. We enriched this group of phrases with a clinically focused list of terms representing known risk and protective factors for suicide attempt in adolescents. We then applied the random forest machine learning algorithm to develop a classification model. The model performance was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy.
   Results
   The final model had a sensitivity of 0.83, specificity of 0.22, AUC of 0.68, a PPV of 0.42, NPV of 0.67, and an accuracy of 0.47. The terms mostly highly associated with suicide attempt clustered around terms related to suicide, family members, psychiatric disorders, and psychotropic medications.
   Conclusion
   This analysis demonstrates modest success of a natural language processing and machine learning approach to identifying suicide attempt among a small sample of hospitalized adolescents in a psychiatric setting.

TI Detection of municipalities at-risk of Lyme disease using passive
   surveillance of Ixodes scapularis as an early signal: A
   province-specific indicator in Canada

AB Lyme disease, the most commonly reported vector-borne disease in North America, is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, which is transmitted by Ixodes scapularis in eastern Canada and Ixodes pacificus in western Canada. Recently, the northward range expansion of I. scapularis ticks, in south-eastern Canada, has resulted in a dramatic increase in the incidence of human Lyme disease. Detecting emerging areas of Lyme disease risk allows public health to target disease prevention efforts. We analysed passive tick surveillance data from Ontario and Manitoba to i) assess the relationship between the total numbers of I. scapularis submissions in passive surveillance from humans, and the number of human Lyme disease cases, and ii) develop province-specific acarological indicators of risk that can be used to generate surveillance-based risk maps. We also assessed associations between numbers of nymphal I. scapularis tick submissions only and Lyme disease case incidence. Using General Estimating Equation regression, the relationship between I. scapularis submissions (total numbers and numbers of nymphs only) in each census sub-division (CSD) and the number of reported Lyme disease cases was positively correlated and highly significant in the two provinces (P <= 0.001). The numbers of I. scapularis submissions over five years discriminated CSDs with >= 3 Lyme disease cases from those with < 3 cases with high accuracy when using total numbers of tick submission (Receiver Operating Characteristics area under the curve [AUC] = 0.89) and moderate accuracy (AUC = 0.78) when using nymphal tick submissions only. In Ontario the optimal cut-off point was a total 12 tick submissions from a CSD over five years (Sensitivity = 0.82, Specificity = 0.84), while in Manitoba the cut-off point was five ticks (Sensitivity = 0.71, Specificity = 0.79) suggesting regional variability of the risk of acquiring Lyme disease from an I. scapularis bite. The performances of the acarological indicators developed in this study for Ontario and Manitoba support the ability of passive tick surveillance to provide an early signal of the existence Lyme disease risk areas in regions where ticks and the pathogens they transmit are expanding their range.

TI Children's exposure to physical abuse from a child perspective: A
   population-based study in rural Bangladesh
SO PLOS ONE

AB Background
   Although child physical abuse (CPA) is considered as a major global public health problem, it has not yet been recognized as such in Bangladesh. Very few studies have assessed the prevalence and victims' characteristics of multiple forms of CPA.
   Objective
   This population-based study assessed the prevalence of CPA committed by adults in a rural area of Bangladesh and examined its association with demographic and socio-contextual factors.
   Methods
   Data were obtained using ISPCAN Child Abuse Screening Tool for Children (ICAST-C) in a random sample of 1416 children (49% girls, 51% boys) aged 11 to 17 years by face-to-face interviews during March-April 2017. The response rate was 91.5%. To estimate predictors of CPA, physical abuse was categorized into frequent and less frequent groups.
   Results
   The prevalence of at least one form (>= 1), two forms (>= 2) and three or more forms (>= 3) of CPA were estimated approximately to 99%, 95% and 83% in their lifetime and 93%, 79%, and 57% in the past year respectively. Hitting (except on buttocks), standing/kneeling and slapping were the most common physical abuse whereas given drugs or alcohol, pinched, burned or scalded, beaten-up and locked up were less reported. Female children were faced severe forms of CPA more than that of males. Male children, younger age groups, witnessing adults using weapons at home, bullied by siblings and low level of maternal education were found to be significant risk factors for both >= 1 form and >= 2 forms of frequent CPA whereas adding also adult shouting in a frightening way was found as a significant risk factor for >= 2 forms of frequent CPA.
   Conclusion
   Self-reported prevalence of CPA is extremely common in the Bangladeshi rural society. The prevalence was associated with demographic and socio-contextual characteristics of the children such as being younger, witnessing domestic violence and maternal low education. The findings provide evidence to support parents and policy-makers to take effective measures to implement policy and programme on alternative up-bringing methods and creating awareness of negative effects of CM which in turn help Bangladesh to line up with UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which the country signed in 1990.

AB Introduction
   Hypertension is a common cardiovascular disease at present. Uncontrolled blood pressure leads to further complications including heart attack, stroke and chronic kidney disease. In Thailand, most of the information related to this issue is collected by hospitals or hospital-based organizations rather than at the community level. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension and to assess the relationship between patient characteristics (socio-behavioral and clinical) and uncontrolled blood pressure among hypertensive patients in the rural communities in the central areas in Thailand.
   Materials and methods
   This was a cross-sectional study conducted in Na-Yao and Phra-Pleong rural communities of Thailand in 2018 using the total design method. In all, 406 individuals aged >= 18 years were interviewed using structured questionnaires related to demographic information, higher risk behavior, comorbidities and arthrometric measurement. Blood pressure was assessed for all participants. Uncontrolled hypertension was defined as BP >= 140/90 mmHg.
   Results
   The prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension was 54.4% (males: 59.8%; females: 52.4%). Uncontrolled blood pressure was associated with neck circumference more than 35.75 cm for males and 32.75 cm. for females (adjusted odds ratio; 1.66, 95% confidence interval; 1.03-2.68), sedentary behavior more than 5 hours a day (adjusted odds ratio; 2.03, 95% confidence interval; 1.28-3.23) and missed doctor appointments (adjusted odds ratio; 3.29, 95% confidence interval; 1.09-9.94).
   Conclusion
   Approximately one half of hypertensive patients in these rural communities had uncontrolled blood pressure. The Ministry of Public Health and health care providers should provide further strategies to prevent uncontrolled blood pressure's complications.

TI Seroprevalence of Q fever among high-risk occupations in the Ilam
   province, the west of Iran

AB Background
   Q fever is a zoonotic disease of great public health importance in Iran. This disease is presented with high phase I antibody development in chronic and high phase II antibody in the acute form of illness. This study was conducted to evaluate the seroprevalence of Q fever among high-risk occupations in the Ilam province in Western Iran.
   Methods and findings
   In this cross-sectional study, 367 sera samples were collected from five groups comprised of animal husbandry workers, farmers, butchers, slaughterhouse workers, and park rangers. The collected sera were tested for IgG antibodies against Coxiella burnetii using ELISA. The seroprevalence of antibodies against C. burnetii in phase I and II was 24.38% and 26.37%, respectively (i.e., 32.42% overall). Low educational level, living in rural areas, keeping sheep/goats, ages older than 50 years, and a history of arthropod bites positively correlated with increased risk of Q fever infection. Animal husbandry workers (45.13%) were at higher risk of contracting Q fever compared with other occupations in the study (17.11%).
   Conclusions
   High seroprevalence of C. burnetii among high-risk occupations is a serious challenge in the Ilam province. In addition, the high seroprevalence of endemic Q fever in rural and nomadic areas and a higher concentration of occupations who are directly engaged with livestock demonstrate the critical need for preventive medicine education and training in regards to mitigating risk for disease contraction in susceptible groups.

AB The study of host associations of mosquitoes (Diptera, Culicidae) provides valuable information to assist in our understanding of a variety of related issues, from their life-history to the entomological surveillance of pathogens. In this study, we identified and characterized mosquito blood meals from both urban and forested areas in the city of Paranagua, state of Parana, Brazil, by analyzing the amplification of host DNA ingested by mosquitoes under different storage conditions and digestion levels. Host DNA preservation was evaluated in fresh blood meals according to storage duration (30 to 180 days) and temperature (-20 degrees C / -80 degrees C) and, in digested blood, according the degree of digestion classified on the Sella scale. Molecular analysis of blood meals was based on DNA extraction and amplification of a fragment of the mitochondrial COI gene. We determined that, up to 180 days of storage, the evaluated temperatures did not influence the preservation of fresh blood meals DNA, whereas the amplification success was increasingly reduced over the course of the digestion process. The species Anopheles cruzii, Aedes fluviatilis, Aedes scapularis, Psorophora ferox, Culex quinquefasciatus, Culex mollis, and Culex intrincatus, together with specimens representing four subgenera and one genus of Culicidae [Ae. (Ochlerotatus), Cx. (Culex), Cx. (Melanoconion), Cx. (Microculex), and Limatus, respectively] had their blood meals identified. Their diverse host use was evidenced by the identification of 19 species of vertebrate host, namely two amphibians, three mammals and 14 birds. Birds were the most commonly identified host in blood meals. These results not only show the diversity of mosquito hosts, but also underscore the challenges involved in monitoring arboviruses of public health importance, given potential combinations of host use for each mosquito species.

AB BackgroundThe proportion of older people has dramatically increased in recent decades. Moreover, social and demographic trends show a global increase of older people at risk of loneliness and lack of social relationships. The objective of this study was to evaluate the process, the effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness of a planned 22 weekly group sessions called School of Health for Older People to reduce social isolation.MethodsThis is a mixed methods multi-approach evaluation that includes: 1) A qualitative evaluation among coordinators and participants taking part in the intervention, through in depth-interviews and focus groups, respectively. The main topics covered will be positive and negative aspects of the intervention, suggestions for its improvement, opinions on different aspects of the intervention, and perceived benefits; 2) A quantitative quasi-experimental design, comparing a group of individuals taking part in the intervention with another group with similar characteristics not receiving the intervention. Data will be collected at the beginning and at the end of the intervention. Social support will be measured through questions drawn from the Medical Outcomes Study and the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project questionnaires. Psychological morbidity will be measured through Goldberg's General Health Questionnaire, and Health-related Quality of Life will be measured through the EuroQoL questionnaire. Information on visits to the primary care center in the years before and after the intervention will be obtained from the electronic records of the primary care centers; 3) A cost-utility analysis, which will be conducted from a health system (primary care) perspective, including direct costs of the program and the primary care health services used. The effects of the intervention will be measured on quality-adjusted life years.DiscussionThere is an urgent need for studies assessing the effectiveness and the efficiency of potential interventions to reduce social isolation among older persons. The results of this study will help to fill the knowledge gap in this area and might be especially useful for the development of social and public health policies and programs for older people in disadvantaged neighborhoods in urban areas.Trial registrationNCT03142048 retrospectively registered (April 11, 2017).

AB BackgroundCommunity- associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) cause serious infections and rates continue to rise worldwide. Use of geocoded electronic health record (EHR) data to prevent spread of disease is limited in health service research. We demonstrate how geocoded EHR and spatial analyses can be used to identify risks for CA-MRSA in children, which are tied to place-based determinants and would not be uncovered using traditional EHR data analyses.MethodsAn epidemiology study was conducted on children from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2010 who were treated for Staphylococcus aureus infections. A generalized estimated equations (GEE) model was developed and crude and adjusted odds ratios were based on S. aureus risks. We measured the risk of S. aureus as standardized incidence ratios (SIR) calculated within aggregated US 2010 Census tracts called spatially adaptive filters, and then created maps that differentiate the geographic patterns of antibiotic resistant and non-resistant forms of S. aureus.ResultsCA-MRSA rates increased at higher rates compared to non-resistant forms, p=0.01. Children with no or public health insurance had higher odds of CA-MRSA infection. Black children were almost 1.5 times as likely as white children to have CA-MRSA infections (aOR 95% CI 1.44,1.75, p<0.0001); this finding persisted at the block group level (p<0.001) along with household crowding (p<0.001). The youngest category of age (<4years) also had increased risk for CA-MRSA (aOR 1.65, 95%CI 1.48, 1.83, p<0.0001). CA-MRSA encompasses larger areas with higher SIRs compared to non-resistant forms and were found in block groups with higher proportion of blacks (r=0.517, p<0.001), younger age (r=0.137, p<0.001), and crowding (r=0.320, p<0.001).ConclusionsIn the Atlanta MSA, the risk for CA-MRSA is associated with neighborhood-level measures of racial composition, household crowding, and age of children. Neighborhoods which have higher proportion of blacks, household crowding, and children <4years of age are at greatest risk. Understanding spatial relationship at a community level and how it relates to risks for antibiotic resistant infections is important to combat the growing numbers and spread of such infections like CA-MRSA.

AB BackgroundParaquat (PQ) poisoning is a public health problem in many regions of Colombia. This study aimed to estimate the burden of PQ poisoning in the Department of Antioquia, Colombia.MethodsDisability-adjusted life year (DALYs) were calculated as the sum of years of life lost (YLL) and years of life lived with disability (YLD) due to paraquat poisoning in Antioquia; a bootstrapped method with 1000 iterations was used to estimate each statistical parameter using the package DALY calculator in R. For this instance, the annual incidence of paraquat poisoning was obtained from the reported surveillance data according to regional Government.ResultsFrom 2010 to 2016, 3299 DALYs were estimated in the department of Antioquia for PQ intoxication, with a rate of 53.4 DALYs per 100,000 inhabitants. The majority of the DALYs (2852 DALYs) were generated for men ranging from 15 to 44years old.ConclusionThe rate of DALYs reported here is higher than that reported by all chemical poisonings. Better strategies to regulate and restrict the market of this dangerous products are required in Colombia.

AB BackgroundThe health impacts of community design have been studied extensively over the past two decades. In particular, public transportation use is associated with more walking between transit stops and shops, work, home and other destinations. Change in transit access has been linked with physical activity and obesity but seldom to health outcomes and associated costs, especially within a causal framework. Health related fiscal impacts of transit investment should be a key consideration in major transit investment decisions.MethodsThe Rails & Health study is a natural experiment evaluating changes in clinical measures, health care utilization and health care costs among Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW) members following the opening of a new light rail transit (LRT) line in Portland, Oregon. The study is prospectively following 3036 adults exposed to the new LRT line and a similar cohort of 4386 adults who do not live close to the new line. Individual-level outcomes and covariates are extracted from the electronic medical record at KPNW, including member demographics and comorbidities, blood pressure, body mass index, lipids, glycosylated hemoglobin, and health care utilization and costs. In addition, participants are surveyed about additional demographics, travel patterns, physical activity (PA), and perceived neighborhood walkability. In a subsample of the study population, we are collecting direct measures of travel-related behaviorphysical activity (accelerometry), global positioning system (GPS) tracking, and travel diariesto document mechanisms responsible for observed changes in health outcomes and cost. Comprehensive measures of the built environment at baseline and after rail construction are also collected. Statistical analyses will (1) examine the effects of opening a new LRT line on chronic disease indicators, health care utilization, and health care costs and (2) evaluate the degree to which observed effects of the LRT line on health measures and costs are mediated by changes in total and transportation-associated PA.DiscussionThe results of the Rails & Health study will provide urban planners, transportation engineers, health practitioners, developers, and decision makers with critical information needed to document how transit investments impact population health and related costs.

AB BackgroundThe aim of the study was to explore the implementation of school based diet and physical activity interventions with respect to the barriers and facilitators to adoption, implementation and sustainability; supportive actions required for implementation and recommendations to overcome identified barriers. Two interventions rolled out nationally in Ireland were chosen; Food Dudes, a programme to encourage primary school children to consume more fruit and vegetables and Green Schools Travel (GST), an active travel to school programme in primary and secondary schools. Trained school coordinators (teachers) cascade the programmes to other teaching staff.MethodsMultiple case study design using qualitative semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders: primary and secondary school teachers, school coordinators, project coordinators/managers, funders and intermediaries. Fifteen interviews were conducted. Data were coded using a common categorization matrix. Thematic analysis was undertaken using the Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance elements of the RE-AIM implementation framework.ResultsGood working relationships within and across government departments, intermediaries and schools were critical for intervention adoption, successful implementation and sustainability. Organisational and leadership ability of coordinators were essential. Provision of participation incentives acted as motivators to engage children's interest. A deep understanding of the lives of the target children was an important contextual factor. The importance of adaptation without compromising core components in enhancing intervention sustainability emerged. Successful implementation was hindered by: funding insecurity, school timetable constraints, broad rather than specific intervention core components, and lack of agreement on conduct of programme evaluation. Supportive actions for maintenance included ongoing political support, secure funding and pre-existing healthy lifestyle policies.ConclusionsSuccessful implementation and scale up of public health anti-obesity interventions in schools is dependent on good contextual fit, engagement and leadership at multiple levels and secure funding. Recommendations to overcome barriers include: capacity to deliver within an already overcrowded curriculum and clear specification of intervention components within a conceptual framework to facilitate evaluation. Our findings are generalisable across different contexts and are highly relevant to those involved in the development or adaptation, organisation or execution of national public health interventions:policy makers, guidelines developers, and staff involved in local organisation and delivery.

AB BackgroundWith increases in inactive lifestyles and mounting pressure for academic excellence in Chinese younger populations, lack of physical activity and increased prevalence of obesity have become a major public health concern in China. The purpose of this study is to provide updated estimates on the prevalence of meeting moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and screen viewing time guidelines, and overweight and obesity among Chinese school-aged children and adolescents, with a secondary aim examining variations in prevalence by sex, grade groupings, and residential location.MethodsThe study sample came from the 2017 Physical Activity and Fitness in ChinaThe Youth Study, a cross-sectional and national survey of 131,859 students (aged 7 to 19years) from 986 public schools in China. Measures of MVPA, screen viewing time, and age- and sex-specific overweight and obese body mass index were used to calculate national prevalence estimates of Chinese school-aged children and adolescents.ResultsIn 2017, 34.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34.09-34.11%) of children and adolescents met MVPA guidelines and 65.4% (95% CI, 65.39-65.41%) adhered to screen viewing time guidelines. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was 15.1% (95% CI, 15.09-15.11%) and 10.7% (95% CI, 10.69-10.71%), respectively. Prevalence estimates differed by sex (boys, girls), grade grouping (primary schools, junior middle schools, junior high schools), and residential location (rural, urban).ConclusionsThere remains a low prevalence of meeting MVPA guidelines and high prevalence of overweight and obesity in Chinese school-aged children and adolescents. Future efforts should focus on monitoring the trend of these behavioral and health risk factors to inform school policies and programs aimed at increasing physical activity and reducing and preventing obesity in younger populations in China.

AB Excessive iodine intake is a major public health problem in the Saharawi refugee camps in Algeria, where animal milk is an important source of iodine. The purpose of this study was to assess the association between iodine concentrations in locally produced animal milk and in animal drinking water and further to assess the risk of exceeding European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) tolerable upper intake level for iodine (600 mu g/d) among Saharawi women. In 2009 and 2010, 202 milk samples from goats and sheep and 52 milk samples from camel were collected. Iodine in milk was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). In addition, iodine in 56 water samples from the general water system and 54 water samples from wells, was determined by modified Sandell-Kolthoff reaction. Animal milk is generally consumed mixed with water. The median (min, max) iodine intake from goat/sheep milk mixed with water in camps with high iodine content in human drinking water was 284 (57, 2889) mu g/d and 19% of participants exceeded EFSA upper intake level for iodine. The median (min, max) iodine intake from camel milk mixed with water in all camps was 2100 (210, 11100) and 47% of participants exceeded the EFSA upper intake level. The median (min, max) iodine content in goat/sheep milk from camps with moderate and high iodine content in water was 507 (101, 4791) mu g/L and 1612 (487, 9323) mu g/L, respectively (p < 0.001). The iodine content in goat/sheep milk was positively associated with iodine content in animal drinking water (regression coefficient, B 5.71, 95% CI 4.03, 7.39). In conclusion, consumption of camel milk and living in camps with high water iodine content increased the risk of exceeding the EFSA upper intake level for iodine. We suggest that purified water for both human and animal consumption should be provided.

AB BackgroundPublic and patient involvement is a routine element of health services research methods to produce better designed and reported studies. Although co-production is recommended when involving people in research, methods for involving people are usually designed and managed by researchers and there is little evidence about methods to co-produce models for effective public and patient involvement. We report the method used by a group of patient and carer service users to develop and implement a model for involving public members in research.MethodWe recruited people with experience of chronic conditions, as patients and carers, and supported them to develop and implement the involvement model. We collected written records to describe the processes of co-production.ResultsSixteen service users were involved through a series of workshop, meeting and email discussions. They specified principles and operating characteristics of the model which concerned an inclusive culture, adequate resources, accessibility, good communication and clarity of purpose and roles. Components of the model included an on-line Panel of members (n=20), Steering Group meetings, representation and communication system, facilitator, supportive research environment and access to research activities. Over 8 years, members were active in 218 research activities and held 22 Steering Group meetings. The model was named SUCCESS standing for Service Users with Chronic Conditions Encouraging Sensible Solutions.ConclusionWe supported patients and carers to co-produce the SUCCESS model of involvement in research. The model's components, addressing their needs and priorities, led to sustained involvement in research over 8 years. Further work is needed to apply the model in different settings and assess impact of this method of involving people in research.

AB 'Intersectional stigma' is a concept that has emerged to characterize the convergence of multiple stigmatized identities within a person or group, and to address their joint effects on health and wellbeing. While enquiry into the intersections of race, class, and gender serves as the historical and theoretical basis for intersectional stigma, there is little consensus on how best to characterize and analyze intersectional stigma, or on how to design interventions to address this complex phenomenon. The purpose of this paper is to highlight existing intersectional stigma literature, identify gaps in our methods for studying and addressing intersectional stigma, provide examples illustrating promising analytical approaches, and elucidate priorities for future health research.
   Evidence from the existing scientific literature, as well as the examples presented here, suggest that people in diverse settings experience intersecting forms of stigma that influence their mental and physical health and corresponding health behaviors. As different stigmas are often correlated and interrelated, the health impact of intersectional stigma is complex, generating a broad range of vulnerabilities and risks. Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods approaches are required to reduce the significant knowledge gaps that remain in our understanding of intersectional stigma, shared identity, and their effects on health.
   Stigmatized identities, while often analyzed in isolation, do not exist in a vacuum. Intersecting forms of stigma are a common reality, yet they remain poorly understood. The development of instruments and methods to better characterize the mechanisms and effects of intersectional stigma in relation to various health conditions around the globe is vital. Only then will healthcare providers, public health officials, and advocates be able to design health interventions that capitalize on the positive aspects of shared identity, while reducing the burden of stigma.

AB Despite increased antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage, the incidence of HIV infection among women in rural South Africa remains high. While many socio-demographic and behavioral factors have been identified, the effect of female migration intensity on the risk of HIV acquisition before and after ART scale-up has not been evaluated in the country.
   We followed 13,315 female participants aged 15-49 who were HIV-uninfected at baseline and recorded their migration events between 2004 and 2015. Using a Cox proportional hazard model, we estimated the time to HIV acquisition among the women, adjusting for annual migration intensity (high: ae 2 events/year, moderate = 1 event/year, and low = 0 event/year) before and after ART scale-up in 2010.
   1998 (15%) new HIV-infection events were recorded during the observation period. Overall, high migration intensity was associated with an increased HIV acquisition risk among women when compared with low migration intensity (HR = 2.88, 95% CI: 1.56-5.53). Among those with high migration intensity, the risk of HIV acquisition was significantly lower in the post-ART period compared to the pre-ART period, after controlling for key socio-demographic and behavioural covariates (aHR = 0.18, 95% CI 0.04-0.83).
   Women who migrated frequently after ART scale-up had a significantly reduced HIV acquisition risk compared to those before its implementation. While this reduction is encouraging, women who migrate frequently remain at high risk of HIV acquisition. In the era of ART, there remains a critical need for public health interventions to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition in this highly vulnerable population.

AB In low-income countries such as Nepal, indoor air pollution (IAP), generated by the indoor burning of biomass fuels, is the top-fourth risk factor driving overall morbidity and mortality. We present the first assessment of geographic and socio-economic determinants of the markers of IAP (specifically fuel types, cooking practices, and indoor smoking) in a nationally-representative sample of Nepalese households.
   Household level data on 11,040 households, obtained from the 2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey, were analyzed. Binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the use of fuel types, indoor cooking practices, indoor smoking and IAP with respect to socio-economic indicators and geographic location of the household.
   More than 80% of the households had at least one marker of IAP: 66% of the household used unclean fuel, 45% did not have a separate kitchen to cook in, and 43% had indoor smoking. In adjusted binary logistic regression, female and educational attainment of household's head favored cleaner indoor environment, i.e., using clean fuel, cooking in a separate kitchen, not smoking indoors, and subsequently no indoor pollution. In contrast, households belonging to lower wealth quintile and rural areas did not favor a cleaner indoor environment. Households in Province 2, compared to Province 1, were particularly prone to indoor pollution due to unclean fuel use, no separate kitchen to cook in, and smoking indoors. Most of the districts had a high burden of IAP and its markers.
   Fuel choice and clean indoor practices are dependent on household socio-economic status. The geographical disparity in the distribution of markers of IAP calls for public health interventions targeting households that are poor and located in rural areas.

AB Exposure to carbon monoxide (CO), the odorless, colorless gas resulting from incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons, is preventable. Despite the significant risk of morbidity and mortality associated with CO poisoning, there currently exists no active national CO surveillance system in the United States (U.S.). Our study aims to use electronic health record data to describe the epidemiology of CO poisoning in the Veterans Health Administration healthcare population.
   We identified unique inpatient and outpatient encounters coded with International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for CO poisoning and analyzed relevant demographic, laboratory, treatment, and death data from January 2010 through December 2017 for Veterans across all 50 U.S. states and Puerto Rico. Statistical methods used were 95% CI calculations and the two-tailed z test for proportions.
   We identified 5491 unique patients with CO poisoning, of which 1755 (32%) were confirmed/probable and 3736 (68%) were suspected. Unintentional poisoning was most common (72.9%) overall. Age less than 65 years, residence in Midwest U.S. Census region versus South or West, and winter seasonal trend were characteristics associated with confirmed/probable CO poisoning. Twenty-six deaths (1.5%) occurred within 30 days of confirmed/probable CO poisoning and were primarily caused by cardiovascular events (42%) or anoxic encephalopathy (15%).
   Our findings support the use of ICD-coded data for targeted CO poisoning surveillance, however, improvements are needed in ICD coding to reduce the percentage of cases coded with unknown injury intent and/or CO poisoning source. Prevalence of CO poisoning among Veterans is consistent with other U.S. estimates. Since most cases are unintentional, opportunities exist for provider and patient education to reduce risk.

TI Public finances and tobacco taxation with product variety: Theory and
   application to Senegal and Nigeria
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH; TAXES; EXCISE; POLICY
AB This study endeavors to answer two questions: which category of excise taxes is more appropriate for Senegal and Nigeria and which consequences an increase of the tobacco taxes would have on the price, the demand and the tax revenues in each one of the two countries? To answer these questions, we adopt a double approach: first, a theoretical model of taxation with variety; and second, a simulation model to answer the second question. The results of the theoretical model indicate that, in the context of excise taxation, the number of products variety-or that of cigarette brands-directly affects both the degree of market concentration and the marginal effects of specific and ad valorem excise taxes on the price of tobacco. In addition, the comparison of the marginal effects of ad valorem and specific excise taxes depends on the marginal costs of production of different varieties weighted by the tax rates and the number of varieties. Our empirical results first show that the specific excise taxes are more adapted to Senegal while ad valorem excise taxes fit best Nigeria. This result crucially matters for the excise taxes are exclusively of an ad valorem nature in both Senegal and Nigeria. It is perfectly possible to envisage a situation where the two main forms of excise taxes could co-exist. It also appears from our results that tax development does not have the same implications for the two countries. Increasing tobacco taxes in Senegal strongly reduces the demand, but also induces a decrease in the tax revenues, while this will imply a lesser decline in demand in Nigeria accompanied however by a sharp increase of the country's tax revenues. This difference stems from the fact that the priceelasticity of tobacco demand is very high in Senegal, contrary to Nigeria. Finally, it is important to mention that there is a specific threshold beyond which the tax increases cease to have a positive effect on tax revenues in Nigeria.

AB Childhood abuse is a major public health problem that has been linked to depression in adulthood. Although different types of childhood abuse often co-occur, few studies have examined their unique impact on negative mental health outcomes. Most studies have focused solely on the consequences of childhood physical or sexual abuse; however, it has been suggested that childhood emotional abuse is more strongly related to depression. It remains unclear which underlying psychological processes mediate the effect of childhood emotional abuse on depressive symptoms. In a cross-sectional study in 276 female college students, multiple linear regression analyses were used to determine whether childhood emotional abuse, physical abuse, and sexual abuse were independently associated with depressive symptoms, emotion dysregulation, and interpersonal problems. Subsequently, OLS regression analyses were used to determine whether emotion dysregulation and interpersonal problems mediate the relationship between childhood emotional abuse and depressive symptoms. Of all types of abuse, only emotional abuse was independently associated with depressive symptoms, emotion dysregulation, and interpersonal problems. The effect of childhood emotional abuse on depressive symptoms was mediated by emotion dysregulation and the following domains of interpersonal problems: cold/distant and domineering/controlling. The results of the current study indicate that detection and prevention of childhood emotional abuse deserves attention from Child Protective Services. Finally, interventions that target emotion regulation skills and interpersonal skills may be beneficial in prevention of depression.

TI HIV diagnoses in migrant populations in Australia-A changing
   epidemiology
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MIGRATION; NORTHERN
AB Introduction
   We conducted a detailed analysis of trends in new HIV diagnoses in Australia by country of birth, to understand any changes in epidemiology, relationship to migration patterns and implications for public health programs.
   Methods
   Poisson regression analyses were performed, comparing the age-standardised HIV diagnosis rates per 100,000 estimated resident population between 2006-2010 and 2011-2015 by region of birth, with stratification by exposure (male-to-male sex, heterosexual sex-males and females). Correlation between the number of permanent and long-term arrivals was also explored using linear regression models.
   Results
   Between 2006 and 2015, there were 6,741 new HIV diagnoses attributed to male-to-male sex and 2,093 attributed to heterosexual sex, with the proportion of diagnoses attributed to male-to-male sex who were Australian-born decreasing from 72.5% to 66.5%. Compared with 2006-2010, the average annual HIV diagnosis rate per 100,000 in 2011-15 attributed to male-to-male sex was significantly higher in men born in South-East Asia (summary rate ratio (SRR) = 1.37, p = 0.001), North-East Asia (SRR = 2.18, p<0.001) and the Americas (SRR = 1.37, p = 0.025), but significantly lower as a result of heterosexual sex in men born in South-East Asia (SRR = 0.49, p = 0.002), Southern and Central Asia (SRR = 0.50, p = 0.014) and Sub-Saharan Africa (SRR = 0.39, p<0.001) and women born in South-East Asia (SRR = 0.61, p = 0.002) and Sub-Saharan Africa (SRR = 0.61, p<0.001). Positive associations were observed between the number of permanent and long-term arrivals and HIV diagnoses particularly in relation to diagnoses associated with male-to-male sex in men from North Africa and the Middle East, North Asia, Southern and Central Asia and the Americas.
   Conclusion
   The epidemiology of HIV in Australia is changing, with an increase in HIV diagnosis rates attributed to male-to-male sex amongst men born in Asia and the Americas. Tailored strategies must be developed to increase access to, and uptake of, prevention, testing and treatment in this group.

TI Impact of exposure to diesel exhaust during pregnancy on mammary gland

AB Exposure to fine-particulate air pollution is a major global health concern because it is associated with reduced birth weight and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Here we have investigated the potential for exposure to diesel exhaust during pregnancy to influence mammary gland development and milk composition. Female rabbits were therefore exposed by nose-only inhalation to either diluted diesel exhaust fumes (1 mg/m(3)) or clean air for 2h/day, 5 days/week, from the 3rd to the 27th days of pregnancy. On Day 28 of pregnancy, mammary glands were collected from twelve females (six controls and six diesel-exposed) and assessed for morphological and functional alterations. Milk samples were collected from eighteen dams (nine controls and nine diesel-exposed) during early (days 2 to 4) and established (days 13 to 16) lactation to verify the composition of fatty acids and major proteins and leptin levels. The mammary alveolar lumina contained numerous fat globules, and stearoyl CoA reductase expression was higher in mammary epithelia from diesel exhaust-exposed rabbits, which together suggested increased mammary lipid biosynthesis. Gas chromatography analysis of the composition of milk fatty acids revealed a sharp rise in the total fatty acid content, mainly due to monounsaturated fatty acids. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of milk samples enabled identification and quantification of the main rabbit milk proteins and their main phosphorylated isoforms, and revealed important changes to individual casein and whey protein contents and to their most phosphorylated isoforms during early lactation. Taken together, these findings suggest that repeated daily exposure to diesel exhaust fumes during pregnancy at urban pollution levels can influence lipid metabolism in the mammary gland and the lipid and protein composition of milk. As milk may contribute to metabolic programming, such alterations affecting milk composition should be taken into account from a public health perspective.

TI Immigrant Vietnamese women's adaptation to culture and society in rural
   areas of Korea
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID FOREIGN WIVES; MENTAL-HEALTH; Q-METHODOLOGY; ACCULTURATION; NURSES;
   EXPERIENCES; DEPRESSION; ATTITUDES; FAMILY
AB Background
   International marriages between Vietnamese women and Korean men have increased rapidly in Korea. Successful adaptation of these women is challenging, and concerns on the issue have been raised. Most existing studies have surveyed Vietnamese immigrant women in urban Korea; less is known about women residing in rural areas of Korea. Uncovering the experiences and perspectives of these women can inform the design of community support resources. The purpose of this study was to identify a typology to effectively describe the subjective perspectives of Vietnamese women residing in rural Korea on adaptation to Korean culture and society.
   Methods and results
   A Q-methodological study was conducted with five steps: construction of the concourse, Q sample, selection of participants, Q-sorting, and data analysis. Twenty-six Vietnamese women married to Korean men who attended local public health centers were surveyed and asked to rank-order 39 Q-statements using a 9-point scale. Principal component factor analysis using a pc-QUANL program was performed to identify adaptation sub-types. Four types of adaptation were identified and labeled: positive adaptation (35.54%), passive adaptation with reservations (8.33%), adaptation with frustration (6.20%), and adaptation and involvement (5.33%). These four types explained 55.40% of the total variance in the women's experience of adaptation to Korean culture and society.
   Conclusions
   This study provides data that may be helpful in understanding the challenges immigrant women in rural areas of Korea face, and in planning family-sensitive adaptation support programs for these women and their families.

   BURDEN
AB Human toxoplasmosis, a protozoonosis caused by Toxoplasma gondii, has been described as a worldwide foodborne disease with important public health impact. Despite infection has reportedly varied due to differences in alimentary, cultural and hygienic habits and geographic region, social vulnerability influence on toxoplasmosis distribution remains to be fully established. Accordingly, the present study has aimed to assess T. gondii seroprevalence and factors associated to social vulnerability for infection in households of Ivaipora, southern Brazil, with 33.6% population making half minimum wage or less, ranked 1,055th in population (31,816 habitants), 1,406th in per capita income (U$ 211.80 per month) and 1,021st in HDI (0.764) out of 5,570 Brazilian cities. Serum samples and epidemiological questionnaires were obtained from citizen volunteers with official City Secretary of Health assistance in 2015 and 2016. In overall, serosurvey has revealed 526/715 (73.57%) positive samples for anti-T. gondii antibodies by Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Test. Logistic regression has shown a significant increase associated to adults (p = 0.021) and elderly (p = 0.014) people, illiterates (p = 0.025), unemployment (p < 0.001) and lack of household water tank (p = 0.039). On the other hand, sex (male or female), living area (urban or rural), yard hygiene, meat ingestion, sand or land contact, owning pets (dog, cat or both) were not significant variables of positivity for anti-T. gondii antibodies in the surveyed population. Although no significant spatial cluster was found, high intensity areas of seropositive individuals were located in the Kernel map where the suburban neighborhoods are located. In conclusion, socioeconomic vulnerability determinants may be associated to Toxoplasma gondii exposure. The increased risk due to illiteracy, adult or elderly age, unemployment and lack of household water tank were confirmed by multivariate analysis and the influence of low family income for seropositivity by the spatial analysis.

TI Population size and self-reported characteristics and sexual preferences
   of men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) in Germany based on social network
   data
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID RISK-TAKING
AB Background
   In the absence of detailed information about the population size and behaviour data of men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM), the estimation of prevalence rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and the design of public health interventions become difficult. The aim of the present study is to estimate the lower boundary of age-specific population sizes and retrieve self-reported information from this population.
   Methods
   We used publicly accessible data from a large online dating and social network website for MSM in Germany to retrieve data on the age and regional distribution of profiles. The profiles were also stratified by their information on the preferred position during anal intercourse, safer sex, and sexual identity.
   Results
   A total of 464,873 user profiles correspond to an average 15.2 profiles per 1,000 male inhabitants in Germany, varying between 7.6 and 45.6 across federal states. Although the information on the absolute numbers for different age groups is limited by the search engine, age-specific relative frequencies were found to increase from 12.9 in the age group of 18 to 20 year olds to 24.6 profiles per 1,000 male inhabitants in the 28 to 30 year olds. The data shows age-specific trends for safer sex with an increasing easiness of reporting "never" engaging in safer sex or stating that safer sex "needs discussion" with increasing age. Around one third of profile owners stated to be versatile with respect to the preferred position in anal intercourse. All other options ("only bottom", "more bottom", "only top", "more top") were preferred equally likely by roughly 10% of profile owners, respectively.
   Conclusions
   Online social network or dating sites can provide some information about specific populations in the absence of other data sources. The presented results are the first to report age-specific rates of MSM per 1,000 male inhabitants in Germany and may be useful to estimate age-specific prevalence or incidence rates as well as to inform health promotion activities and modelling studies for MSM in Germany.

AB Anti-microbial resistance (AMR) is a global threat to public health and antibiotics are often unnecessarily prescribed for acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in general practice. We aimed to investigate why general practitioners (GPs) continue to prescribe antibiotics for ARTIs despite increasing knowledge of their poor efficacy and worsening antimicrobial resistance.
   We used an explorative qualitative study design. Thirteen GPs were recruited through purposive sampling to represent urban and rural settings and years of experience. They were based in general practices within the Mid-West of Ireland. GPs took part in semi-structured interviews that were digitally audio recorded and transcribed.
   Three main themes and three subthemes were identified. Themes include (1) non-comprehensive guidelines; how guideline adherence can be difficult, (2) GPs under pressure; pressures to prescribe from patients and perceived patient expectations and (3) Unnecessary prescribing; how to address it and the potential of public interventions to reduce it.
   GPs acknowledge their failure to implement guidelines because they feel they are less usable in clinical situations. GPs felt pressurised to prescribe, especially for fee-paying patients and in out of hours settings (OOH), suggesting the need for interventions that target the public's perceptions of antibiotics. GPs behaviours surrounding prescribing antibiotics need to change in order to reduce AMR and change patients' expectations.

AB With its emphasis on cost-reduction and external management, New Public Management emerged as the dominant healthcare policy in many Western countries. The ability to provide comprehensive and customized patient-care is challenged by the formalized, task-oriented organization of home-care services. The aim of this study is to gain deeper understanding of how nurses and the patients they care for, relate to and deal with the organizational systems they are subjected to in Norwegian home care.
   The focused ethnographic design is based on Roper and Shapira's framework. Data collection consisted of participant observation with field notes and semi-structured interviews with ten nurses and eight patients from six home care areas located in two Norwegian municipalities.
   Findings indicate cultural patterns regarding nurses' somewhat disobedient behaviors and manipulations of the organizational systems that they perceive to be based on economic as opposed to caring values. Rigid organization makes it difficult to deviate from predefined tasks and adapt nursing to patients changing needs, and manipulating the system creates some ability to tailor nursing care. The nurses' actions are founded on assumptions regarding what aspects of nursing are most important and essential to enhance patients' health and ensure wellbeing - individualized care, nurse-patient relationships and caring - which they perceive to be devalued by New Public Management organization. Findings show that patients share nurses' perceptions of what constitute high quality nursing, and they adjust their behavior to ease nurses' work, and avoid placing demands on nurses. Findings were categorized into three main areas: "Rigid organizational systems complicating nursing care at the expense of caring for patients", "Having the patient's health and wellbeing at heart" and "Compensating for a flawed system".
   Our findings indicate that, in many ways, the organizational system hampers provision of high-quality nursing, and that comprehensive care is provided in spite of - not because of - the system. The observed practices of nurses and patients are interpreted as ways of "gaming the system" for caring purposes, in order to ensure the best possible care for patients.

AB Suicide is a national public health crisis and a critical patient safety issue. It is the 10th leading cause of death overall and the second leading cause of death among adolescents and young adults (15-34 years old). Research shows 80% of youth who died by suicide saw their primary care provider within the year of their death. It is imperative that primary care providers develop the knowledge and skills to talk with patients about distress and suicidal thoughts, and to assess and respond in the context of the ongoing patient - primary care provider relationship.
   This study examines the effectiveness of simulation on suicide prevention training for providers-in-training by comparing two conditions: 1) a control group that receives online teaching on suicide prevention in primary care via brief online videos and 2) an experimental group that includes the same online teaching videos plus two standardized patient (SP) interactions (face-to-face and telehealth, presentation randomized). All SP interactions are video-recorded. The primary analysis is a comparison of the two groups' suicide prevention skills using an SP "test case" at 6-month follow-up.
   The primary research question examines the impact of practice (through SP simulation) over and above online teaching alone on suicide prevention skills demonstrated at follow-up. We will assess moderators of outcomes, differences among SP simulations (i.e., face-to-face vs. telehealth modalities), and whether the experimental group's suicide prevention skills improve over the three SP experiences.

TI Comparison of individual, group and environmental sampling strategies to

DT Article
DE Environment; Influenza; Pigs; Sampling; Surveillance; Udder wipe
ID A-VIRUS; SWINE
AB Influenza A virus (IAV) is an important pathogen in pigs that affects productivity and has important public health implications because of its zoonotic nature. Surveillance is central to the control of influenza, however, detection of IAV infections can be challenging in endemically infected herds with low prevalence of infection.
   In groups of suckling (18-21 days of age) and growing (35-45 days of age) pigs, we compared various sampling approaches to detect, isolate and sequence IAV using individual (nasal swabs, nasal wipes and oropharyngeal swabs), group (oral fluids, surface wipes and sow udder skin wipes) and environmental (airborne particles deposited on surfaces and air samples) sampling approaches. All samples were tested by IAV rRT-PCR and a subset was used for virus isolation and direct sequencing.
   In general, environmental and group samples resulted in higher odd ratios (range = 3.87-16.5, p-value < 0.05) of detecting a positive sample by rRT-PCR compared to individual pooled samples, except for oropharyngeal swabs (OR = 8.07, p-value < 0.05). In contrast, individual samples were most likely to yield a viral isolate by cell culture. Oropharyngeal swabs in suckling pigs (78.4%), and nasal swabs (47.6%) or nasal wipes (45%) in growing pigs, and udder wipes in lactating sows (75%) were the preferred samples to obtain an isolate.
   Our findings indicate that group and environmental sampling strategies should be considered in influenza surveillance programs in particular if the goal is just to detect infection. This study provides new information on sampling approaches to conduct effective influenza surveillance in pigs and identifies udder wipes from lactating sows as a novel sample type that offers a convenient, cheap and sensitive manner to monitor IAV in litters prior to weaning.

   RELIGIOSITY/SPIRITUALITY; INTERVENTIONS
AB Background
   Alcohol and other drug use (AOD) and risky sexual behaviours remain high among adolescents in South Africa and globally. Religiosity influences, mitigates and provides resilience against engaging in risky behaviours among young people but few South African studies have explored potential associations between religiosity, AOD use and risky sex. We report the prevalence of religiosity and association between religiosity and AOD use and risky sexual behaviours among learners in the Western Cape Province, South Africa.
   Methods
   Between May and August 2011, a cross sectional survey was conducted among 20 227 learners from 240 public schools randomly selected through a stratified multistage sampling design to determine the prevalence of AOD use and sexual risk behaviours. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to assess the association between religiosity, AOD use and risky sexual behaviours.
   Results
   The learners were aged 10-23 years. Almost three quarters (74%) of learners reported high religiosity (defined as attending religious services or activities at least 1-2 times a month). More female than male learners had high religiosity. The prevalence of past 30 day reported alcohol, tobacco and cannabis use was 23%, 19% and 8% respectively. Compared to learners with low religiosity, those with high religiosity were less likely to engage in AOD use: specifically alcohol use, (AOR = 0.86, 95%CI: 0.76-0.97), tobacco use (AOR = 0.76, 95%CI: 0.67-0.87), cannabis use (AOR = 0.57, 95%CI: 0.48-0.68) in the last 30 days. They were also less likely to engage in risky sexual behaviours (AOR = 0.90, 95%CI: 0.81-0.99).
   Conclusion
   Religiosity was associated with lower odds of reported AOD use and risky sexual behaviours among learners in the Western Cape. This calls for further exploration on how to incorporate religiosity into AOD use and risky sexual behaviour interventions.

TI Austerity measures and the transforming role of A&E professionals in a
   weakening welfare system
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; FINANCIAL CRISIS; HEALTH; IMPACT; UK
AB In 2010, the UK embarked on a self-imposed programme of contractionary measures signalling the beginning of a so-called "age of austerity" for the country. It was argued that budgetary cuts were the most appropriate means of eliminating deficits and decreasing national debt as percentage of General Domestic Product (GDP). Although the budget for the National Health Service (NHS) was not reduced, a below-the-average increase in funding, and cuts in other areas of public spending, particularly in social care and welfare spending, impacted significantly on the NHS. One of the areas where the impact of austerity was most dramatically felt was in Accidents and Emergency Departments (A&E). A number of economic and statistical reports and quantitative studies have explored and documented the effects of austerity in healthcare in the UK, but there is a paucity of research looking at the effects of austerity from the standpoint of the healthcare professionals. In this paper, we report findings from a qualitative study with healthcare professionals working in A&E departments in England. The study findings are presented thematically in three sections. The main theme that runs through all three sections is the perceptions of austerity as shaping the functioning of A&E departments, of healthcare professions and of professionals themselves. The first section discusses the rising demand for services and resources, and the changed demographic of A&E patients-altering the meaning of A&E from 'Accidents and Emergencies' to the Department for 'Anything and Everything'. The second section in this study's findings, explores how austerity policies are perceived to affect the character of healthcare in A&E. It discusses how an increased focus on the procedures, time-keeping and the operationalisation of healthcare is considered to detract from values such as empathy in interactions with patients. In the third section, the effects of austerity on the morale and motivations of healthcare professionals themselves are presented. Here, the concepts of moral distress and burnout are used in the analysis of the experiences and feelings of being devalued. From these accounts and insights, we analyse austerity as a catalyst or mechanism for a significant shift in the practice and function of the NHS-in particular, a shift in what is counted, measured and valued at departmental, professional and personal levels in A&E.

TI Community health workers trained to conduct verbal autopsies provide
   better mortality measures than existing surveillance: Results from a
   cross-sectional study in rural western Uganda
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CIVIL REGISTRATION; DEATH
AB Background
   In much of sub-Saharan Africa, health facilities serve as the primary source of routine vital statistics. These passive surveillance systems, however, are plagued by infrequent and unreliable reporting and do not capture events that occur outside of the formal health sector. Verbal autopsies (VA) have been utilized to estimate the burden and causes of mortality where civil registration and vital statistics systems are weak, but VAs have not been widely employed in national surveillance systems. In response, we trained lay community health workers (CHW) in a rural sub-county of western Uganda to conduct VA interviews in order to assess the feasibility of leveraging CHW to measure the burden of disease in resource limited settings.
   Methods and findings
   Trained CHWs conducted a cross-sectional survey of the 36 villages comprising the Bugoye sub-county to identify all deaths occurring in the prior year. The sub county has an estimated population of 50,249, approximately one-quarter of whom are children under 5 years of age (25.3%). When an eligible death was reported, CHWs administered a WHO 2014 VA questionnaire, the results of which were analyzed using the InterVA-4 tool. To compare the findings of the CHW survey to existing surveillance systems, study staff reviewed inpatient registers from neighboring referral health facilities in an attempt to match recorded deaths to those identified by the survey. Overall, CHWs conducted high quality VA interviews on direct observation, identifying 230 deaths that occurred within the sub-county, including 77(33.5%) among children under five years of age. More than half of the deaths (123 of 230, 53.5%) were reported to have occurred outside a health facility and thus would not be captured by passive surveillance. More than two-thirds (73 of 107, 68.2%) of facility deaths took place in one of three nearby hospitals, yet only 35 (47.9%) were identified on our review of inpatient registers. Consistent with previous VA studies, the leading causes of death among children under five years of age were malaria (19.5%), prematurity (19.5%), and neonatal pneumonia (15.6%). while among adults, HIV/AIDS-related deaths illness (13.6%), pulmonary tuberculosis (11.4%) and malaria (8.6%) were the leading causes of death. No child deaths identified from inpatient registers listed HIV/AIDS as a cause of death despite 8 deaths (10.4%) attributed to HIV/AIDS as determined by VA.
   Conclusions
   Lay CHWs are able to conduct high quality VA interviews to capture critical information that can be analyzed using standard methodologies to provide a more complete estimate of the burden and causes of mortality. Similar approaches can be scaled to improve the measurement of vital statistics in order to facilitate appropriate public health interventions in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa.

TI Healthcare workers' experiences regarding scaling up of training on
   integrated disease surveillance and response (IDSR) in Uganda, 2016:

ID IMPLEMENTATION; CHALLENGES
AB Background: The Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy was adopted as the framework for implementation of International Health Regulation (2005) in the African region of World Health Organisation (WHO AFRO). While earlier studies documented gains in performance of core IDSR functions, Uganda still faces challenges due to infectious diseases. IDSR revitalisation programme aimed to improve prevention, early detection, and prompt response to disease outbreaks. However, little is known about health worker's perception of the revitalised IDSR training.
   Methods: We conducted focus group discussions of health workers who were trained between 2015 and 2016. Discussions on benefits, challenges and possible solutions for improvement of IDSR training were recorded, transcribed, translated and coded using grounded theory.
   Results: In total, 22/26 FGDs were conducted. Participants cited improved completeness and timeliness of reporting, case detection and data analysis and better response to disease outbreaks as key achievements after the training. Programme challenges included an inadequate number of trained staff, funding, irregular supervision, high turnover of trained health workers, and lack of key logistics. Suggestions to improve IDSR included pre-service and community training, mentorship, regular supervision and improving funding at the district level.
   Conclusion: Health workers perceived that scaling up revitalized IDSR training in Uganda improved public health surveillance. However, they acknowledge encountering challenges that hinder their performance after the training. Ministry of Health should have a mentorship plan, integrate IDSR training in pre-service curricula and advocate for funding IDSR activities to address some of the gaps highlighted in this study.

TI Social network analysis and whole genome sequencing in a cohort study to
   investigate TB transmission in an educational setting
SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
DE Tuberculosis; Outbreak; Screening; Whole genome sequencing; Social
   network analysis
ID TUBERCULOSIS OUTBREAK; RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; SCHOOL; EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Background: TB outbreaks in educational institutions can result in significant transmission and pose a considerable threat to TB control. Investigation using traditional microbiological and epidemiological tools can lead to imprecise screening strategies due to difficulties characterising complex transmission networks. Application of whole genome sequencing (WGS) and social network analysis can provide additional information that may facilitate rapid directed public health action. We report the utility of these methods in combination with traditional approaches for the first time to investigate a TB outbreak in an educational setting.
   Methods: Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) cases were screenees with a positive T-SPOT (R).TB test. Active TB cases were defined through laboratory confirmation of M. tuberculosis on culture or through clinical or radiological findings consistent with infection. Epidemiological data were collected from institutional records and screenees. Samples were cultured and analysed using traditional M. tuberculosis typing and WGS. We undertook multivariable multinomial regression and social network analysis to identify exposures associated with case status and risk communities.
   Results: We identified 189 LTBI cases (13.7% positivity rate) and nine active TB cases from 1377 persons screened. The LTBI positivity rate was 39.1% (99/253) among persons who shared a course with an infectious case (odds ratio 7.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.2 to 10.3). The community structure analysis divided the students into five communities based on connectivity, as opposed to the 11 shared courses. Social network analysis identified that the community including the suspected index case was at significantly elevated risk of active disease (odds ratio 7.5, 95% CI 1.3 to 44.0) and contained eight persons who were lost to follow-up. Five sputum samples underwent WGS, four had zero single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences and one had a single SNP difference.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates the public health impact an undiagnosed case of active TB disease can have in an educational setting within a low incidence area. Social network analysis and whole genome sequencing provided greater insight to evolution of the transmission network and identification of communities of risk. These tools provide further information over traditional epidemiological and microbiological approaches to direct public health action in this setting.

SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
DE Zika; Malaysia; Epidemiology
ID PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; CROSS-REACTIVITY; TRANSMISSION; OUTBREAK;
   WORLDWIDE; MOSQUITOS; SPREAD; ASSAY
AB Background: A major outbreak of the Zika virus (ZIKV) has been reported in Brazil in 2015. Since then, it spread further to other countries in the Americas and resulted in declaration of the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by World Health Organization. In 2016, Singapore reported its first minor ZIKV epidemic. Malaysia shares similar ecological environment as Brazil and Singapore which may also favor ZIKV transmission. However, no ZIKV outbreak has been reported in Malaysia to date. This study aimed to discuss all confirmed ZIKV cases captured under Malaysia ZIKV surveillance system after declaration of the PHEIC; and explore why Malaysia did not suffer a similar ZIKV outbreak as the other two countries.
   Methods: This was an observational study reviewing all confirmed ZIKV cases detected in Malaysia through the ZIKV clinical surveillance and Flavivirus laboratory surveillance between June 2015 and December 2017. All basic demographic characteristics, co-morbidities, clinical, laboratory and outcome data of the confirmed ZIKV cases were collected from the source documents.
   Results: Only eight out of 4043 cases tested positive for ZIKV infection during that period. The median age of infected patients was 48.6 years and majority was Chinese. Two of the subjects were pregnant. The median interval between the onset of disease and the first detection of ZIKV Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) in body fluid was 3 days. Six cases had ZIKV RNA detected in both serum and urine samples. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that isolates from the 7 cases of ZIKV infection came from two clusters, both of which were local circulating strains.
   Conclusion: Despite similar ecological background characteristics, Malaysia was not as affected by the recent ZIKV outbreak compared to Brazil and Singapore. This could be related to pre-existing immunity against ZIKV in this population, which developed after the first introduction of the ZIKV in Malaysia decades ago. A serosurvey to determine the seroprevalence of ZIKV in Malaysia was carried out in 2017. The differences in circulating ZIKV strains could be another reason as to why Malaysia seemed to be protected from an outbreak.

AB Background: Chronic periodontitis (CP), defines as destruction of the supporting tissues of the teeth and resorption of the alveolar bone. It is widespread in human populations and represent an important problem for public health. CP results from inflammatory mechanisms created by the interaction between environmental and host genetic factors that confer the individual susceptibility to the disease.
   Aim: The aim of the current study was to explore and summarize some functional biomarkers that are associated with CP susceptibility.
   Methods: CP is considered to be a multifactorial disease. The pathogenesis of multifactorial diseases is characterized by various biological pathways. The studies revealed that polymorphisms were associated with susceptibility to periodontal diseases. In other word, genetic variations can change the development of CP. However, there are some conflicting results, because there are different variations in frequency of some alleles in any populations. Therefore, we conducted the current review to completely understanding the special biomarkers for CP.
   Results: There is some evidence that SNPs in the IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL1RN, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta 1, IFN-gamma and VDR may be associated with CP susceptibility.
   Conclusion: In conclusion, numerous studies have reported the host genetic factors associated with CP susceptibility and related traits. Therefore, it is prevail to study the multiple SNPs and their effects to find the useful diagnosis methods. The current study will investigate the relationship between polymorphisms in cytokine genes and the susceptibility to the chronic periodontitis.

AB BackgroundHealth behaviours during pregnancy and the early years of life have been proven to affect long term health, resulting in investment in interventions. However, interventions often have low levels of completion and limited effectiveness. Consequently, it is increasingly important for interventions to be based on both behaviour change theories and techniques, and the accounts of pregnant women. This study engaged with pregnant women from deprived communities, to understand their subjective experiences of health in pregnancy.MethodsThe study adopted a women-centred ethos and recruited a purposive sample of ten pregnant women, who lived in deprived areas and were on low incomes. Participants engaged with three creative techniques of visual data production (timelines, collaging and dyad sandboxing), followed by elicitation interviews. One participant only engaged in the initial activity and interview, resulting in a total of 28 elicitation interviews. This in-depth qualitative approach was designed to enable a nuanced account of the participants' thoughts, everyday experiences and social relationships. Data were deductively coded for alcohol, smoking and infant feeding and then mapped to the COM-B model (Capability, Opportunity, Motivation - Behaviour).ResultsFive participants had experience of smoking during pregnancy, four had consumed alcohol during pregnancy, and all participants, except one who had exclusively formula fed her child, disclosed a range of infant feeding experiences and intentions for their current pregnancies. Considerable variation was identified between the drivers of behaviour around infant feeding and that related to abstinence from tobacco and alcohol during pregnancy. Overall, knowledge and confidence (psychological capability), the role of partners (social opportunity) and support from services to overcome physical challenges (environmental opportunity) were reported to impact on (reflective) motivation, and thus women's behaviour. The role of the public in creating and reinforcing stigma (social opportunity) was also noted in relation to all three behaviours.ConclusionsWhen designing new interventions to improve maternal health behaviours it is important to consider the accounts of pregnant women. Acknowledging pregnant women's subjective experiences and the challenges they face in negotiating acceptable forms of motherhood, can contribute to informed policy and practice, which can engage rather than isolate potential user groups.

ID HEALTH-CARE STUDENTS; PREVENTABLE DISEASES; COVERAGE; HOSPITALS
AB Background: Medical students are at risk of contracting and transmitting infectious diseases such as pertussis. Complete vaccination status is important to protect own, patient and public health. Knowing own vaccination status is elementary for following current vaccination recommendations, including boosters. We aimed to assess pertussis vaccination status and vaccination acceptance among medical students of different nationalities.
   Methods: A cross-sectional multicenter health survey at German and Hungarian universities enclosed international medical students in the 1st, 3rd and 5th year of study. Self-reported data from 2655 students regarding pertussis vaccination status were analyzed. Subgroup analysis enclosed data of German (n = 1217), Hungarian (n = 960) and other nationality (n = 478) students ("other").
   Results: More Hungarians reported basic immunization (39.0% vs 15.8% Germans vs 24.3% others, p <= 0.05). Booster vaccination was reported more by Germans (60.5% vs 43.6% Hungarians vs 36.0% others, p <= 0.05). Germans were more likely to report being unvaccinated (3.7% vs 0.9% Hungarians, p <= 0.05). More medical students of other nationalities were unaware of their pertussis vaccination status (37.4% vs 20.0% Germans/ 16.5% Hungarians, p <= 0.05). 75.2% (n = 1931) rated pertussis vaccinations as absolutely necessary (86.2% Hungarians vs 69.8% Germans/ 66.1% others, p <= 0.05).
   Conclusions: Positive attitudes towards vaccinations were reported but a large group reported insufficient vaccination status and being not aware of their status, especially among international students. Hungarians possibly have a better vaccination status than reported, based on mandatory vaccinations in childhood. The low awareness of vaccination status has implications for future booster vaccinations. All students should be informed about current recommendations and receive vaccination offers in frames of low-threshold medical services.

TI The availability, prices and affordability of essential medicines in
   Malawi: A cross-sectional study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Introduction
   The Malawian government recently introduced cost-covering consultation fees for self-referral patients in tertiary public hospitals. Previously, patients received medicines free of charge in government-owned health facilities, but must pay elsewhere. Before the government implements a payment policy in other areas of health care, it is important to investigate the prices, affordability and availability of essential medicines in Malawi.
   Methods
   Data on availability and prices of 50 essential medicines were collected in 44 health facilities in two major cities and two districts. These included 12 public facilities, 11 facilities of the Christian Health Association of Malawi (CHAM), nine retail pharmacies, eight wholesalers and four private clinics/hospitals. Price, availability and affordability were assessed based on the methodology developed by the World Health Organization and Health Action International, which compares local prices to international reference prices.
   Results and discussion
   The overall availability of medicines was 48.5% in public facilities, 71.1% in retail pharmacies, 62.9% in CHAM facilities and 57.5% in private clinics. The availability of essential medicines varied from 0% for ethosuximide to 100% for amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole tablets. Antibiotic formulations for adults were widely available, in contrast to the low availability of pediatric formulations. Several medicines for non-communicable diseases like sodium valproate, phenytoin, paraldehyde, captopril and simvastatin showed poor availability and affordability. The overall median price ratio compared to the international reference price was 1.11 for wholesalers, 2.54 in CHAM facilities, 2.70 in retail pharmacies, and 4.01 in private clinics, which is low compared to other countries. But nevertheless, for 18 out of 32 medicines assessed, the cost of one course exceeded the statutory minimum daily wage, making them unaffordable to a majority of the population. Therefore, continued provision of free public health care is still of critical importance for the foreseeable future until other financing mechanisms have been explored.

TI Financial risk protection at the bedside: How Ethiopian physicians try
   to minimize out-of-pocket health expenditures
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID LIFE DECISIONS; CARE; COSTS; CONSEQUENCES; INCOME; PAY
AB Background
   Out-of-pocket health expenditures can pose major financial risks, create access-barriers and drive patients and families into poverty. Little is known about physicians' role in financial protection of patients and families at the bedside in low-income settings and how they perceive their roles and duties when treating patients in a health care system requiring high out-of-pocket costs.
   Objective
   Assess physicians' concerns regarding financial welfare of patients and their families and analyze physicians' experiences in reducing catastrophic health expenditures for patients in Ethiopia.
   Method
   A national survey was conducted among physicians at 49 public hospitals in six regions in Ethiopia. Descriptive statistics were used.
   Results
   Totally 587 physicians responded (response rate 91%) and 565 filled the inclusion criteria. Health care costs driving people into financial crisis and poverty were witnessed by 82% of respondants, and 88% reported that costs for the patient are important when deciding to use or not use an intervention. Several strategies to save costs for patients were used: 37-79% of physicians were doing this daily or weekly through limiting prescription of drugs, limiting radiologic studies, ultrasound and lab tests, providing second best treatments, and avoiding admission or initiating early discharge. Overall, 75% of the physicians reported that ongoing and future costs to patients influenced their decisions to a greater extent than concerns for preserving hospital resources.
   Conclusion
   In Ethiopia, a low-income country aiming to move towards universal health coverage, physicians view themselves as both stewards of public resources, patient advocates and financial protectors of patients and their families. Their high concern for family welfare should be acknowledged and the economic and ethical implications of this practice must be further explored.

AB The early identification and prevention of dementia is important for reducing its worldwide burden and increasing individuals' quality of life. Although several dementia prediction models have been developed, there remains a need for a practical and precise model targeted to middle-aged and Asian populations. Here, we used national Korean health examination data from adults (331,126 individuals, 40-69 years of age, mean age: 52 years) from 2002-2003 to predict the incidence of dementia after 10 years. We divided the dataset into two cohorts to develop and validate of our prediction model. Cox proportional hazards models were used to construct dementia prediction models for the total group and sex-specific subgroups. Receiver operating characteristics curves, C-statistics, calibration plots, and cumulative hazards were used to validate model performance. Discriminative accuracy as measured by C-statistics was 0.81 in the total group (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.81 to 0.82), 0.81 in the male subgroup (CI = 0.80 to 0.82), and 0.81 in the female subgroup (CI = 0.80 to 0.82). Significant risk factors for dementia in the total group were age; female sex; underweight; current hypertension; comorbid psychiatric or neurological disorder; past medical history of cardio-vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, or hypertension; current smoking; and no exercise. All identified risk factors were statistically significant in the sex-specific subgroups except for low body weight and current hypertension in the female subgroup. These results suggest that public health examination data can be effectively used to predict dementia and facilitate the early identification of dementia within a middle-aged Asian population.

AB BackgroundAccess to qualitative HIV PCRs for early infant diagnosis (EID) is restricted in resource-limited settings due to cost. We hypothesised that pooling of dried blood spots (DBS), defined as combining multiple patient samples in a single test with subsequent individual testing of positive pools, would be cost saving while retaining clinical accuracy compared to individual patient testing.MethodsCost savings: A model was developed to simulate reagent and consumable cost saving of pooled compared to individual sample testing. Daily sample/result data of a public health laboratory in South Africa were used to illustrate outputs from the model. Samples were randomly allocated to pools and the process was repeated 1000 times to measure variation in estimates due to this stochasticity.Clinical accuracy: 1170 patient samples were tested using the Roche CAP/CTM Qual assay in pools of five 50l DBS. Negative pools comprised DBS previously tested in single reactions; positive pools included 1 positive sample.ResultsPooling would have saved 64% of laboratory costs in 2015. The model is published as an R-based web tool, into which the user enters sample/positivity estimates and workflow management parameters to obtain cost saving estimates at an optimal pool size.Sensitivity of pooled testing was 98.8% overall; 100% for strongly reactive pools. One pool tested false positive which would not impact clinical specificity as individual patient testing is performed prior to reporting.ConclusionsPooled PCR testing for EID remains accurate and dramatically reduces costs in settings with moderate to low prevalence rates and sufficient sample numbers.

AB BackgroundWith an increased incidence of viral zoonoses, there is an impetus to strengthen collaborations between public health, agricultural and environmental departments. This interdisciplinary cooperation, also known as the One Health' approach, has received significant support from various stakeholders. However, current efforts and policies still fall short of those needed for an effective One Health approach towards disease control and prevention. The avian-origin H7N9 influenza A virus outbreak in China serves as an ideal case study to emphasise this point.DiscussionHere, we present the features and epidemiology of human infections with H7N9 influenza virus. At the early stages of the H7N9 epidemic, there was limited virus surveillance and limited prevention measures implemented in live poultry markets. As a result, zoonotic infections with H7N9 influenza viruses continued to enlarge in both numbers and geographic distribution. It was only after the number of human infections with H7N9 influenza virus spiked in the 5th wave of the epidemic that inter-departmental alliances were formed. This resulted in the rapid control of the number of human infections. We therefore further discuss the barriers that prevented the implementation of an effective One Health approach in China and what this means for other emerging, zoonotic viral diseases.SummaryEffective implementation of evidence-based disease management approaches in China will result in substantial health and economic gains. The continual threat of avian influenza, as well as other emerging zoonotic viral infections, emphasizes the need to remove the barriers that prevent the effective implementation of One Health policies in disease management.

AB BackgroundLow back pain is one of the most prevalent musculoskeletal conditions and the highest contributor to disability in the world. It is characterized by frequent relapses leading to additional care-seeking. Engagement in leisure physical activity is associated with lower recurrences and better prognosis and potentially reduced care-seeking. Our aim was to investigate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a patient-centred physical activity intervention, supported by health coaching and mobile health, to reduce care-seeking, pain and disability in patients with chronic low back pain after treatment discharge.MethodsWe conducted a pilot randomised controlled trial with blinded outcome assessment. Sixty-eight participants were recruited from four public outpatient physiotherapy departments and the general community in Sydney. The intervention group received a physical activity information booklet, plus one face-to-face and 12 telephone-based health coaching sessions. The intervention was supported by an internet-based application and an activity tracker (Fitbit). Control group (standard care) received the physical activity information booklet and advice to stay active. Feasibility measures included recruitment rate, intervention compliance, data completeness, and participant satisfaction. Primary outcomes were care-seeking, pain levels and activity limitation. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 6-month follow-up and weekly for 6months.ResultsNinety potential participants were invited over 15months, with 68 agreeing to take part (75%). Overall, 903 weekly questionnaires were answered by participants from a total of 1107 sent (89%). Participants were largely satisfied with the intervention (mean=8.7 out of 10 on satisfaction scale). Intervention group participants had a 38% reduced rate of care-seeking (Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR): 0.62, 95% CI: 0.32 to 1.18, p=0.14, using multilevel mixed-effects Poisson regression analysis) compared to standard care, although none of the estimates was statistically significant. No between groups differences were found for pain levels or activity limitation.ConclusionThe health coaching physical activity approach trialed here is feasible and well accepted by participants and may reduce care-seeking in patients with low back pain after treatment discharge, although further evaluation with an adequately powered trial is needed.Trial registrationAustralian and New Zealand Trial Registry ACTRN12615000189527.

AB BackgroundMembers of the public can potentially take action to assist someone in their social network who is distressed and at risk of suicide. The present study used data from a community survey to examine training experiences and sociodemographic factors associated with the quality of assistance provided in such situations.MethodsA national telephone survey using random digit dialing was carried out with Australian adults on attitudes and intentions toward helping someone in severe distress or at risk of suicide, as well as actions taken. Participants were asked open-ended questions about their intentions to assist a hypothetical person in a vignette and about any actions they took to assist a family member or friend in distress over the previous 12months. Each participant randomly received 1 of 6 vignettes which varied by gender and degree of suicidality portrayed. 3002 participants provided data on intentions and 932 on actions taken. Quality of Intentions and Quality of Actions were scored on 12-point scales.ResultsQuality of Intentions and Quality of Actions correlated 0.28. Quality of Intentions was associated with more overt suicidality in the vignette, age 31-59years, female gender, university education, speaking English at home, being non-Indigenous and all forms of suicide training (professional, Mental Health First Aid and other). Quality of Actions was associated with female gender, university education and other suicide training.ConclusionsTraining on suicide prevention is associated with better quality of intentions and actions to help a person at risk of suicide. There are sub-groups in the population who are in greater need of such training because they have poorer quality of intentions to help and are less likely to have received training. These include males, less educated people and people from non-English speaking backgrounds.

AB BackgroundThe World Health Organization (WHO) has included comorbidity between depression and a chronic disease among the 10 leading global health priorities. Although there is a high prevalence of multimorbidity, health care systems are mainly designed for the management of individual diseases. Given the difficulty in delivering face-to-face psychological treatments, alternative models of treatment delivery have been proposed, emphasizing the role of technologies such as the Internet. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy in Primary Care (PC) of a blended low-intensity psychological intervention applied using information and communication technologies (ICTs) for the treatment of multimorbidity in PC (depression and type 2 diabetes/low back pain) by means of a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Our main hypothesis is that improved usual care combined with psychological therapy applied using ICTs will be more efficacious for improvement in the symptomatology of multimorbidity, compared to a group with only improved treatment as usual six months after the end of treatment.MethodsA protocol has been designed combining a face-to-face intervention with a supporting online programme that will be tested by an RCT conducted in three different regions (Andalusia, Aragon and the Balearic Islands). The RCT will evaluate three hundred participants diagnosed with depression and type 2 diabetes/low back pain. Four highly experienced research groups specializing in clinical psychology are involved in this trial, and there will be ample possibilities for translation and transfer to usual clinical practice.DiscussionThis clinical trial will lead to improvement in financial sustainability, maximizing the use of resources and responding to principles of efficiency and effectiveness. Furthermore, based on the evaluation of the feasibility of implementing this intervention in primary care facilities, we expect to be able to suggest the intervention for incorporation into public policy. In conclusion, positive results of this study could have a significant impact on one of the most important health-related problems, multimorbidity.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03426709.

TI Five-year lung cancer mortality risk analysis and topography in Xuan
   Wei: a spatiotemporal correlation analysis
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH

ID EPIDEMIOLOGY; BURDEN
AB BackgroundIn Xuan Wei, China, the lung cancer mortality rate is rising significantly more than that of the nation overall. However, it remains unclear 1) if improved diagnosis can just partially explain this observation and how other local risk factors may be correlated with the lung cancer mortality rate and 2) how the lung cancer mortality rates differ within Xuan Wei and how these spatiotemporal patterns are linked with local risk factors. To increase etiological knowledge, this study evaluated the spatial and temporal distributions of the health effects (the lung cancer mortality rates) from 2011 to 2015.MethodsFour steps of spatial analysis were applied, as follows: 1) hotspot analysis to determine the geographical patterns of lung cancer mortality, 2) spatially-weighted sum to identify areas with higher health risks, 3) bivariate statistical analysis to assess the overall correlation between coal mines and lung cancer mortality, and 4) geographically-weighted regression to test for correlations among different towns within Xuan Wei.ResultsWomen had higher lung cancer mortality rates than those in men, with an increasing trend in both sexes over time. The incidence rates in Laibin Town were the highest in Xuan Wei every year. Over the 5-year study period, the lung cancer mortality was increasingly concentrated in Laibin, Shuanglong, and Longchang, where the smoky coal mines are most concentrated. The population-level health risks from the coal mine in Xuan Wei were mapped and divided into five types of risk areas (Type I - Type IV). Correlation analysis revealed that there was no significant correlation between lung cancer mortality as a whole and coal mine distribution during the 5-year study period. However, the geographically-weighted regression revealed a stronger correlation in medium (Type III) and second-lowest (Type IV) health risks.ConclusionsXuan Wei lung cancer mortality has increased continuously since the third national retrospective surveys on the causes of death by the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China (2004-2005), especially for local women and residents over 35years of age. Geographically, lung cancer in Xuan Wei showed unique spatiotemporal clustering. The local lung cancer mortality was significantly correlated with the smoky coal mine geographically. Some specific towns (Laibin, Shuanglong, and Longchang) within Xuan Wei manifested high correlations between lung cancer mortality and coal mines. The effects of coal mines on lung cancer mortality rates also spread geographically outward from these areas. Public health concern regarding lung cancer in Xuan Wei should prioritize higher-risk towns surrounded by smoking coal mines. Intervention strategies for particular toxic coal types require further studies on their chemical characteristics and mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Additional studies are also warranted to systematically examine the local environmental health risks related to coal industries and combustion air pollution and eventually to conduct early screening of lung cancer for local people who are more exposed to smoky coal in high-risk areas.

AB BackgroundThis study aimed to use marketing theory to examine the views of patients, pharmacists and general practitioners (GPs) on how community pharmacies are currently used and to identify how community pharmacy services may be better integrated within the primary care pathway for people with long-term conditions (LTCs).MethodsA qualitative research design was used. Two focus groups were conducted with respiratory patients (n=6, 5) and two with type 2 diabetes patients (both n=5). Two focus groups were held with pharmacists (n=7, 5) and two with GPs (both n=5). The 7Ps marketing mix (product, price, place, promotion, people, process, physical evidence) was used to frame data collection and analysis. Data was analysed using thematic analysis.ResultsDue to the access and convenience of community pharmacies (place), all stakeholder groups recommended using community pharmacies over GP practices for services such as management of minor ailments, medication reviews and routine check-ups for well managed LTCs (product). All stakeholder groups preferred pharmacy services with clear specifications which focused on specific interventions to reduce variability in service delivery and quality (process). However, all stressed the importance of having an appropriate system to share relevant information, allowing pharmacists and GPs two-way flow (process). Pharmacists and GPs mentioned difficulties in collaborating with each other due to inter-professional tensions arising from funding conflicts, which leads to duplication of services and inefficient workflow within the primary care pathway (people). Patients and GPs were sometimes doubtful of community pharmacies' potential to expand services due to limited space, size and poor quality consultation rooms (physical evidence). However, all stakeholder groups recommended promoting community pharmacy services locally and nationally (promotion). Patients felt the most effective form of promotion was first-hand experience of high quality pharmacy services and peer word-of-mouth. The added value of using pharmacy services was faster access and convenience for patients, and freeing up GPs' time to focus on more complex patients (value).ConclusionsUsing the 7Ps marketing mix highlighted factors which could influence utilisation and integration of community pharmacy services within the primary care pathway for patients with LTCs. Further research is needed to identify their relative importance.

AB BackgroundHearing loss is a global public health problem putting millions of people at risk of experiencing impediments in communication and potentially impaired mental health. Many studies in this field are based on small, cross sectional samples using self-report measures. The present study aims to investigate the association between childhood sensorineural hearing loss and mental health in adult men and women longitudinally in a large cohort with a matched control group, and hearing is measured by pure-tone audiometry. Studies of this kind are virtually non-existing.MethodsThe present study combines data from two large studies; the School Hearing Investigation in Nord-TrOndelag (SHINT) carried out yearly from 1954 to 1986, and the second wave of the Nord-TrOndelag Health Study (HUNT 2) conducted from 1995 to 1997. The participants were 7, 10 or 13years during the SHINT, and between 20 and 56years old during HUNT 2. The total sample consisted of 32,456 participants (of which 32,104 in the reference group). Participants with a sensorineural hearing loss in SHINT of 41dB or more were classified with moderate-severe hearing loss (N=66), 26-40dB as mild (N=66) and 16-25dB as slight (N=220). Mental health in adulthood was measured in HUNT 2 by symptoms of anxiety and depression, subjective well-being, and self-esteem. The association between childhood sensorineural hearing loss and adult mental health was tested by means of ANOVA.ResultsThere was a significant relation between slight childhood sensorineural hearing loss and lowered subjective well-being in women (B=-.25, p=0.038). Further investigation of the results revealed a significant association between slight hearing loss and symptoms of anxiety and depression (B=.30, p=0.054) and between mild hearing loss and lowered self-esteem (B=.63, p=0.024) among women aged 20-39years. There were no significant relations between childhood sensorineural hearing loss and any of the three mental health outcomes among men.ConclusionsThis study suggests that women with slight or mild sensorineural hearing loss from childhood experience elevated levels of symptoms of anxiety and depression, lowered subjective well-being and lowered self-esteem. However, the results should be interpreted with caution due to a lack of power in some analyses.

AB Objective
   To estimate the effect of inadequate maternal weight gain in the third trimester on the risk of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) in rural Bangladesh.
   Methods
   This study analyzed data from 1,463 mother-infant pairs in Matlab, Bangladesh which were available through the electronic databases of Matlab Health and Demographic Surveillance System and Matlab hospital of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr, b). All the mothers were admitted to Matlab hospital for childbirth from January 2012 to December 2014, and they had singleton live births at term. Third-trimester weight gain (kg) was calculated by subtracting the estimated weight at the end of the second trimester from the weight taken before childbirth. Inadequate third-trimester weight gain was defined as 4 kg or less irrespective of pre-gravid nutritional status. IUGR was defined as a birth weight below 2500 g in full-term newborns (LBW-Term), and a birth weight for gestational age and infant sex less than the 10th percentile (SGA-10th) and 2 standard deviations below the mean birth weight (SGA-2SD) based on the international newborn standards from the INTERGROWTH-21 st project. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to determine the independent effect of inadequate weight gain in the third trimester on the risk of IUGR.

   A total of 824 (56.3%) women experienced inadequate weight gain in the third trimester of pregnancy. In this study, 215 (14.7%), 573 (39.2%) and 220 (15.0%) infants were born as LBW-Term, SGA-10th and SGA-2SD, respectively. In the multivariable logistic regression models, compared to adequate weight gain in the third-trimester, the odds ratios (OR) for LBW-Term, SGA-10th and SGA-2SD for inadequate weight gain were 1.8 (95% CI:1.3, 2.5; p < 0.001), 1.4 (95% CI:1.1, 1.8; p = 0.002) and 1.8 (95% CI: 1.3, 2.4; p = 0.001), respectively.
   Conclusions
   Both inadequate third-trimester weight gain and IUGR are prevailing public health concerns in rural Bangladesh. Inadequate weight gain in the third trimester substantially increased the risk of IUGR. Public health programs focusing on the promotion of adequate weight gain in the third trimester of pregnancy with an ultimate aim to decrease IUGR should be implemented.

AB Anemia has been identified as a severe public health concern among young children in India, however, information on the prevalence of anemia attributed to micronutrient deficiencies is lacking. We aimed to assess multiple micronutrient status (iron, zinc, selenium, vitamin A, vitamin D, folate and vitamin B12) in young Indian children and to investigate the role of these seven micronutrients and other non-nutritional factors on hemoglobin concentrations and anemia. One-hundred and twenty children aged 12 to 23 months were included in a cross-sectional nutritional assessment survey, of which 77 children provided a blood sample. Hemoglobin (Hb), serum ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), total body iron, zinc, selenium, retinol binding protein (RBP), folate, vitamin B12 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH) D) were measured, and adjusted for inflammation using C-reactive protein (CRP) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), where appropriate. Predictors for hemoglobin and anemia were identified in multiple regression models. Most of the children were classified as anemic, of which 86 to 93% was associated with iron deficiency depending on the indicator applied. Deficiencies of folate (37%), and notably vitamin D (74%) were also common; fewer children were classified with deficiencies of vitamin B12 (29%), zinc (25%), and vitamin A (17%) and selenium deficiency was nearly absent. Multiple micronutrient deficiencies were common with over half (57%) deficient in three or more micronutrients, and less than 10% of children were classified with adequate status for all the micronutrients measured. Iron status was found to be the only nutritional factor statistically significantly inversely associated with anemia (P = 0.003) in multivariate analysis after controlling for sex. A coordinated multi-micronutrient program is urgently needed to combat the co-existing micronutrient deficiencies in these young children to improve micronutrient status and reduce the high burden of childhood anemia.

TI Prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and associated factors
   among HIV positive educators: Findings from the 2015/6 survey of Health
   of Educators in Public Schools in South Africa
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Introduction
   In many sub-Saharan African countries, confronting the dual epidemic of HIV and NCDs is a public health priority especially in high HIV burden countries such as South Africa. Evidence shows that poor health as a consequence of NCDs and HIV among the workforce increases absenteeism and leads to decrease in productivity. However, the prevalence of these co-occurring chronic conditions and associated factors is unknown in the educator workforce. Improved understanding has implications for their management and wellbeing of educators. This paper reports the prevalence of selected NCDs and associated factors among HIV positive educators in South Africa using the 2015/6 survey of Educators in Public Schools in South Africa.
   Methods
   This was a second-generation surveillance undertaken among educators in selected public schools in all nine provinces in South Africa. A multi-stage stratified cluster design with probability proportional to size sampling was used to draw a random sample of schools. Factors associated with presence of NCDs were determined using a multivariate backward stepwise logistic regression analysis.
   Results
   A total of 1 365 schools were sampled within which 21 495 (85.5%) educators were interviewed. Out of 2691, HIV Positive educators that responded to the questions on NCDs, 36.9% reported having NCDs. The most commonly reported NCDs were high blood pressure (17.4%), and stomach ulcers (13.5%). The increased odds of reporting the presence of NCDs was significantly associated with being female than male [aOR = 1.5: 95% CI (1.1-1.9), p<0.002], age 45 to 54 years [aOR = 1.8: 95% CI (1.4-2.2), p = p<0.001], and age 55 years and older than those 18 to 24 years [aOR = 2.7: 95% CI (1.8-3.9), p<0.001). The decreased odds of reporting the presence of NCDs was significantly associated with not being absent from school for health reasons [aOR = 0.7: 95% CI (0.6-0.9), p = 0.003].
   Conclusion
   NCDs care and active screening should be an integral part of HIV programmes including interventions such as prevention, treatment, care and support amongst public school educators in SA. The education department will need to invest in health promotion intervention programmes to prevent and mitigate the negative impact of NCDs and HIV on the sector.

AB BackgroundRecent advances in sensor technologies have promoted the use of consumer-based accelerometers such as Fitbit Flex in epidemiological and clinical research; however, the validity of the Fitbit Flex in measuring sedentary behavior (SED) and physical activity (PA) has not been fully determined against previously validated research-grade accelerometers such as ActiGraph GT3X+. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the concurrent validity of the Fitbit Flex against ActiGraph GT3X+ in a free-living condition.MethodsA total of 65 participants (age: M=42, SD=14years, female: 72%) each wore a Fitbit Flex and GT3X+ for seven consecutive days. After excluding sleep and non-wear time, time spent (min/day) in SED and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) were estimated using various cut-points for GT3X+ and brand-specific algorithms for Fitbit, respectively. Repeated measures one-way ANOVA and mean absolute percent errors (MAPE) served to examine differences and measurement errors in SED and MVPA estimates between Fitbit Flex and GT3X+, respectively. Pearson and Spearman correlations and Bland-Altman (BA) plots were used to evaluate the association and potential systematic bias between Fitbit Flex and GT3X+. PROC MIXED procedure in SAS was used to examine the equivalence (i.e., the 90% confidence interval with 10% equivalence zone) between the devices.ResultsFitbit Flex produced similar SED and low MAPE (mean difference [MD]=37min/day, P=.21, MAPE=6.8%), but significantly higher MVPA and relatively large MAPE (MD=59-77min/day, P<.0001, MAPE=56.6-74.3%) compared with the estimates from GT3X+ using three different cut-points. The correlations between Fitbit Flex and GT3X+ were consistently higher for SED (r=0.90, =0.86, P<.01), but weaker for MVPA (r=0.65-0.76, =0.69-0.79, P<.01). BA plots revealed that there is no apparent bias in estimating SED.Conclusion In comparison with the GT3X+ accelerometer, the Fitbit Flex provided comparatively accurate estimates of SED, but the Fitbit Flex overestimated MVPA under free-living conditions. Future investigations using the Fitbit Flex should be aware of present findings.

AB Introduction
   Health professionals are to play an essential and effective role in tobacco control. Toombak is a popular form of smokeless tobacco, locally made and used among Sudanese. It is associated with oral and systemic health hazards, particularly oral cancer. This study was set out to assess health professions students' perception of their status as future role models for their patients and the public regarding Toombak use cessation and to explore socio-cognitive covariates of perceived role model status.
   Materials and methods
   A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2013-2014 using a self-administered questionnaire among health professions students enrolled in Medicine, Pharmacy, Dentistry and Nursing colleges in Khartoum state, Sudan. A total of 1530 participants were recruited from colleges using a cluster stratified sampling procedure.
   Results
   The majority of the participants (88.2%) were 19-22 year old, females showed predominance (66.1%). Most of the participants (69.7%) scored good knowledge of Toombak-related therapies. The majority (97%) had a positive attitude towards banning Toombak use in public. Half of the participants (50.4%) confirmed availability of Toombak control policy in their college, while 66% reported receiving training in Toombak cessation. Only 9.2% of the participants reported that they have ever used Toombak; among them, 69.5% were current daily users. Less than half (47.8%) reported a positive perception of their status as a role model. Logistic regression model revealed that tobacco cessation training, availability of college policy and positive attitudes towards banning Toombak use in public were strong predictors of with a positive perception of role model status.
   Conclusion
   Imposing Toombak control policies within colleges combined with formal training in cessation methods, would reinforce the positive perception of health professions students as a role model, particularly the students themselves seem to be ready for such systematic training.

ID DISABILITY
AB Introduction
   To design effective policy and interventions, public health officials must have an accurate and granular picture of the state of multiple chronic conditions (MCC) in their region. The objective of this research is to describe the prevalence and distribution of MCC in New York State.
   Methods
   We performed a secondary data analysis of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from 2011 through 2016 for New York adults (n = 76,186). We analyzed the self-reported prevalence of individuals having 0, 1, 2, or >= 3 chronic conditions by sex, race/ethnicity, age, health insurance type, annual household income, and whether respondents lived in New York City. We also examined the most common condition dyads and triads. Finally, we assessed the prevalence of MCC (2 or more chronic conditions) by county across New York State, and neighborhood within New York City.
   Results
   During 2011-2016, 25.2% of adults in New York State had zero chronic conditions, 24.1% had 1 condition, 18.4% had 2 conditions, and 32.4% had 3 or more. The most prevalent dyad was hypertension and high cholesterol in 17.0% of individuals. The most prevalent triad was hypertension, high cholesterol, and arthritis in 4.5% of individuals. County prevalence of MCC ranged from 42.6% in Westchester County to 66.1% in Oneida County. The prevalence of MCC in New York City neighborhoods ranged from 33.5% in Gramercy Park-Murray Hill to 60.6% in High Bridge-Morrisania.
   Conclusion
   This research contributes to the field's understanding of multiple chronic conditions and allows policy and public health leaders in New York to better understand the prevalence and distribution of MCC.

AB Adolescent depression is a significant public health concern. Although skipping breakfast is associated with depressive symptoms in adolescents, the effects of dietary patterns on their depressive symptoms remain unknown. Therefore, this study aims to determine whether dietary patterns are associated with depressive symptoms among junior and senior high school students in Japan. A total of 441 junior high school students and 417 senior high school students participated in this study. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) was used to measure the participants' depressive symptoms. We surveyed the participants' breakfast consumption pattern, as well as their general dietary patterns (meat, fish, green and yellow vegetables, milk and dairy products, and fruits), using a self-report questionnaire. The results indicated that the senior high school students had a significantly higher CES-D score than the junior high school students. We found negative and significant partial correlations between regular consumption of breakfast and depressive symptoms, and between regular consumption of green and yellow vegetables and depressive symptoms in both junior and senior high school students, after controlling for age, sex, and sleep duration. Furthermore, a one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed that adolescents who consumed green and yellow vegetables every day (one or more times per day) had significantly lower depressive symptoms than those from the "Never/1-2 times a week" group. The findings of this study reveal that the regular consumption of green and yellow vegetables is associated with lower depressive symptoms in adolescents, that is, the consumption of green and yellow vegetables may be vital in the context of adolescents' mental health.

AB BackgroundGenes involved in production of secondary metabolites (SMs) in fungi are exceptionally diverse. Even strains of the same species may exhibit differences in metabolite production, a finding that has important implications for drug discovery. Unlike in other eukaryotes, genes producing SMs are often clustered and co-expressed in fungal genomes, but the genetic mechanisms involved in the creation and maintenance of these secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (SMBGCs) remains poorly understood.ResultsIn order to address the role of genome architecture and chromosome scale structural variation in generating diversity of SMBGCs, we generated chromosome scale assemblies of six geographically diverse isolates of the insect pathogenic fungus Tolypocladium inflatum, producer of the multi-billion dollar lifesaving immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin, and utilized a Hi-C chromosome conformation capture approach to address the role of genome architecture and structural variation in generating intraspecific diversity in SMBGCs. Our results demonstrate that the exchange of DNA between heterologous chromosomes plays an important role in generating novelty in SMBGCs in fungi. In particular, we demonstrate movement of a polyketide synthase (PKS) and several adjacent genes by translocation to a new chromosome and genomic context, potentially generating a novel PKS cluster. We also provide evidence for inter-chromosomal recombination between nonribosomal peptide synthetases located within subtelomeres and uncover a polymorphic cluster present in only two strains that is closely related to the cluster responsible for biosynthesis of the mycotoxin aflatoxin (AF), a highly carcinogenic compound that is a major public health concern worldwide. In contrast, the cyclosporin cluster, located internally on chromosomes, was conserved across strains, suggesting selective maintenance of this important virulence factor for infection of insects.ConclusionsThis research places the evolution of SMBGCs within the context of whole genome evolution and suggests a role for recombination between chromosomes in generating novel SMBGCs in the medicinal fungus Tolypocladium inflatum.

AB BackgroundWe sought to determine whether the Reflective Practice Questionnaire (RPQ) is a reliable measure of reflective capacity and related characteristics in medical students. We also planned to learn how the RPQ could be used in medical education.MethodsThe RPQ is a 40 item self-report questionnaire that includes a multi-faceted approach to measuring reflective capacity. It also includes sub-scales on several other theoretically relevant constructs such as desire for improvement, confidence, stress, and job satisfaction. The reliabilities of reflective capacity and other sub-scales were determined by calculating their Cronbach alpha reliability values. In the present study, the RPQ was answered by 98 graduating fourth-year medical students from an American University, and these RPQ scores were compared with general public and mental health practitioner samples from a prior study using ANOVA and Bonferroni adjusted comparisons.ResultsMedical students reported a higher reflective capacity than the general public sample, but students were statistically indistinguishable from the mental health practitioner sample. For medical students, reflective capacity was associated with features of confidence, stress, and desire for improvement. Job satisfaction was positively associated with confidence in communication with patients, and negatively associated with stress when interacting with patients. A cluster analysis revealed that around 19% of the medical students exhibited a relatively high level of anxiety interacting with patients, 23% were less engaged, 5% were dissatisfied, and 7% expressed a level of over-confidence in their knowledge and skills that was concerning.ConclusionsThe RPQ is a reliable measure of reflective capacity (Chronbach's alpha value=0.84) and related characteristics (Cronbach's alpha values from 0.75 to 0.83) in medical students. The RPQ can be used as part of pre-post evaluations of medical education initiatives, to complement student self-reflection activities in the curriculum, and to identify students who might benefit from targeted intervention.

AB BackgroundLittle is known about operative volume, distribution of cases, or capacity of the public sector to deliver essential surgical services in Uganda.MethodsA standardized mixed-methods surgical assessment and retrospective operative logbook review were completed at 16 randomly selected public hospitals serving 640% of Uganda's population.ResultsA total of 3014 operations were recorded, annualizing to a surgical volume of 36,670 cases/year or 1445 operations/100,000people/year. Absolute surgical volume was greater at regional referral than general hospitals (p<0001); but, relative surgical volume/catchment population was greater at the general versus regional level (p=003). Most patients undergoing operations were women (783%) with a mean age of 269years. The overall case distribution was 690% obstetrics/gynecology, 237% general surgery, 40% orthopedics, and 33% other subspecialties. Cesarean sections were the most common operation (558%). Monthly operative volume was strongly predicted by number of surgical, anesthetic, and obstetric physician providers (?=1072, p=0005, R-2=094) when controlling for confounders. Notably, operative volume was not correlated with availability of electricity, oxygen, light source, suction, blood, instruments, suture, gloves, intravenous fluid, or antibiotics.ConclusionAn understanding of operative case volume and distribution is essential in facilitating targeted interventions to strengthen surgical capacity. These data suggest that surgical workforce is the critical driver of operative volume in the Ugandan public sector. Investment in the surgical workforce is imperative to ensure access to safe, timely, and affordable surgical and anaesthesia care.

DE Renouncing care; Health inequalities; Health system use; French Guiana;

ID RISK-FACTORS; INEQUALITIES; DETERMINANTS
AB BackgroundIn French Guiana, health inequalities are patent for a broad range of pathologies for all age groups. The objective of the present study was to quantify the proportion of the population that had renounced care in the past year, to study predictive factors, and to compare results with other French territories.MethodsA two-stage random sample of 2015 individuals aged 15 to 75years was surveyed by telephone. A descriptive analysis of variables relative to renouncing care, use of health care, screening, and vaccination was initially performed. Multivariate analysis was then used to determine variables associated with renouncing care for financial reasons and renouncing for reasons linked to time were directly estimated using a Poisson model on weighted data. Variables with a significance level<0.2 in the bivariate analysis were included in the full multivariate model.ResultsIn French Guiana, during the past 12months, 30.9% of surveyed persons renounced care whatever the type for financial reasons. Results of the multivariate analysis showed that gender, perceived financial situation, perceived health and complementary insurance status were independent predictive factors of care renouncement for financial reasons. Overall, 24% of the surveyed population declared having renounced to care for time-related motives. The independent predictors for time-related renouncing were different than those for renouncing care for financial reasons: a higher education level and a poor perceived health were independently associated with time-related renouncement; retired persons and students were found to renounce care less frequently than persons with a job.ConclusionsRenouncing for financial reasons, a major target of the 2016 health law, represented a public health problem in French Guiana. Renouncing for lack of time was an important motive for renouncing, which is aggravated by the insufficient number of health professionals, but may benefit from organizational solutions. There are avenues for improvement of health for the most vulnerable: promote health, act on risk factors, and facilitate the readability and accessibility of the health system. Recent reforms to stabilize health insurance may however have some adverse consequences for migrants.

ID SEXUALLY-TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS; PREGNANCY; OUTCOMES
AB BackgroundSyphilis screening can be successfully integrated into antenatal clinics, and potentially avert significant morbidity and mortality to unborn infants. A minority of male partners report for testing and treatment, increasing the likelihood of reinfection. We conducted a qualitative study to understand factors influencing male partners to seek treatment after syphilis notification by their pregnant partners.MethodsA purposeful sample of 54 adults who participated in the STOP (Syphilis Treatment of Partners) study was stratified by gender (24 women, 30 male partners) and enrolled for in-depth interviews which were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using the thematic approach.ResultsThe participants' median age (IQR) was 32years (25-44), 87% were married, and 57.4% (31/74) had attained secondary education. Fourteen of 22 (63%) female participants reported that they sometimes experienced domestic violence. Male participant's knowledge of syphilis and their perception of their valued role as responsible fathers of an unborn baby facilitated return. Female's fear of partners violence and poor communication between partners, were barriers against delivery of the notification forms to partners and subsequent treatment of partners. For men, fear of injection pain, perceptions of syphilis as a genetic disease and as a woman's problem, busy work schedules, poor access to good STD services, shared facilities with women in clinics, as well as HIV-related stigma were important barrier factors.ConclusionsThe return to the clinic for treatment of male partners after partner notification by infected pregnant women, was low due to limited knowledge about syphilis, fear of painful injection, fears of domestic violence, lack of communication skills (individual characteristics) and syphilis disease characteristics such as signs and symptoms. This, combined with health services characteristics such as structural barriers that hinder male partner treatment, low access, low capacity, work/time challenges, inadequate laboratory services and low clinic personnel capacity; threatens efforts to eliminate mother-to-child infection of syphilis. Improved public messaging about syphilis, better services, legal and policy frameworks supporting STD notification and treatment in resource-constrained settings are needed for effective STD control.Trial registrationClinicaltrials.govNCT02262390., Date Registered October 8 2014.

AB BackgroundIn the spring of 1918, the War to End All Wars, which would ultimately claim more than 37 million lives, had entered into its final year and would change the global political and economic landscape forever. At the same time, a new global threat was emerging and would become one of the most devastating global health crises in recorded history.Main textThe 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus spread across Europe, North America, and Asia over a 12-month period resulting in an estimated 500 million infections and 50-100 million deaths worldwide, of which similar to 50% of these occurred within the fall of 1918 (Emerg Infect Dis 12:15-22, 2006, Bull Hist Med 76:105-115, 2002). However, the molecular factors that contributed to the emergence of, and subsequent public health catastrophe associated with, the 1918 pandemic virus remained largely unknown until 2005, when the characterization of the reconstructed pandemic virus was announced heralding a new era of advanced molecular investigations (Science 310:77-80, 2005). In the century following the emergence of the 1918 pandemic virus we have landed on the Moon, developed the electronic computer (and a global internet), and have eradicated smallpox. In contrast, we have a largely remedial knowledge and understanding of one of the greatest scourges in recorded history.ConclusionHere, we reflect on the 1918 influenza pandemic, including its emergence and subsequent rapid global spread. In addition, we discuss the pathophysiology associated with the 1918 virus and its predilection for the young and healthy, the rise of influenza therapeutic research following the pandemic, and, finally, our level of preparedness for future pandemics.

AB BackgroundMore than 50% of the people are infected worldwide with H. pylori which causes significant public health morbidity and mortality. The distribution is quite different from country to country. Hence, early information is very important to prevent upper gastrointestinal complications. The current study aimed to assess the magnitude of H. pylori and associated risk factors among symptomatic patients attending at Jasmin internal medicine and pediatrics specialized private clinic from August 2017 until May 2018 in Addis Ababa city, Ethiopia.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted among 487 patients with upper gastrointestinal tract complaints attending at Jasmin internal medicine and pediatrics specialized private clinic from August 2017 until May 2018. Convenient sampling technique was used to enroll participants. Information regarding to risk factors was assessed using structured questionnaire. Stool samples were collected for H. pylori antigen test. Data was entered and analyzed using SPSS version20 statistical software and a p-value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.ResultsThe overall prevalence of H. pylori among participants using stool antigen was 36.8% (n=179/487). Regarding to family income status, those who have low monthly income were more likely to be infected with H. pylori infection (AOR=6.056, CI 95%=1.603-22.881, P=0.037). In addition, families with low educational level were more likely to be infected with H. pylori infection than higher level education (AOR=4.150, CI95%=1.059-16.270, P=0.041). Number of family members in the house-hold, type of toilet they used and source of drinking water were not significantly associated with H. pylori infection.ConclusionsThe prevalence of H. pylori infection was 36.8% and it was related to low income and low education levels. This finding calls for improving the socioeconomic status of the community. Moreover, further studies are needed to investigate potential risk factors for H. pylori infection.

AB Antimicrobial resistance continues to outpace the development of new chemotherapeutics. Novel pathogens continue to evolve and emerge. Public health innovation has the potential to open a new front in the war of our wits against their genes (Joshua Lederberg). Dense sampling coupled to next generation sequencing can increase the spatial and temporal resolution of microbial characterization while sensor technologies precisely map physical parameters relevant to microbial survival and spread. Microbial, physical, and epidemiological big data could be combined to improve prospective risk identification. However, applied in the wrong way, these approaches may not realize their maximum potential benefits and could even do harm. Minimizing microbial-human interactions would be a mistake. There is evidence that microbes previously thought of at best benign may actually enhance human health. Benign and health-promoting microbiomes may, or may not, spread via mechanisms similar to pathogens. Infectious vaccines are approaching readiness to make enhanced contributions to herd immunity. The rigorously defined nature of infectious vaccines contrasts with indigenous benign or health-promoting microbiomes but they may converge. A microbial Neolithic revolution is a possible future in which human microbial-associations are understood and managed analogously to the macro-agriculture of plants and animals. Tradeoffs need to be framed in order to understand health-promoting potentials of benign, and/or health-promoting microbiomes and infectious vaccines while also discouraging pathogens. Super-spreaders are currently defined as individuals who play an outsized role in the contagion of infectious disease. A key unanswered question is whether the super-spreader concept may apply similarly to health-promoting microbes. The complex interactions of individual rights, community health, pathogen contagion, the spread of benign, and of health-promoting microbiomes including infectious vaccines require study. Advancing the detailed understanding of heterogeneity in microbial spread is very likely to yield important insights relevant to public health.

AB BackgroundPerinatal mental health problems such as mood disorders are common. We propose a new multidisciplinary health service intervention program providing continuous support to women and their children from the start of pregnancy till after childbirth. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of the program with respect to making women's mental health better in the postpartum period and improving the state of care for women and their children in the perinatal period.MethodsWe performed a controlled study to investigate the effectiveness of the program in Suzaka City, Japan. The women's mental health status was assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) 3months postpartum. Of 349 women, 210 were allocated to the intervention group and 139 to the control group. From April 2014 to March 2015, the number of the pregnant women who were followed-up by the multidisciplinary meeting in the intervention and control groups were 60 and 4, respectively. In the same period, the number of the pregnant women who were identified as requiring intensive care were 21 and 2, respectively.ResultsThe total EPDS score, which was the primary outcome of the present study, differed significantly between the intervention and control groups (Mean [SD] = 2.74 (2.89) and 4.58 [2.62], respectively; p<0.001). The number of the women receiving counseling from a public health nurse (5.3% in intervention group, 0.7% in control group, p=0.02), attending maternal seminars (attendant ratio: 46% whereas 16%, p=0.01), and receiving home visits by public health nurses (home visit ratio: 93.8% whereas 82.6%, p<0.001) was significantly higher in the intervention group compared to the control group.ConclusionsThe present study indicates that continuum support provided by integrated mental health care through a multidisciplinary maternal and child health service in the community can make women's mental health better in the postpartum period and help women and their children receive more health services from public health nurses.Trial registrationName of registry: Research for the effectiveness of a multi-professional health service intervention program of continuum supports for mother and child which starts for pregnancy periods to enhance maternal mental health.UMIN Clinical Trials Registry number: UMIN000032424.Registration date: April 29th, 2018.Registration timing: retrospective.

TI Promoting vaccination in the province of Quebec: the PromoVaQ randomized
   controlled trial protocol
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Motivational interviewing; Vaccination coverage; RCT; Province of Quebec
ID VACCINES; RISK
AB BackgroundVaccination has a huge public health impact. Maintaining vaccine coverage is key to avoid the devastating consequences of resurgence. In the Province of Quebec, vaccine coverage in young children are sub-optimal, mostly due to ambivalence toward vaccine safety and efficacy. We previously conducted a regional study in the Quebec's Eastern Townships region, the PromoVac Study, to test a new educational intervention, based on motivational interviewing techniques, aimed at promoting infant vaccination. This first study evidenced that the intervention led to a marked increase in mothers' intention to vaccinate, and vaccine coverage in their infants. The current study protocol aims at scaling up these results at a provincial level using a randomized controlled trial design.MethodsThis pragmatic, randomized, controlled, parallel-group clinical trial will compare the effectiveness of the motivational interviewing to an educational intervention, including the distribution of an information flyer as standard of care on vaccination coverage in four maternity wards across the Province of Quebec (PromovaQ). Adult mothers of children born in participating maternity wards were recruited between March 2014 and February 2015. Vaccination coverage will be assessed at 3-years of age, thus the trial is expected to be completed in March 2019. Statistical analyses will be conducted under the intention-to-treat principle. Vaccine coverage will be analyzed using Chi-squared distribution testing and logistic regression to identify determinant factors. Secondary outcomes will include vaccine hesitation and intention scores, mother's knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about immunization, and psychosocial determinants of intention to vaccinate.DiscussionIn the case results of this Provincial RCT be confirmed, serious consideration should then be given by Ministry of Health authorities to the possible implementation of MI-based strategies across provincial maternity wards. To ensure adequate input and secure implementation, study design and results will be reviewed with relevant stakeholders, including the children's families, and provincial and regional decision-makers. Results will be adapted and shared with all stakeholders.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT02666872 (Retrospectively registered as January 28, 2016).

AB BackgroundThe significance of sanitation to safeguard human health is irrefutable and has important public health dimensions. Access to sanitation has been essential for human dignity, health and well-being. Despite 15years of conjunctive efforts under the global action plans like Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), 2.3 billion people have no access to improved sanitation facilities (flush latrine or pit latrine) and nearly 892 million of the total world's population is still practicing open defecation.MethodsThe study provides a systematic review of the published literature related to implications of open defecation that goes beyond the scope of addressing health outcomes by also investigating social outcomes associated with open defecation. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was used to frame the review, empirical studies focusing upon open defecation in women aged 13-50 in low and middle income countries were included in the review. Research papers included in the review were assessed for quality using appropriate critical appraisal tools. In total 9 articles were included in the review; 5 of these related to health effects and 4 related to social effects of open defecation.ResultsThe review identified 4 overarching themes; Health Impacts of open defecation, Increased risk of sexual exploitation, Threat to women's privacy and dignity and Psychosocial stressors linked to open defecation, which clearly present a serious situation of poor sanitation in rural communities of Lower-Middle Income Countries (LMICs). The findings of the review identified that open defecation promotes poor health in women with long-term negative effects on their psychosocial well-being, however it is a poorly researched topic.ConclusionThe health and social needs of women and girls remain largely unmet and often side-lined in circumstances where toilets in homes are not available. Further research is critically required to comprehend the generalizability of effects of open defecation on girls and women.Prospero registrationCRD42019119946. Registered 9 January 2019 .

AB Background
   Leprosy remains a disease of concern in many countries including Nepal. To achieve the target of elimination, the WHO strategy promotes comprehensive education of patients, healthcare workers (HCWs), and the public on leprosy-related issues. However most educational programs are based on the concerns of HCWs and not on patients' needs. The objective of this paper is to explore the educational needs of leprosy affected patients in Nepal and compare them to the needs perceived by HCWs.
   Methodology/principal findings
   Semi directive interviews were conducted with patients and HCWs. The data was analyzed using the basic interpretative qualitative framework. The study was conducted in two leprosy referral centers, one university hospital and one primary health care center: Lalgadh Leprosy Hospital and Services Centre, Anandaban Hospital and its satellite clinic in Patan, B. P. Koirala Institute of Health Sciences in Dharan, and the Itahari primary health care centre.
   The results show that there remains a lack of knowledge regarding the disease (origins, manifestations, prevention and treatment) contributing to late care seeking behavior and high levels of stigma, with an important psychological and financial stress for patients. All of the HCWs displayed a good understanding of patients' difficulties and needs and acknowledged the key role of patient education. However, they expressed several challenges in managing patients due to lack of time, human resources and training in patient education.
   Conclusions/significance
   Further efforts need to be made to increase patients' general knowledge of the disease in order to motivate them to seek healthcare earlier and change their perception of the disease to reduce stigma. HCWs need proper training in patient education and counseling for them to acquire the necessary skills required to address the different educational needs of their patients. The use of lay and peer counselors would be an option to address the workload and lack of time expressed by HCWs.

AB Background
   In June 2016, the Republic of Korea included free human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccinations for all 12-year-old girls in its national immunization program.
   Purpose
   This study investigated perceptions of nurses on HPV vaccination and their intent to vaccinate preteens at the best ages.
   Methods
   Recruited for the survey were 514 health teachers (181, 35.2%), public health nurses (168, 32.7%), and clinical nurses (165, 32.1%). Factor-analysis was conducted to validate the Vaccine-Hesitancy Scale for Korean nurses. Related variables associated with vaccine-acceptance were examined using the Kruskal-Wallis test and Spearman's rho coefficients, due to lack of normalization.
   Results
   Factor-analysis results showed that two factors of positive acceptance (7 items) and negative acceptance (3 items) accounted for 67.46% of the total variance, and explained 47.4% and 20.1%, respectively. Nurses who positively accepted HPV vaccine differed significantly in agreement to vaccinate girls or boys. For the proper vaccination age, a significant difference emerged between answers for girls and vaccine-acceptance scores, whereas no difference emerged between answers for boys and the scores. The vaccinated status of respondents significantly related to higher HPV vaccine acceptance, although age, religion, marital status, education, and working duration did not.
   Conclusions
   This study showed that vaccine-acceptance levels reflect nurses' attitudes and opinions about HPV vaccination for girls and boys.

AB Objectives
   The objective was to identify the systematic associations among chronic diseases and drugs in the form of patterns and to describe and clinically interpret the constituted patterns with a focus on exploring the existence of potential drug-drug and drug-disease interactions and prescribing cascades.
   Methods
   This observational, cross-sectional study used the demographic and clinical information from electronic medical databases and the pharmacy billing records of all users of the public health system of the Spanish region of Aragon in 2015. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted based on the tetra-choric correlations among the diagnoses of chronic diseases and the dispensed drugs in 887,572 patients aged. 65 years. The analysis was stratified by age and sex. To name the constituted patterns, assess their clinical nature, and identify potential interactions among diseases and drugs, the associations found in each pattern were independently reviewed by two pharmacists and two doctors and tested against the literature and the information reported in the technical medicinal forms.
   Results
   Six multimorbidity-polypharmacy patterns were found in this large-scale population study, named as respiratory, mental health, cardiometabolic, endocrinological, osteometabolic, and mechanical-pain. The nature of the patterns in terms of diseases and drugs differed by sex and age and became more complex as age advanced.
   Conclusions
   The six clinically sound multimorbidity-polypharmacy patterns described in this non-elderly population confirmed the existence of systematic associations among chronic diseases and medications, and revealed some unexpected associations suggesting the prescribing cascade phenomenon as a potential underlying factor. These findings may help to broaden the focus and orient the early identification of potential interactions when caring for multimorbid patients at high risk of adverse health outcomes due to polypharmacy.

TI Regional disparities in maternal and child health indicators: Cluster
   analysis of districts in Bangladesh
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Efforts to mitigate public health concerns are showing encouraging results over the time but disparities across the geographic regions still exist within countries. Inadequate researches on the regional disparities of health indicators based on representative and comparable data create challenges to develop evidence-based health policies, planning and future studies in developing countries like Bangladesh. This study examined the disparities among districts on various maternal and child health indicators in Bangladesh. Cluster analysis-an unsupervised learning technique was used based on nationally representative dataset originated from Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), 2012-13. According to our results, Bangladesh is classified into two clusters based on different health indicators with substantial variations in districts per clusters for different sets of indicators suggesting regional variation across the indicators. There is a need to differentially focus on community-level interventions aimed at increasing maternal and child health care utilization and improving the socioeconomic position of mothers, especially in disadvantaged regions. The cluster analysis approach is unique in terms of the use of health care metrics in a multivariate setup to study regional similarity and dissimilarity in the context of Bangladesh.

AB BackgroundIn Senegal in 2015, an estimated 4800 children were living with HIV, with 1200 receiving ARV treatment, of whom half had follow-up care in decentralized sites outside Dakar.However, until now no studies have determined the efficacy of pediatric treatment in decentralized settings, even though the emergence of viral resistance, particularly among children in Africa, is a well-known phenomenon. This study aimed to assess the virological status of HIV-infected children in all decentralized facilities to help improve access to quality care.MethodsA cross-sectional epidemiological and virological study was conducted in all of Senegal's regions, except Dakar, between March and June 2015 and sought to include all HIV-infected children and adolescents (0-19years), treated or not with ARVs.Socio-demographic and clinical data and a blood sample on blotting paper were collected for children from treatment sites. Samples were routed on public transportation, assisted by a network of community health workers. A viral load (VL) assay was performed for each child, followed by genotyping when it exceeded 1000 copies/mL (3 log(10)).ResultsOf the 851 identified children, 666 (78%) were enrolled in the study. Half of the children were girls, and the average age was 8years (6months-19years). Most of the children (96.7%) were infected with HIV-1, and 90% were treated with ART, primarily with AZT+3TC+NVP/EFV therapeutic regimen. The median duration of time on ART was 21months (1-129). VL was measured for 2% of children before this study. Almost two-thirds (64%) of the children are experiencing virological failure. Among them, there was resistance to at least one drug for 86.5% of cases. Also, 25% children presented resistance to one drug and 40% to two out of three. For nearly one-third of the children presenting resistance, none of the three drugs of the treatment was active. Factors associated with virological failure were male sex, follow-up by a generalist rather than a specialist, and treatment interruptions.ConclusionsWe observed a high level of virological failure and a high percentage of viral resistance among children receiving health care in decentralized facilities in Senegal.

AB Leishmaniasis encompasses a group of diverse clinical diseases caused by protozoan parasites of the Leishmania genus. This disease is a major public health problem in the New World affecting people exposed in endemic regions. The city of Governador Valadares (Minas Gerais/Brazil) is a re-emerging area for visceral leishmaniasis, with 191 human cases reported from 2008 to 2017 and a lethality rate of 14.7%. The transmission of the parasite occurs intensely in this region with up to 22% of domestic dogs with positive serology for the visceral form. Lu. longipalpis is one of the most abundant sand fly species in this area. Despite this scenario, so far there is no information regarding the circulating Leishmania species in the insect vector Lutzomyia longipalpis in this focus. We collected 616 female Lutzomyia longipalpis sand flies between January and September 2015 in the Vila Parque Ibituruna neighborhood (Governador Valadares/MG), which is located on a transitional area between the sylvatic and urban environments with residences built near a preserved area. After DNA extraction of individual sand flies, the natural Leishmania infections in Lu. longipalpis were detected by conventional PCR, using primers derived from kDNA sequences, specific for L. (Leishmania) or L. (Viannia) subgenus. The sensitivity of these PCR reactions was 0.1 pg of DNA for each Leishmania subgenus and the total infection rate of 16.2% (100 positive specimens). Species-specific PCR detected the presence of multiple Leishmania species in infected Lu. longipalpis specimens in Governador Valadares, including L. amazonensis (n = 3), L. infantum (n = 28), L. (Viannia) spp. (n = 20), coinfections with L. infantum and L. (Viannia) spp. (n = 5), and L. (Leishmania) spp (n = 44). Our results demonstrate that multiple Leishmania species circulate in Lu. longipalpis in Governador Valadares and reveal a potential increasing risk of transmission of the different circulating parasite species. This information reinforces the need for epidemiological and entomological surveillance in this endemic focus, and the development of effective control strategies against leishmaniasis.

AB BackgroundMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is endemic in dromedary camels in the Arabian Peninsula, and zoonotic transmission to people is a sporadic event. In the absence of epidemiological data on the reservoir species, patterns of zoonotic transmission have largely been approximated from primary human cases. This study aimed to identify meteorological factors that may increase the risk of primary MERS infections in humans.MethodsA case-crossover design was used to identify associations between primary MERS cases and preceding weather conditions within the 2-week incubation period in Saudi Arabia using univariable conditional logistic regression. Cases with symptom onset between January 2015 - December 2017 were obtained from a publicly available line list of human MERS cases maintained by the World Health Organization. The complete case dataset (N=1191) was reduced to approximate the cases most likely to represent spillover transmission from camels (N=446). Data from meteorological stations closest to the largest city in each province were used to calculate the daily mean, minimum, and maximum temperature (C), relative humidity (%), wind speed (m/s), and visibility (m). Weather variables were categorized according to strata; temperature and humidity into tertiles, and visibility and wind speed into halves.ResultsLowest temperature (Odds Ratio=1.27; 95% Confidence Interval=1.04-1.56) and humidity (OR=1.35; 95% CI=1.10-1.65) were associated with increased cases 8-10days later. High visibility was associated with an increased number of cases 7days later (OR=1.26; 95% CI=1.01-1.57), while wind speed also showed statistically significant associations with cases 5-6days later.ConclusionsResults suggest that primary MERS human cases in Saudi Arabia are more likely to occur when conditions are relatively cold and dry. This is similar to seasonal patterns that have been described for other respiratory diseases in temperate climates. It was hypothesized that low visibility would be positively associated with primary cases of MERS, however the opposite relationship was seen. This may reflect behavioural changes in different weather conditions. This analysis provides key initial evidence of an environmental component contributing to the development of primary MERS-CoV infections.

AB BackgroundCrowdsourcing method is an excellent tool for developing tailored interventions to improve sexual health. We evaluated the implementation of an innovation contest for sexual health promotion in China.MethodsWe organized an innovation contest over three months in 2014 for Chinese individuals <30years old to submit images for a sexual health promotion campaign. We solicited entries via social media and in-person events. The winning entry was adapted into a poster and distributed to STD clinics across Guangdong Province. In this study, we evaluated factors associated with images that received higher scores, described the themes of the top five finalists, and evaluated the acceptability of the winning entry using an online survey tool.ResultsWe received 96 image submissions from 76 participants in 10 Chinese provinces. Most participants were youth (<25years, 85%) and non-professionals (without expertise in medicine, public health, or media, 88%). Youth were more likely to submit high-scoring entries. Images from professionals in medicine, public health, or media did not have higher scores compared to images from non-professionals. Participants were twice as likely to have learned about the contest through in-person events compared to social media. We adapted and distributed the winning entry to 300 STD clinics in 22 cities over 2weeks. A total of 8338 people responded to an acceptability survey of the finalist entry. Among them, 79.8% endorsed or strongly endorsed being more willing to undergo STD testing after seeing the poster.ConclusionsInnovation contests may be useful for soliciting images as a part of comprehensive sexual health campaigns in low- and middle-income countries.

AB BackgroundIn the last few years, pertussis has re-emerged worldwide. The aim of this article is to study how the incidence of the disease has evolved in Barcelona city over a 16-year period, and determine which factors are associated with the evolution of the disease. We discuss the causes of the observed changes considering different possibilities such as vaccination coverage, vaccine effectiveness, increased surveillance or the effect of the current economic recession.MethodsWe performed a cross-sectional, observational, population-based descriptive study using data for the 2000-2015 period from the notifiable diseases register maintained by Barcelona Public Health Agency. We used Poisson regression to compute adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI).ResultsA total of 1791 cases were registered. The incidence of the disease increased throughout the city from 2011 onwards. While children under 1year of age had the highest-incidence and were the most at risk (aOR=27.18, CI:23.51-31.44), we found that the age of affected children was higher in the last years. Incidence proportion (PRR) was lower among foreign-born children than native children (PRR=0.43 CI:0.32-0.58). In the whole-cell vaccine period (2000-2004), the percentage of cases under 1year of age who received the vaccine was lower than in 2005-2015 when the acellular vaccine was used (p=0.01), suggesting a lower efficacy of the acellular vaccine. However, vaccination coverage in children under 6years remained high (90%), and there were no significant year-to-year variations (p=0.757). Moreover, there did not appear to be any significant restrictions in medical care. According to the index of disposable household income (DHI), pertussis incidence increased from 2011 onwards in all neighbourhoods and remained higher in those with lower DHI.ConclusionsThe noteworthy increase in pertussis incidence does not seem to be due to the economic recession, but to other factors here described.

AB A high quality systematic review search has three core attributes; it is systematic, comprehensive, and transparent. The current over-emphasis on the primacy of systematic reviews over other forms of literature review in health research, however, runs the risk of encouraging publication of reviews whose searches do not meet these three criteria under the guise of being systematic reviews. This correspondence comes in response to Perman S, Turner S, Ramsay AIG, Baim-Lance A, Utley M, Fulop NJ. School-based vaccination programmes: a systematic review of the evidence on organization and delivery in high income countries. 2017; BMC Public Health 17:252, which we assert did not meet these three important quality criteria for systematic reviews, thereby leading to potentially unreliable conclusions. Our aims herein are to emphasize the importance of maintaining a high degree of rigour in the conduct and publication of systematic reviews that may be used by clinicians and policy-makers to guide or alter practice or policy, and to highlight and discuss key evidence omitted in the published review in order to contextualize the findings for readers. By consulting a research librarian, we identified limitations in the search terms, the number and type of databases, and the screening methods used by Perman et al. Using a revised Ovid MEDLINE search strategy, we identified an additional 1016 records in that source alone, and highlighted relevant literature on the organization and delivery of school-based immunization program that was omitted as a result. We argue that a number of the literature gaps noted by Perman et al. may well be addressed by existing literature found through a more systematic and comprehensive search and screening strategy. We commend both the journal and the authors, however, for their transparency in supplying information about the search strategy and providing open access to peer reviewer and editor's comments, which enabled us to understand the reasons for the limitations of that review.

AB BackgroundGestational diabetes increases risk for type 2 diabetes seven-fold, creating a large public health burden in a young population. In the US, there are no large registries for tracking postpartum diabetes screening among women in under-resourced communities who face challenges with access to care after pregnancy. Existing data from Medicaid claims is limited as women often lose this coverage within months of delivery. In this study, we aim to leverage data from electronic health records and administrative claims to better assess postpartum diabetes screening rates among low income women.MethodsA retrospective population of 1078 women with gestational diabetes who delivered between 1/1/2010 and 10/8/2015 was generated by linking electronic health record data from 21 Missouri Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) with Medicaid administrative claims. Screening rates for diabetes were calculated within 12weeks and 1 year of delivery. Initial screening after the first postpartum year was also documented.ResultsMedian age in the final population was 28 (IQR 24-33) years with over-representation of black non-Hispanic and urban women. In the final population, 9.7% of women had a recommended diabetes screening test within 12weeks and 18.9% were screened within 1 year of delivery. An additional 125 women received recommended screening for the first time beyond 1 year postpartum. The percentage of women who had a postpartum visit (83.9%) and any glucose testing (40.6%) in the first year far exceeded the proportion of women with recommended screening tests.ConclusionsLinking electronic health record and administrative claims data provides a more complete picture of healthcare follow-up among low income women after gestational diabetes. While screening rates are higher than reported with claims data alone, there are opportunities to improve adherence to screening guidelines in this population.

AB BackgroundSedentary behaviour (SB) in childhood is a major public health concern. Little is known about ethnic differences in SB during school and holiday weeks among White British (WB) and South Asian (SA) children, which this study aims to address through investigating inclinometer measured SB and exploring reasons for child engagement in SB.MethodsA mixed methods study, comprising of a quantitative investigation with 160, 6-8years old children and a qualitative study with a subsample of 18 children, six parents and eight teachers was undertaken. Children of WB and SA ethnicity in three schools were invited to wear inclinometers for seven school terms (summer/winter/spring) and seven holidays (winter/spring) days during July 2016-May 2017. Total SB, SB accumulated in bouts >30min and breaks in SB were explored using multivariate linear mixed effects models which adjusted for wear time, sex, deprivation, overweight status, season, term, weekday and school.Nine focus groups and two interviews were carried out using the Theoretical Domains Framework to explore SB perceptions among parents, teachers and children. Data were analysed using the Framework Approach.Results104/160 children provided 836 valid days of data. Children spent on average eight hours of SB/day during term time and holidays, equating to 60% of their awake time, and had on average 111 SB breaks /day. SA children had 25 fewer SB breaks/ day when compared to WB (p<0.001). Perceived reasons for engagement in SB included: boredom, enjoyment of screen activities (by children), parenting practices, curriculum pressures (by teachers), the need to sit down and learn, and child's preference for screen activities (by parents).ConclusionsChildren spent 60% of their awake time being sedentary, regardless of ethnicity or school term. There were no significant ethnic differences for any of the SB outcomes except for breaks in SB. Interventions aimed at reducing SB should consider involving parents and teachers and should focus on increasing breaks in SB, especially for SA children, who are at a higher risk of cardio metabolic ill health.

TI Work stress among older employees in Germany: Effects on health and
   retirement age
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID EFFORT-REWARD IMBALANCE; RISK-FACTOR; JOB STRAIN; DEPRESSION; SYMPTOMS;
   EUROPE; SCALE; EXIT
AB Background
   Policy makers in aging societies aim for the extension of work lives by increasing the official retirement age. Despite these efforts, many people stop working before reaching this retirement age. The main reason for early retirement is poor health. Health in turn is influenced by exposure to the work environment. Furthermore, health and work stress are influenced by education, which may lead to different effects for the lowly and the highly educated.
   Objective
   This study examines the relationship between work stress and retirement age. It investigates whether this relationship is mediated by health and moderated by education. Three dimensions of health are taken into account: self-rated health (SRH), depressive symptoms, and high cardiovascular risk diseases (HCVR).
   Methods
   A German subsample of the longitudinal Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) was linked with register data of the German Public Pension Scheme (SHARE-RV). The sample followed 302 individuals aged 50 to 65 years at baseline from 2004 to 2014. The data contains information on work stress, measured by job control and effort-reward-imbalance (ERI), health, and age of retirement. Multi-group structural equation modeling was applied to analyze the direct and indirect effects of work stress on retirement age via health. Work stress was lagged so that it temporally preceded health and retirement age.
   Results
   Lower job control and poorer SRH lead to a lower retirement age. Health does not operate as a mediator in the relationship between work stress and retirement age. Education moderates the relationship between work stress and health: high ERI leads to better SRH and better physical health of higher educated persons. Low job control increases the risk of depressive symptoms for persons with less education.
   Conclusions
   Improving stressful working conditions, particularly improving job control, can prolong the working lives of employees and postpone retirement.

AB BackgroundClusters of under-vaccinated children are emerging in a number of states in the United States due to rising rates of vaccine hesitancy and refusal. As the measles outbreaks in California and other states in 2015 and in Minnesota in 2017 showed, such clusters can pose a significant public health risk. Prior methods have used publicly-available school immunization data for analysis (except for a few, which use private healthcare patient records). School immunization data has limited demographic informationas a result, such analyses are not able to provide demographic characteristics of significant clusters. Further, the resolution of the clusters identified by prior methods is limited since they are typically restricted to disks or well-rounded shapes.MethodsWe use realistic population models for Minnesota (MN) and Washington (WA) state, which provide a model of activities for all individuals in the population. We combine this with school level immunization data for these two states, to estimate vaccine coverage at the level of census block groups. A scan statistic method defined on networks is used for finding significant clusters of under-immunized block groups, without any restrictions on shape. Further we provide the demographic characteristics of these clusters.ResultsWe find 2 significant under-vaccinated clusters in MN and 3 in WA. These are very irregular in shape, in contrast to the circular disks reported in prior work, which rely on the SatScan approach. Some of the clusters found by our method are not contained in those computed using SatScan, a state-of-the-art software tool used in similar studies in other states.ConclusionsThe emergence of under-immunized clusters is a growing concern for public health agencies because they can act as reservoirs of infection and increase the risk of infection into the wider population. Higher resolution clusters computed using our network based approach and population models provide new insights on the structure and characteristics of such clusters and enable targeted interventions.

AB Background: Although the effect of the recent Greek economic crisis and austerity on the population's health and the health system effectiveness have been discussed a lot recently, data on common surgical conditions affecting large part of the population are missing. Using inguinal hernia as a model we investigated possible changes of citizens' attitude regarding the time of referral, the perioperative details and the intraoperative findings of the emergency hernioplasties.MethodsThe present retrospective study was conducted by a Department of Surgery in a tertiary public hospital of the Greek capital. We reviewed the records of all hernioplasties performed during two 5-year periods: 2005-2009 and 2012-2016, i.e. before and during the crisis focusing on the emergency ones (either incarcerated or strangulated).ResultsAn equal number of hernioplasties was performed in both periods. During the crisis however, an emergency hernioplasty was significantly more probable (HR 1.269, 95% CI 1.108-1.1454, p=0.001), at a younger age (p=0.04), mainly in patients younger than 75years old (p=0.0013). More patients presented with intestinal ischemia (7 vs 18, p=0.002), requiring longer hospitalization (5.2 vs 9.6days, p=0.04), with higher cost (560262.4Euro vs 2125 +/- 1180.8Euro p<0.001). In contrast the percentage of patients with intestinal resection, their hospitalization length and treatment-cost remained unchanged. During the crisis there was a non-significant increase of emergency patients requiring ICU postoperatively (0 vs 4, p=0.07) and a non-significant 60% increase of emergency operations in migrants/refugees population (3.5% vs 5.8%, p=0.28). Epidural anesthesia was significantly more frequent during the crisis.Conclusion During the crisis: (i) the emergency hernioplasties increased significantly, (ii) more patients (exclusively Greek) presented with intestinal ischemia requiring longer hospitalization and higher treatment cost, (iii) the mean age of the urgently treated patients decreased significantly (iv) regional (epidural) anesthesia was more frequent. Although a direct causal relation could not be proven by the present study most observations can be explained by an increase of the patients who delayed the elective treatment of their hernia, and by a redistribution of the surgical workload towards big central hospitals. This can be prevented by adequately supporting the small district hospitals.

AB BackgroundImproper use of antimicrobials results in poor treatment and severe bacterial resistance. Breakpoints are routinely used in the clinical laboratory setting to guide clinical decision making. Therefore, the objective of this study was to establish antimicrobial susceptibility breakpoints for danofloxacin against Escherichia coli (E.coli), which is an important pathogen of digestive tract infections.ResultsThe minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 1233 E. coli isolates were determined by the microdilution broth method in accordance with the guidelines in Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document M07-A9. The wild type (WT) distribution or epidemiologic cutoff value (ECV) was set at 8g/mL with statistical analysis. Plasma drug concentration data were used to establish pharmacokinetic (PK) model in swine. The in vitro time kill test in our study demonstrated that danofloxacin have concentration dependent activity against E.coli. The PK data indicated that danofloxacin concentration in plasma was rapidly increased to peak levels at 0.97h and remained detectable until 48h after drug administration. The pharmacodynamic cutoff (COPD) was determined as 0.03g/mL using Monte Carlo simulation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to establish the ECV and COPD of danofloxacin against E.coli with statistical method.ConclusionsCompared to the COPD of danofloxacin against E.coli (0.03g/mL), the ECV for E.coli seemed reasonable to be used as the final breakpoint of danofloxacin against E.coli in pigs. Therefore, the ECV (MIC 8g/mL) was finally selected as the optimum danofloxacin susceptibility breakpoint for swine E.coli. In summary, this study provides a criterion for susceptibility testing and improves prudent use of danofloxacin for protecting public health.

AB BackgroundTuberculosis (TB) remains a significant public health problem in Canadian Inuit communities. In 2016, Canadian Inuit had an incidence rate 35 times the Canadian average. Tobacco use is an important risk factor for TB, and over 60% of Inuit adults smoke. We aimed to estimate changes in TB-related outcomes and costs from reducing tobacco use in Inuit communities.MethodsUsing a transmission model to estimate the initial prevalence of latent TB infection (LTBI), followed by decision analysis modelling, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis that compared the current standard of care for management of TB and LTBI without additional tobacco reduction intervention (Status Quo) with (1) increased tobacco taxation, (2) pharmacotherapy and counselling for smoking cessation, (3) pharmacotherapy, counselling plus mass media campaign, and (4) the combination of all these. Projected outcomes included the following: TB cases, TB-related deaths, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and health system costs, all over 20years.ResultsThe combined strategy was projected to reduce active TB cases by 6.1% (95% uncertainty range 4.9-7.0%) and TB deaths by 10.4% (9.5-11.4%) over 20years, relative to the status quo. Increased taxation was the only cost-saving strategy.ConclusionsCurrently available strategies to reduce commercial tobacco use will likely have a modest impact on TB-related outcomes in the medium term, but some may be cost saving.

AB BackgroundAcinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen causing various nosocomial infections. The spread of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii is a major public health problem. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology and the genetic support of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii isolates collected from Saint-Georges Hospital in Lebanon.MethodsBetween January and August 2016, 31 A. baumannii isolates were collected from sputum samples of patients infected with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and treated with colistin-carbapenem combination therapy. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion method. Carbapenemases, extended spectrum -lactamases encoding genes and mcr-1/2 genes were investigated by RT-PCR and standard PCR. The epidemiological relatedness of the strains was studied using MLST analysis.ResultsMost of the isolates exhibited multidrug-resistant phenotypes. All the isolates were carbapenem-resistant and among them, 30 carried the class D carbapenemase bla(oxa-23) gene while one isolate carried bla(oxa-72) gene. MLST results revealed three sequence types, namely ST2, ST699, and ST627. Isolates having ST2 were the most prevalent clone (29/31, 93.5%).ConclusionsThis study shows a nosocomial spread of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii ST2 having bla(OXA-23) gene in Saint-George in Lebanon. Monitoring and control measures need to be adopted to avoid the spread of A. baumannii to patients.

TI Assessing the performance of real-time epidemic forecasts: A case study
   of Ebola in the Western Area region of Sierra Leone, 2014-15
SO PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CALIBRATION; LIBERIA; AFRICA
AB Real-time forecasts based on mathematical models can inform critical decision-making during infectious disease outbreaks. Yet, epidemic forecasts are rarely evaluated during or after the event, and there is little guidance on the best metrics for assessment. Here, we propose an evaluation approach that disentangles different components of forecasting ability using metrics that separately assess the calibration, sharpness and bias of forecasts. This makes it possible to assess not just how close a forecast was to reality but also how well uncertainty has been quantified. We used this approach to analyse the performance of weekly forecasts we generated in real time for Western Area, Sierra Leone, during the 2013-16 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. We investigated a range of forecast model variants based on the model fits generated at the time with a semi-mechanistic model, and found that good probabilistic calibration was achievable at short time horizons of one or two weeks ahead but model predictions were increasingly unreliable at longer forecasting horizons. This suggests that forecasts may have been of good enough quality to inform decision making based on predictions a few weeks ahead of time but not longer, reflecting the high level of uncertainty in the processes driving the trajectory of the epidemic. Comparing forecasts based on the semi-mechanistic model to simpler null models showed that the best semi-mechanistic model variant performed better than the null models with respect to probabilistic calibration, and that this would have been identified from the earliest stages of the outbreak. As forecasts become a routine part of the toolkit in public health, standards for evaluation of performance will be important for assessing quality and improving credibility of mathematical models, and for elucidating difficulties and trade-offs when aiming to make the most useful and reliable forecasts.

AB Accurate forecasts of influenza incidence can be used to inform medical and public health decision-making and response efforts. However, forecasting systems are uncommon in most countries, with a few notable exceptions. Here we use publicly available data from the World Health Organization to generate retrospective forecasts of influenza peak timing and peak intensity for 64 countries, including 18 tropical and subtropical countries. We find that accurate and well-calibrated forecasts can be generated for countries in temperate regions, with peak timing and intensity accuracy exceeding 50% at four and two weeks prior to the predicted epidemic peak, respectively. Forecasts are significantly less accurate in the tropics and subtropics for both peak timing and intensity. This work indicates that, in temperate regions around the world, forecasts can be generated with sufficient lead time to prepare for upcoming outbreak peak incidence.

TI Even a good influenza forecasting model can benefit from internet-based
   nowcasts, but those benefits are limited
SO PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The ability to produce timely and accurate flu forecasts in the United States can significantly impact public health. Augmenting forecasts with internet data has shown promise for improving forecast accuracy and timeliness in controlled settings, but results in practice are less convincing, as models augmented with internet data have not consistently outperformed models without internet data. In this paper, we perform a controlled experiment, taking into account data backfill, to improve clarity on the benefits and limitations of augmenting an already good flu forecasting model with internet-based nowcasts. Our results show that a good flu forecasting model can benefit from the augmentation of internet-based nowcasts in practice for all considered public health-relevant forecasting targets. The degree of forecast improvement due to nowcasting, however, is uneven across forecasting targets, with short-term forecasting targets seeing the largest improvements and seasonal targets such as the peak timing and intensity seeing relatively marginal improvements. The uneven forecasting improvements across targets hold even when perfect nowcasts are used. These findings suggest that further improvements to flu forecasting, particularly seasonal targets, will need to derive from other, non-nowcasting approaches.

AB In the U.S., more than 80% of African-American smokers use mentholated cigarettes, compared to less than 30% of Caucasian smokers. The reasons for these differences are not well understood. To determine if genetic variation contributes to mentholated cigarette smoking, we performed an exome-wide association analysis in a multiethnic population-based sample from Dallas, TX (N = 561). Findings were replicated in an independent cohort of African Americans from Washington, DC (N = 741). We identified a haplotype of MRGPRX4 (composed of rs7102322[G], encoding N245S, and rs61733596[G], T43T), that was associated with a 5-to-8 fold increase in the odds of menthol cigarette smoking. The variants are present solely in persons of African ancestry. Functional studies indicated that the variant G protein-coupled receptor encoded by MRGPRX4 displays reduced agonism in both arrestin-based and G protein-based assays, and alteration of agonism by menthol. These data indicate that genetic variation in MRGPRX4 contributes to inter-individual and inter-ethnic differences in the preference for mentholated cigarettes, and that the existence of genetic factors predisposing vulnerable populations to mentholated cigarette smoking can inform tobacco control and public health policies.
   Author summary An exome-wide association study revealed a significant association between menthol cigarette use and coding variants in MRGPRX4, which encodes a G-protein coupled receptor expressed in sensory neurons. The variant haplotype is found only in populations of African ancestry, and encodes a receptor that displays reduced agonism by Nateglinide. Our findings indicate genetic variation contributes to the high rate of menthol cigarette use in African Americans.

AB Background Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by the protozoan parasite, Leishmania. The disease remains a global threat to public health requiring effective chemotherapy for control and treatment. In this study, the effect of some selected phenolic compounds on Leishmania donovani was investigated. The compounds were screened for their anti-leishmanial activities against promastigote and intracellular amastigote forms of Leishmania donovani.
   Methodology/Principal findings The dose dependent effect and cytotoxicity of the compounds were determined by the MTT assay. Flow cytometry was used to determine the effect of the compounds on the cell cycle. Parasite morphological analysis was done by microscopy and growth kinetic studies were conducted by culturing cells and counting at 24 hours intervals over 120 hours. The cellular levels of iron in promastigotes treated with compounds was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy and the effect of compounds on the expression of iron dependent enzymes was investigated using RT-qPCR. The IC50 of the compounds ranged from 16.34 M to 124 M compared to amphotericin B and deferoxamine controls. Rosmarinic acid and apigenin were the most effective against the promastigote and the intracellular amastigote forms. Selectivity indexes (SI) of rosmarinic acid and apigenin were 15.03 and 10.45 respectively for promastigotes while the SI of 12.78 and 5.20 respectively was obtained for intracellular amastigotes. Morphologically, 70% of rosmarinic acid treated promastigotes showed rounded morphology similar to the deferoxamine control. About 30% of cells treated with apigenin showed distorted cell membrane. Rosmarinic acid and apigenin induced cell arrest in the G0/G1 phase in promastigotes. Elevated intracellular iron levels were observed in promastigotes when parasites were treated with rosmarinic acid and this correlated with the level of expression of iron dependent genes.
   Conclusions/Significance The data suggests that rosmarinic acid exerts its anti-leishmanial effect via iron chelation resulting in variable morphological changes and cell cycle arrest.
   Author summary The available drugs used in treatment of leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the Leishmania parasite, include pentavalent antimonials and amphotericin B. The cost and associated toxicity of the drugs, side effects and the emergence of drug resistance parasites, as well as the discomfort in drug administration suggests the need for new and better chemotherapeutic interventions. Iron is involved in several biological processes in the Leishmania parasite and it's important for its growth and survival. The effects of using iron chelators to deprive parasite of iron was investigated in this study. Treatment of L. donovani with rosmarinic acid and apigenin inhibited the growth of promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes in a dose dependent manner. Morphologically, the compounds induced alterations in the parasites upon treatments. Rosmarinic acid was observed to cause the dysfunction of the mitochondria and alter the expression of iron dependent enzymes. Rosmarinic acid ability to chelate iron could be responsible for the changes in cell morphology and cell cycle observed.

AB Background Lonomia obliqua venom is nephrotoxic and acute kidney injury (AKI) is the main cause of death among envenomed victims. Mechanism underlying L. obliqua-induced AKI involves renal hypoperfusion, inflammation, tubular necrosis and loss of glomerular filtration and tubular reabsorption capacities. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the contribution of kallikrein to the hemodynamic instability, inflammation and consequent renal and vascular impairment
   Methodology/Principal findings Addition of L. obliqua venom to purified prekallikrein and human plasma in vitro or to vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in culture, was able to generate kallikrein in a dose-dependent manner. Injected in rats, the venom induced AKI and increased kallikrein levels in plasma and kidney. Kallikrein inhibition by aprotinin prevented glomerular injury and the decrease in glomerular filtration rate, restoring fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. The mechanism underlying these effects was associated to lowering renal inflammation, with decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinase expression, reduced tubular degeneration, and protection against oxidative stress. Supporting the key role of kallikrein, we demonstrated that aprotinin inhibited effects directly associated with vascular injury, such as the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and migration of VSMC induced by L. obliqua venom or by diluted plasma obtained from envenomed rats. In addition, kallikrein inhibition also ameliorated venom-induced blood incoagulability and decreased kidney tissue factor expression
   Conclusions/Significance These data indicated that kallikrein and consequently kinin release have a key role in kidney injury and vascular remodeling. Thus, blocking kallikrein may be a therapeutic alternative to control the progression of venom-induced AKI and vascular disturbances.
   Author summary The envenomation by venomous animals is considered a common and serious occupational disease, especially in rural areas of tropical developing countries. Its public health relevance has been largely ignored by medical authorities worldwide. Specifically in regions of southern and southeast Brazil, accidents with the venomous caterpillar Lonomia obliqua have been an emergent problem, not only for their high incidence rates, but also by the severity of the clinical consequences observed in envenomation cases. Frequently, envenomed victims present a severe hemorrhagic syndrome that can progress to acute kidney injury (AKI) and death. L. obliqua venom is highly nephrotoxic, AKI is the main cause of death between patients and its mechanisms are poorly understood. Even after the introduction of antivenom therapy in 1995, there was no reduction in the incidence of AKI. In this work we investigated the contribution of kallikrein to the hemodynamic instability, inflammation and consequent renal and vascular impairment during envenomation. A multidisciplinary approach was employed including methods of renal physiology/biochemistry, morphological and cell culture analysis. We believe the data presented here give new insights to the actual knowledge presenting kallikrein and the kinin system as key points to control the progression of renal disease, which may be explored as an approach complementary to serotherapy.

AB Although leptospirosis is traditionally considered a disease of rural, agricultural and flooded environments, Leptospira spp. are found in a range of habitats and infect numerous host species, with rodents among the most significant reservoirs and vectors. To explore the local ecology of Leptospira spp. in a city experiencing rapid urbanization, we assessed Leptospira prevalence in rodents from three locations in Malaysian Borneo with differing levels of anthropogenic influence: 1) high but stable influence (urban); 2) moderate yet increasing (developing); and 3) low (rural). A total of 116 urban, 122 developing and 78 rural rodents were sampled, with the majority of individuals assigned to either the Rattus rattus lineage R3 (n = 165) or Sundamys muelleri (n = 100). Leptospira spp. DNA was detected in 31.6% of all rodents, with more urban rodents positive (44.8%), than developing (32.0%) or rural rodents (28.1%), and these differences were statistically significant. The majority of positive samples were identified by sequence comparison to belong to known human pathogens L. interrogans (n = 57) and L. borgpetersenii (n = 38). Statistical analyses revealed that both Leptospira species occurred more commonly at sites with higher anthropogenic influence, particularly those with a combination of commercial and residential activity, while L. interrogans infection was also associated with low forest cover, and L. borgpetersenii was more likely to be identified at sites without natural bodies of water. This study suggests that some features associated with urbanization may promote the circulation of Leptospira spp., resulting in a potential public health risk in cities that may be substantially underestimated.
   Author summary Leptospirosis is a significant zoonotic disease that is found in a range of environments worldwide, most notably tropical regions prone to flooding. The bacterial agents of this disease, Leptospira spp., are most often associated with rodents, including species frequently found in urban areas. In cities, rodent populations are often larger and denser than those found in natural environments, which can lead to higher rates of contact with people and impact human disease risk. To investigate the impacts of urbanization on Leptospira spp., we sampled rodents at locations with differing levels of human influence, from highly urbanized to rural, surrounding a city in Malaysian Borneo. We found that 31.6% of all rodents were positive for Leptospira spp. DNA, and that two primary species were present, L. interrogans and L. borgpetersenii, both of which are known human pathogens. Statistical analyses revealed that infected animals were more common in areas with higher levels of human influence, and were more likely to occur at sites with limited forest cover, and mixed commercial and residential activity. Our study adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that there is a significant yet underappreciated risk of leptospirosis for people living in urban environments.

TI Epidemiological situation of yaws in the Americas: A systematic review
   in the context of a regional elimination goal
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Review
ID TREPONEMAL SEROLOGICAL TESTS; CHILDREN; COMMUNITY; PROGRAM
AB Background Yaws is targeted for eradication by 2020 in the WHA66.12 resolution of the World Health Assembly. The objective of this study was to describe the occurrence of yaws in the Americas and to contribute to the compilation of evidence based on published data to undertake the certification of yaws eradication.
   Methodology A systematic review of the epidemiological situation of yaws in the Americas was performed by searching in MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, SCOPUS, Web of Science, DARE and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Experts on the topic were consulted, and institutional WHO/PAHO library databases were reviewed.
   Principal findings Seventy-five full-text articles published between 1839 and 2012 met the inclusion criteria. Haiti and Jamaica were the two countries with the highest number of papers (14.7% and 12.0%, respectively). Three-quarters of the studies were conducted before 1970. Thirty-three countries reported yaws case count or prevalence data. The largest foci in the history were described in Brazil and Haiti. The most recent cases reported were recorded in eight countries: Suriname, Guyana, Colombia, Haiti, Martinique, Dominica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Brazil. Gaps in information and heterogeneity were detected in the methodologies used and outcome reporting, making cross-national and chronological comparisons difficult.
   Conclusions The lack of recent yaws publications may reflect, in the best-case scenario, the interruption of yaws transmission. It should be possible to reach the eradication goal in the region of the Americas, but it is necessary to collect more information. We suggest updating the epidemiological status of yaws, especially in two countries that need to assess ongoing transmission. Twenty-four countries need to demonstrate the interruption of transmission and declare its status of yaws endemicity, and sixteen countries should declare if they are yaws-free. It is necessary to formally verify the achievement of this goal in Ecuador.
   Author summary Yaws is a contagious non-venereal treponematosis caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue, transmitted by skin contact. It is a poverty-related chronic disease characterized by primary and secondary skin lesions, with latent infection and a chronic stage, which could include a destructive process of bones and joints. Early detection and treatment can avoid gross disfigurement and the associated stigma. Currently, the treatment with a single dose of oral azithromycin has proven effective. This systematic review shows that in the Americas there is a need to update the epidemiological situation of yaws and if needed, to implement and optimize the best public health recommended interventions to interrupt transmission and then verify elimination of transmission. Current WHO guidelines define the methodology for monitoring and evaluating yaws control programs. Yearly surveys of pre-school children, though logistically complex, are needed in the post-zero case surveillance.

AB Syphilis is a Sexually Transmitted Infection (IST) with significant importance to public health, due to its impact during pregnancy (Gestational SyphilisGS); especially because syphilis can affect fetus and neonates' development (mother-to-child transmissionMTCT of syphilis), by increasing susceptibility to abortion, premature birth, skeletal malformations, meningitis and pneumonia. Measures to control and eliminate MTCT of syphilis have failed on the last few years in Brazil and this research aimed to identify the seasonality of notified cases of syphilis in a region of SAo Paulo state. The studied region, Pontal do Paranapanema, comprises 32 cities located in the West of SAo Paulo state, in Brazil. Data collected from the National System of Aggravations and Notification (SINAN) website was used to calculate the incidence rate of GS and MTCT. The incidence rate of GS was acquired dividing number of cases by number of women in each municipality and MTCT using number of live births in each year (from 2007 to 2013) in each municipality. This result was then, standardized multiplying incidence rate by 10,000 and expressed as incidence/10,000 women or live births, for GS and MTCT, respectively. To identify possible endemic/epidemic periods, a control diagram was performed using the standard deviation (SD) of incidence rate. Thematic maps representing the spatial distribution of incidence rates were constructed using a Geographic Information System software (GIS, based on cartographic vector available on the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) website. Eighty cases of GS and 61 cases of MTCT were notified in the studied region. An increase of GS notification was detected in the Pontal do Paranapanema in 2011 followed by an increase in number of MTCT cases in the subsequent year, suggesting inefficacy in the treatment during gestational period. Most of those cases were reported on February and November which suggested seasonality for this IST in the region. The control diagram, based on the inputs collected from SINAN, showed no endemic period; however, the most susceptible month to happen an endemic event of GS and MTCT was February. Our study provided a new methodology to understand the syphilis dynamics as a potential tool to improve the success of future measures to control and possibly eliminate MTCT of syphilis.
   Author summary Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that can be transmitted to child during pregnancy, or postpartum, by an infected mother. Syphilis in children can interfere in the development and, in some cases, may lead to death. We analyzed cases of syphilis during pregnancy and mother-to-child transmission of syphilis from 2007 to 2013 occurred in a Brazilian region. We used a public online website provided by the Brazilian government to obtain information about cases, generate map locations and design a transmission pattern in the region. During the period investigated, we identified 80 cases of syphilis in pregnant woman and 61 related to mother-to-child transmission, both notified mainly during Summer (from November to February). Children infection might be related to incorrect treatment of mother and the partner. Not only the mother must be treated but the partner as well, otherwise women may be infected during pregnancy, transmitting syphilis to fetus. This study may help in the establishment of measures to control and eliminate mother-to-child transmission of syphilis.

AB Cats (Felis catus) are reservoirs of several pathogens that affect humans, including Toxoplasma gondii. Infection of pregnant women with T. gondii can cause ocular and neurological lesions in newborns, and congenital toxoplasmosis has been associated with schizophrenia, epilepsy, movement disorders, and Alzheimer's disease. We compared seroprevalence of T. gondii and risk factors in people on seven islands in Mexico with and without introduced cats to determine the effect of cat eradication and cat density on exposure to T. gondii. Seroprevalence was zero on an island that never had cats and 1.8% on an island where cats were eradicated in 2000. Seroprevalence was significantly higher (12-26%) on the five islands with cats, yet it did not increase across a five-fold range of cat density. Having cats near households, being male and spending time on the mainland were significant risk factors for T. gondii seroprevalence among individuals, whereas eating shellfish was protective. Our results suggest that cats are an important source of T. gondii on islands, and eradicating, but not controlling, introduced cats from islands could benefit human health.
   Author summary Infection with T. gondii can cause miscarriage or severe ocular and neurological lesions in newborns, systemic disease in immunocompromised individuals, and has been linked to mental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and movement disorders in adults. On the majority of islands, introduced cats are the only species capable of maintaining the sexual phase of the life cycle of Toxoplasma gondii. Introduced cats on islands are also responsible for 14% of all bird, mammal and reptile extinctions. Their management, which has been implemented as a biodiversity conservation measure, has the potential to reduce or eliminate the burden of diseases caused by T. gondii in island communities via control of its definitive host. To examine if management of introduced cats could reduce risk of infection with T. gondii, we compared the seroprevalence and risk factors associated with T. gondii exposure in people on seven islands with variation in cat density, including one island in which cats were eradicated in the year 2000, and another island in which cats had never been present. We found that eradication of introduced cats on islands could significantly reduce human risk of exposure to T. gondii. Seroprevalence of T. gondii was zero on the island that never had cats and near zero on the island where cats were eradicated. Furthermore, all island resident children born after cats were eradicated showed no evidence of exposure to the parasite. The odds of seropositivity to T. gondii were nearly five-fold higher in people that had cats near their homes. On islands with cats, we found no association between local cat density and T. gondii seroprevalence, suggesting that complete eradication rather than control of cat population densities is necessary to reduce public health impacts of toxoplasmosis.

TI Strategies to increase adoption of animal vaccines by smallholder

ID RIFT-VALLEY FEVER; EMPIRICAL APPLICATION; VACCINATION DELIVERY;
   VETERINARY SERVICES; HEALTH-SERVICES; POOR; AFRICA
AB Background Most smallholder farmers (SHFs) and marginalized populations (MPs) in Africa, Asia, and Latin America depend on livestock for their livelihoods. However, significant numbers of these animals do not achieve their potential, die due to disease, or transmit zoonotic diseases. Existing vaccines could prevent and control some of these diseases, but frequently the vaccines do not reach SHFs, especially MPs, making it necessary for specific vaccine adoption strategies.
   Principal findings Several strategies that have the potential to increase the adoption of animal vaccines by SHFs and MPs have been identified depending on the type of vaccines involved. The strategies differed depending on whether the vaccines were aimed at diseases that cause economic losses, government-controlled diseases, or neglected diseases. The adoption of vaccines for neglected diseases presents a major challenge, because they are mostly for zoonotic diseases that produce few or no clinical signs in the animals, making it more difficult for the farmers to appreciate the value of the vaccines. Strategies can be aimed at increasing the availability of quality vaccines, so that they are produced in sufficient quantity, or aimed at increasing access and demand by SHFs and/or MPs. Some of the strategies to increase vaccine adoption might not provide a definite solution but might facilitate vaccine uptake by decreasing barriers. These strategies are varied and include technical considerations, policy components, involvement by the private sector (local and international), and innovation.
   Conclusions Several strategies with the potential to reduce livestock morbidity and mortality, or prevent zoonoses in SHFs communities and MPs through vaccination, require the involvement of donors and international organisations to stimulate and facilitate sustainable adoption. This is especially the case for neglected zoonotic diseases. Support for national and regional vaccine manufacturers is also required, especially for vaccines against diseases of interest only in the developing world and public goods.

AB Dengue fever (DEN) is the most common arboviral disease in the world and dengue virus (DENV) causes 390 million annual infections around the world, of which 240 million are inapparent and 96 million are symptomatic. During the past decade a changing epidemiological pattern has been observed in Africa, with DEN outbreaks reported in all regions. In Senegal, all DENV serotypes have been reported. These important changes in the epidemiological profile of DEN are occurring in a context where there is no qualified vaccine against DEN. Further there is significant gap of knowledge on the vector bionomics and transmission dynamics in the African region to effectively prevent and control epidemics. Except for DENV-2, few studies have been performed with serotypes 1, 3, and 4, so this study was undertaken to fill out this gap. We assessed the vector competence of Aedes (Diceromyia) furcifer, Ae. (Diceromyia) taylori, Ae. (Stegomyia) luteocephalus, sylvatic and urban Ae. (Stegomyia) aegypti populations from Senegal for DENV-1, DENV-3 and DENV-4 using experimental oral infection. Whole bodies and wings/legs were tested for DENV presence by cell culture assays and saliva samples were tested by real time RT-PCR to estimate infection, disseminated infection and transmission rates. Our results revealed a low capacity of sylvatic and urban Aedes mosquitoes from Senegal to transmit DENV-1, DENV-3 and DENV-4 and an impact of infection on their mortality. The highest potential transmission rate was 20% despite the high susceptibility and disseminated infection rates up to 93.7% for the 3 Ae. aegypti populations tested, and 84.6% for the sylvatic vectors Ae. furcifer, Ae. taylori and Ae. luteocephalus.
   Author summary Dengue fever remains a major public health problem in all tropical regions of the world and causes 390 million infections each year. In Africa, while dengue outbreaks were rare during the last century, recurrent urban epidemic have been reported in all regions the last decade. Serotype 3, never reported in West Africa, caused major outbreaks in 2009 in several capital cities while serotype 2, usually confined to the forest cycle, spilled over into urban areas in Senegal and Mauritania in 2014-2015. These changes are occurring in a context where vector control remains the only effective approach to prevent and control epidemics. However, the design and the implementation of efficient vector control require an accurate knowledge of the vector bionomics and competence while such data are lacking in the African region. To fill out this gap we experimentally infected domestic and wild mosquitoes from Senegal to assess their vector competence for dengue serotypes 1, 3 and 4. Finally both domestic and wild Senegalese mosquitoes showed a low ability to transmit dengue viruses.

TI Ebola virus disease-related stigma among survivors declined in Liberia
   over an 18-month, post-outbreak period: An observational cohort study
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID COMMUNITY; HEALTH; HIV
AB Background While qualitative assessments of Ebola virus disease (EVD)-related stigma have been undertaken among survivors and the general public, quantitative tools and assessment targeting survivors have been lacking.
   Methods and findings Beginning in June 2015, EVD survivors from seven Liberian counties, where most of the country's EVD cases occurred, were eligible to enroll in a longitudinal cohort. Seven stigma questions were adapted from the People Living with HIV Stigma Index and asked to EVD survivors over the age of 12 at initial visit (median 358 days post-EVD) and 18 months later. Primary outcome was a 7-item EVD-related stigma index. Explanatory variables included age, gender, educational level, pregnancy status, post-EVD hospitalization, referred to medical care and EVD source. Proportional odds logistic regression models and generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to assess stigma at initial visit and over time. The stigma questions were administered to 859 EVD survivors at initial visit and 741 (86%) survivors at follow-up. While 63% of survivors reported any stigma at initial visit, only 5% reported any stigma at follow-up. Over the 18-month period, there was a significant decrease in stigma among EVD survivors (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR], 0.02; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.01-0.04). At initial visit, having primary, junior high or vocational education, and being referred to medical care was associated with higher odds of stigma (educational level: AOR, 1.82; 95%CI, 1.27-2.62; referred: AOR, 1.50; 95%CI, 1.16-1.94). Compared to ages of 20-29, those who had ages of 12-19 or 50+ experienced lower odds of stigma (12-19: AOR, 0.32; 95%CI, 0.21-0.48; 50+: AOR, 0.58 95%CI, 0.37-0.91).
   Conclusions Our data suggest that EVD-related stigma was much lower more than a year after active Ebola transmission ended in Liberia. Among survivors who screened negative for stigma, additional probing may be considered based on age, education, and referral to care.
   Author summary Survivors of Ebola virus disease (EVD) experienced stigma throughout the 2013-2016 West African outbreak, but post-outbreak experiences of EVD-related stigma have been limited to qualitative studies. We adapted a 7-item EVD-related stigma index from the HIV literature, which was administered to EVD survivors of the observational cohort, Ebola Natural History Study, in Liberia beginning in June 2015. While 63% of 859 EVD survivors reported any EVD-related stigma during the end of the outbreak in Liberia, only 5% of 741 survivors reported any stigma 18-months post-outbreak, suggesting that survivors experienced little to no EVD-related stigma in the absence of active Ebola virus transmission. Among survivors who screened negative for stigma, additional probing may be considered based on age, education, and referral to care.

TI A multi-country study of the economic burden of dengue fever based on
   patient-specific field surveys in Burkina Faso, Kenya, and Cambodia
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID IMMUNOLOGICAL BEHAVIOR; COST
AB Background Dengue fever is a rapidly growing public health problem in many parts of the tropics and sub-tropics in the world. While there are existing studies on the economic burden of dengue fever in some of dengue-endemic countries, cost components are often not standardized, making cross-country comparisons challenging. Furthermore, no such studies have been available in Africa.
   Methods/Principal findings A patient-specific survey questionnaire was developed and applied in Burkina Faso, Kenya, and Cambodia in a standardized format. Multiple interviews were carried out in order to capture the entire cost incurred during the period of dengue illness. Both private (patient's out-of-pocket) and public (non-private) expenditure were accessed to understand how the economic burden of dengue is distributed between private and non-private payers. A substantial number of dengue-confirmed patients were identified in all three countries: 414 in Burkina Faso, 149 in Kenya, and 254 in Cambodia. The average cost of illness for dengue fever was $26 (95% CI $23-$29) and $134 (95% CI $119-$152) per inpatient in Burkina Faso and Cambodia, respectively. In the case of outpatients, the average economic burden per episode was $13 (95% CI $23-$29) in Burkina Faso and $23 (95% CI $19-$28) in Kenya. Compared to Cambodia, public contributions were trivial in Burkina Faso and Kenya, reflecting that a majority of medical costs had to be directly borne by patients in the two countries.
   Conclusions/Significance The cost of illness for dengue fever is significant in the three countries. In particular, the current study sheds light on the potential economic burden of the disease in Burkina Faso and Kenya where existing evidence is sparse in the context of dengue fever, and underscores the need to achieve Universal Health Coverage. Given the availability of the current (CYD-TDV) and second-generation dengue vaccines in the near future, our study outcomes can be used to guide decision makers in setting health policy priorities.
   Author summary Dengue fever is a major public health concern in many parts of South-East Asia and South America. In addition to countries where dengue has been highly prevalent for many years, there is a growing concern on the undocumented burden of dengue in Africa. Following the successful execution of the first-round economic burden study in Vietnam, Thailand, and Colombia by the Dengue Vaccine Initiative, the second-round economic burden study was implemented in Burkina Faso, Kenya and Cambodia using the same standardized methodology. In particular, the second-round study targeted GAVI eligible countries for future vaccine introductions and included two African countries where the burden of dengue was relatively unknown. Our study outcomes show that the economic burden of dengue fever is significant in all three countries. The dengue vaccination era began in 2016 with the first dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) although its public use should be carefully determined due to the safety concerns related to the vaccine. Considering that there are other second-generation dengue vaccines in development, the current study outcomes provide an important step to estimate the economic benefits of vaccination in the three countries.

TI The separation of trypanosomes from blood by anion exchange
   chromatography: From Sheila Lanham's discovery 50 years ago to a gold
   standard for sleeping sickness diagnosis
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID CENTRIFUGATION; MICE
AB Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), or sleeping sickness, is a neglected tropical disease that is fatal if untreated, caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and T. brucei rhodesiense. In its 2012 roadmap, WHO targeted HAT for elimination as a public health problem in 2020 and for zero transmission in 2030. Diagnosis of HAT is a multistep procedure comprising of clinical suspicion, confirmation, and stage determination. Suspects are identified on clinical signs and/or on screening for specific antibodies. Parasitological confirmation of suspects remains mandatory to avoid unnecessary toxic drug administration. The positive predictive value of the antibody detection tests is low. Simple parasite detection techniques, microscopic examination of lymph node aspirate, or stained thick blood films lack sensitivity, whereas in T. brucei gambiense patients, the number of blood trypanosomes may be very low. Parasite concentration techniques are therefore indispensable. Half a century ago, Sheila Lanham discovered a technique to separate trypanosomes from the blood of infected rodents, based on anion exchange chromatography with diethyl amino ethyl (DEAE) cellulose, a weak anion exchanger. Between pH 6-9, trypanosome surface is less negatively charged than that of blood cells. When blood is poured on top of a DEAE cellulose column, blood cells are retained, whereas parasites pass the column together with the elution buffer. The result is a pure suspension of trypanosomes that retain their morphology and infectivity. Because cell surface charges vary among trypanosome and mammal species, the optimal buffer pH and ionic strength conditions for different combinations of host and trypanosome species were established. Lanham's technique revolutionized the diagnosis of HAT. It is indispensable in the production of the Card Agglutination Test for Trypanosomiasis (CATT), the most used field test for screening in T. brucei gambiense HAT foci and essential to confirm the diagnosis in suspected people. Lumsden and colleagues developed the mini anion exchange centrifugation technique (mAECT). After adaptation for field conditions, its superior diagnostic and analytical sensitivity compared to another concentration technique was demonstrated. It was recommended as the most sensitive test for demonstrating trypanosomes in human blood. At the beginning of the 21st century, the mAECT was redesigned, allowing examination of a larger volume of blood, up to 0.35 ml with whole blood and up to 10 ml with buffy coat. The plastic collector tube in the new kit is also used for detection of trypanosomes in the cerebrospinal fluid. Unfortunately, mAECT also has some disadvantages, including its price, the need to centrifuge the collector tube, and the fact that it is manufactured on a noncommercial basis at only two research institutes. In conclusion, 50 years after Sheila Lanham's discovery, CATT and mAECT have become essential elements in the elimination of HAT.

AB Background Diarrheal diseases are an important cause of morbidity and mortality among children in developing countries. We aimed to study the etiology and severity of diarrhea in children living in the low-income semiarid region of Brazil.
   Methodology This is a cross-sectional, age-matched case-control study of diarrhea in children aged 2-36 months from six cities in Brazil's semiarid region. Clinical, epidemiological, and anthropometric data were matched with fecal samples collected for the identification of enteropathogens.
   Results We enrolled 1,200 children, 596 cases and 604 controls. By univariate analysis, eight enteropathogens were associated with diarrhea: Norovirus GII (OR 5.08, 95% CI 2.10, 12.30), Adenovirus (OR 3.79, 95% CI 1.41, 10.23), typical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (tEPEC), (OR 3.28, 95% CI 1.39, 7.73), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC LT and ST producing toxins), (OR 2.58, 95% CI 0.99, 6.69), rotavirus (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.20, 3.02), shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC; OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.16, 2.69), enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.16, 1.83) and Giardia spp. (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.05, 1.84). By logistic regression of all enteropathogens, the best predictors of diarrhea were norovirus, adenovirus, rotavirus, STEC, Giardia spp. and EAEC. A high diarrhea severity score was associated with EAEC.
   Conclusions Six enteropathogens: Norovirus, Adenovirus, Rotavirus, STEC, Giardia spp., and EAEC were associated with diarrhea in children from Brazil's semiarid region. EAEC was associated with increased diarrhea severity.
   Author summary Most childhood diarrheal diseases studies focus on children from health centers or emergency hospitals that contribute to a lack of understanding of the etiology of community diarrhea. We aimed to investigate the etiology and severity of diarrheal diseases in children living in Brazil's low-income, semiarid region communities. We used a case-control study of diarrhea (1,200 children, 596 cases and 604 controls) and showed that six enteropathogens (norovirus, adenovirus, rotavirus, STEC, Giardia and EAEC) are associated with diarrhea in these communities. Furthermore, enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) was associated with a high diarrhea clinical severity score. These findings help further the understanding of diarrheal disease etiology of previously unevaluated children from Brazil's low-income semiarid region. This study contributes new information that expands our knowledge of diarrheal etiology in non-hospitalized children from developing countries. Moreover, we believe this work will support further research on specific enteropathogens, with special attention to the role of EAEC in severe cases of diarrhea and guide public health policies and physicians in the management of diarrheal diseases in Brazil's low-income semiarid region.

TI Inadequate knowledge about snakebite envenoming symptoms and application
   of harmful first aid methods in the community in high snakebite
   incidence areas of Myanmar
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
AB Introduction Every year millions of people in developing countries suffer from snakebite, causing a large number of deaths and long term complications. Prevention and appropriate first aid could reduce the incidence and improve the health outcomes for those who suffer bites. However, many communities where snakebite is a major issue suffer from a lack of information about prevention and first aid measures that a family or community member could take to prevent severe envenoming, complications and poor outcomes. Myanmar suffers from a high burden of snakebites with a large number of deaths. As part of a health services and community development program, a community survey was conducted to identify communities' knowledge about snakebite and their sequelae, and knowledge and practice about first aid and health services use.
   Method 4,276 rural residents of Kyaukse and Madaya townships in the Mandalay region were recruited by cluster sampling, involving random selection of 144 villages and random sampling of 30 households from each village. One adult member of each household was interviewed using a structured questionnaire.
   Results The incidence of snakebite was 116/100,000 people. Respondents reported 15 different types of snakes in the area, with Russell's Viper, Cobra and Green snakes as the most common. 88% of the people informed that working in the fields and forests was when most of the bites occur. A majority knew about snakebite prevention methods such as wearing long boots. However, only a few people knew about the specific symptoms caused by snakebites. Only 39% knew about the correct methods of first aid. More than 60% mentioned tourniquet as a first aid method, though this may cause significant complications such as ischaemia of the limb. 88% said that they would take a snakebite victim to a government hospital, and 58% mentioned availability of antivenom as the reason for doing this. At the same time, the majority mentioned that traditional methods existed for first aid and treatment and 25% mentioned at least one harmful traditional method as an effective measure that they might use.
   Conclusion The community is aware of snakebites as a major public health issue and know how to prevent them. However, the high incidence of snakebites point to lack of application of preventive methods. The community recognise the need for treatment with antivenom. However, inadequate knowledge about appropriate first aid methods, and a reliance on using tourniquets require a targeted education program. Existing knowledge in communities, albeit insufficient, provides a good starting point for mass media educational campaigns.
   Author summary Snakebite is a major public health problem, particularly in developing countries in the tropics, and every year millions of people suffer from snakebite causing a large number of deaths and long term complications. Communities' knowledge about snakebite prevention practices and appropriate basic first aid could reduce the number of snakebites and improve the health outcomes for those who suffer bites. However, many communities where snakebite is a major issue may lack information about prevention and first aid measures that a family or community member could take to prevent severe complications and poor outcomes. Myanmar suffers from a high burden of snakebites with a large number of deaths. We conducted a community survey in two townships to identify communities' knowledge about snakebite prevention, first aid and health services use. The survey informed that a large majority of people were aware that working in the fields and forests was when most of the bites occur. Similarly, a majority has the knowledge about snakebite prevention methods such as wearing long boots. However, the majority did not know about the correct methods of first aid, with many people mentioning tourniquet as a first aid method. While the community is aware of how to prevent snakebites, the fact that number of snakebites is high points to lack of application of those preventive methods. The inadequate knowledge about appropriate first aid methods with a reliance on using tourniquets informs about the need for public health education programs.

AB Hantaviruses can cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the Americas and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia. In recent decades, repeated outbreaks of hantavirus disease have led to public concern and have created a global public health burden. Hantavirus spillover from natural hosts into human populations could be considered an ecological process, in which environmental forces, behavioral determinants of exposure, and dynamics at the human-animal interface affect human susceptibility and the epidemiology of the disease. In this review, we summarize the progress made in understanding hantavirus epidemiology and rodent reservoir population biology. We mainly focus on three species of rodent hosts with longitudinal studies of sufficient scale: the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius, the main reservoir host for Hantaan virus [HTNV], which causes HFRS) in Asia, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus, the main reservoir host for Sin Nombre virus [SNV], which causes HPS) in North America, and the bank vole (Myodes glareolus, the main reservoir host for Puumala virus [PUUV], which causes HFRS) in Europe. Moreover, we discuss the influence of ecological factors on human hantavirus disease outbreaks and provide an overview of research perspectives.

   VERTICAL TRANSMISSION; UNITED-STATES; ENDEMIC AREA; PREVENTION;
   PREGNANCY; BRAZIL; EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Visceral Leishmaniasis is a deadly disease caused by Leishmania infantum, endemic in more than 98 countries across the globe. Although the most common means of transmission is via a sand fly vector, there is growing evidence that vertical transmission may be critical for maintaining L. infantum infection within the reservoir, canine, population. Vertical transmission is also an important cause of infant morbidity and mortality particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. While vertical transmission of visceralizing species of Leishmania has been reported around the globe, risk factors associated with this unique means of Leishmania transmission have not been identified therefore interventions regarding this means of transmission have been virtually non-existent. Furthermore, the basic reproductive number, (R-0), or number of new L. infantum infections that one infected mother or dam can cause has not been established for vertical transmission, also hampering the ability to assess the impact of this means of transmission within reservoir of human hosts. Canine Leishmaniosis (CanL) is enzootic within a U.S. hunting dog population. CanL is transmitted within this population via transplacental transmission with no reported vector transmission, despite many repeated attempts to find infected sand flies associated with these dogs and kennels. This population with predominantly, if not solely, vertical transmission of L. infantum was used to evaluate the critical risk factors for vertical transmission of Leishmania and establish the R-0 of vertical L. infantum infection. Evaluation of 124 animals born to eighteen dams diagnostically positive for infection with L. infantum showed that there was a 13.84x greater chance of being positive for L. infantum within their lifetime if the mother was also positive within her lifetime (RR: 13.84, 95% CI: 3.54-54.20, p-value: <0.0001). The basic reproductive number for vertically transmitted L. infantum within this cohort was 4.12. These results underscore that there is a high risk of L. infantum infection to transmit from mother to offspring. Targeted public health interventions and control efforts that address vertical transmission of L. infantum are necessary in endemic countries to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis.
   Author summary Canine leishmaniosis (CanL) is a deadly disease caused by Leishmania infantum parasite, it is found in animal populations, including people, in more than 98 countries across the globe. CanL was first identified within the US in hunting dogs 1980 and then again in 1999 when a large outbreak in a kennel in New York occurred. As the US is usually not considered a tropical country, there was much debate about how this neglected, vector borne, tropical disease had made its way into these dogs. We found that within the U.S. hunting dog population CanL is transmitted from mom to pup with no reported sand fly transmission in the population, despite multiple attempts to find infected sand flies associated with these dogs. While vertical transmission of this disease has been reported in case reports around the globe, risk factors associated with this unique means of Leishmania transmission are not known. Furthermore, the basic reproductive number, (R-0), or number of new infections that one infected animal can cause has not been reported for vertical transmission of L. infantum. It is important to know the R-0 as it helps identify how infectious a route of transmission can be and therefore how easy it might be to control this infection. A cohort of 124 dogs from 18 dams was analyzed from 1999 to 2016 for factors related to vertical transmission. Offspring from dams ever diagnostically positive for infection with L. infantum were 13.84x more likely to become positive for L. infantum themselves within their lifetime (RR: 13.84 95% CI: 3.54-54.20 p-value: <0.0001). The basic reproductive number for vertically transmitted L. infantum within this cohort was 4.12. These results underscore that an infected mom is highly likely to infect her offspring if treatment is not started to prevent transmission. There is a need for any public health prevention and control efforts to address vertical as well as vector transmission of canine leishmaniosis in endemic countries.

   RODENTS; SHREWS; WORLD; LASSA; WILD
AB Background Mammarenaviruses are associated with human hemorrhagic fever diseases in Africa and America. Recently, a rodent mammarenavirus, Wenzhu virus (WENV) and related viruses, have been reported in China, Cambodia, and Thailand. Moreover, in Cambodia, these viruses were suspected to be associated with human disease. In China, Yunnan Province is famous for its abundant animal and plant diversity and is adjacent to several South-eastern Asia countries. Therefore, it is necessary to know whether WENV-related viruses, or other mammarenaviruses, are prevalent in this province.
   Methodology/Principal findings Small mammals were trapped, euthanized, and sampled. Mammarenavirus RNA was detected using a nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantified by real-time RT-PCR. A total of 1040 small mammals belonging to 13 genera and 26 species were trapped in Yunnan Province. WENV-related mammarenaviruses were detected in 41 rodent liver samples, mainly in brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) and oriental house rats (R. tanezumi).Viral nucleocapsid protein was detected in liver sections by indirect immunofluorescence assay. Full-length-genomes were amplified by RT-PCR and used for phylogenetic analysis with the MEGA package. Recombination analysis was performed using the SimPlot and Recombination Detection Program.
   Conclusions/Significance WENV related viruses circulated in small mammals in Yunnan Province. Whole genome sequence analysis of five selected viral strains showed that these viruses are closely related to WENVs discovered in Asia and form an independent branch in the phylogenetic tree in the WENV clade. Paying attention to investigate the influence of these viruses to public health is essential in the epidemic regions.
   Author summary Rodents are natural reservoirs of mammarenavirus. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), isolated in Asian countries during the 1990s, has a worldwide distribution and was the first mammarenavirus isolated. In 2014, a second mammarenavirus, Wenzhu virus (WENV), was identified in rodents in Zhejiang Province of China and later in Guangdong, Shandong, and Hainan Provinces. Most importantly, WENV or related viruses were reported in Thailand and Cambodia. In Cambodia, the isolated virus was associated with human respiratory diseases. In this study, we detected WENV or related viruses in Yunnan Province and found a high prevalence in rats of two species (Rattus norvegicus and R. tanezumi). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete L and S segments of five strains showed that these viruses form an independent phylogenetic branch in WENV clade most closely related to WENVs found in China and Cambodia. Considering the wide spread distribution of rats and altered distribution patterns due to ecological changes, we propose that these viruses may have a wider prevalence and be found in countries from South-eastern Asia to China. Given that WENV may be associated with human diseases, it is necessary to improve surveillances of these viruses in their natural reservoirs and in humans.

AB West Nile virus (WNV) has been circulating in California since its first detection in 2003, causing repeated outbreaks affecting public, wildlife and veterinary health. Epidemics of WNV are difficult to predict due to the multitude of factors influencing transmission dynamics among avian and mosquito hosts. Typically, high levels of WNV amplification are required for outbreaks to occur, and therefore associated viral strains may exhibit enhanced virulence and mortality in competent bird species resulting in increased mosquito infection prevalence. In our previous study, most WNV isolates made from California during 2007-08 showed increased fitness when competed in House Finches (HOFI, Haemorhous mexicanus) and Culex tarsalis Coquillett mosquitoes against COAV997-5nt, a genetically marked recombinant virus derived from a 2003 California strain. Herein, we evaluated the competitive fitness of WNV strains isolated during California epidemics in 2004, 2005, 2007, 2011 and 2012 against COAV997-5nt. These outbreak isolates did not produce elevated mortality in HOFIs, but replicated more efficiently than did COAV997-5nt based on quantification of WNV RNA copies in sera, thereby demonstrating increased competitive fitness. Oral co-infections in Cx. tarsalis resulted in similar virus-specific infection and transmission rates, indicating that outbreak isolates did not have a fitness advantage over COAV997-5nt. Collectively, WNV isolates from outbreaks demonstrated relatively greater avian, but not vector, replicative fitness compared to COAV997-5nt, similar to previously characterized non-outbreak isolates of WNV. Our results indicated that ecological rather than viral factors may facilitate WNV amplification to outbreak levels, but monitoring viral phenotypes through competitive fitness studies may provide insight into altered replication and transmission potential among emerging WNV strains.
   Author summary West Nile virus (WNV) is the cause of the largest mosquito-borne epidemic in the United States in recent history, with over 46,000 reported human cases to date, including >2000 deaths. Since the detection of WNV in California in 2003, repeated outbreaks have been associated with explosive WNV amplification in local mosquito and bird populations. Along with climatic and ecological factors, vector-host-pathogen interactions are potential drivers of WNV epidemics and warrant study. Here, we evaluated the competitive fitness of five WNV isolates made during Californian outbreaks from 2004-2012 by co-infection of Culex tarsalis mosquitoes and House Finches against a 2003 founding virus strain. Results indicated that competitive fitness in HOFIs was greater for four of the outbreak isolates, but coincidentally elevated mortality was not observed and viral RNA loads were lower compared to previously studied enzootic strains of WNV. Mosquito competitions resulted in levels of infection and transmission that did not differ among strains.

AB As an important vector of dengue and Zika, Aedes albopictus has been the fastest spreading invasive mosquitoes in the world over the last 3-4 decades. Cold tolerance is important for survival and expansion of insects. Ae. albopictus adults are generally considered to be cold-intolerant that cannot survive at subzero temperature. However, we found that Ae. albopictus could survive for several hours' exposure to -9 to -19 C-o so long as it was exposed with water. Median lethal time (LT50) of Ae. albopictus exposed to -15 and -19 C-o with water increased by more than 100 times compared to those exposed to the same subzero temperature without water. This phenomenon also existed in adult Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus. Ae. albopictus female adults which exposed to low subzero temperature at -9 C-o with water had similar longevity and reproductive capacity to those of females without cold exposure. Cold exposure after a blood meal also have no detrimental impact on survival capacity of female adult Ae. albopictus compared with those cold exposed without a blood meal. Moreover, our results showed that rapid cold hardening (RCH) was induced in Ae. albopictus during exposing to low subzero temperature with water. Both the RCH and the relative high subzero temperature of water immediate after cold exposure might provide this strong protection against low subzero temperature. The molecular basis of water-induced protection for Ae. albopictus might refer to the increased glycerol during cold exposure, as well as the increased glucose and hsp70 during recovery from cold exposure. Our results suggested that the water-induced strong protection against acute decrease of air temperature for adult mosquitoes might be important for the survival and rapid expansion of Ae. albopictus.
   Author summary Aedes albopictus is one of two most important vectors for dengue and zika. During the last 3-4 decades, this mosquito has spread from native Asian area to all continents except Antarctica, becoming the most invasive mosquitoes which imposed extensive public health threat to human beings throughout the world. Cold tolerance is important for distribution and survival of insects. During the expansion of Ae. albopictus, especially a spatial expansion to cooler climate areas, it needs to cope with cold temperatures. Moreover, because of such widespread distribution adult Ae. albopictus will certainly often encounter sudden drops in air temperature even below subzero that often happens in early spring and winter, and late autumn. Thus far, adult Ae. albopictus are generally considered to be cold-intolerant that can not survive at subzero temperature. In this study, we found that water can provide strong protection against low subzero temperature even below -10 C-o. Cold exposure of adult female Ae. albopictus to low subzero temperature with water either before or after a blood meal have no detrimental impact on fitness costs of these adult mosquitoes. Considering water is common in nature, our results indicated that during the expansion of Ae. albopictus especially when adult mosquitoes encounter a sudden drop in air temperature water could be a good shelter for cope with such cold temperature below subzero.

AB The accurate diagnosis of sporotrichosis and identification at the species level are critical for public health and appropriate patient management. Compared with morphological identification methods, molecular diagnostic tests are rapid and have high sensitivity and standardized operating processes. Therefore, we designed a novel multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method based on the calmodulin (CAL) gene for the identification of clinically relevant Sporothrix species: S. globosa, S. schenckii s. str., and S. brasiliensis. We evaluated the assay with clinical and spiked samples and assessed its diagnostic performance by comparing the results to those of culture and species-specific PCR. Thirty-three DNA templates were used to detect assay specificity, and three plasmids were constructed to create a standard curve and determine the limits of detection (LODs). For nucleic acid detection, the sensitivity and specificity reached 100%. The LODs were 10 copies, 10 copies and 100 copies for S. globosa, S. schenckii s. str and S. brasiliensis, respectively. For the clinical samples, the positive detection rates by culture, species-specific PCR and the multiplex real-time PCR assay were 87.9% (29/33), 39.4% (13/33), and 93.9% (31/33), respectively. For the spiked samples, the positive detection rates were both 100% for S. schenckii s. str and S. brasiliensis. Based on the above results, compared with culture and other molecular diagnosis methods, the novel multiplex real-time PCR assay is effective, fast, accurate, and highly sensitive. It has a lower reaction cost and lower sample volume requirements, can detect co-infections, and allows for standardized operation and easier interpretation of results. In the future, this assay could be developed into a commercial kit for the diagnosis and identification of S. globosa, S. schenckii s. str, and S. brasiliensis.
   Author summary Sporotrichosis is a subacute or chronic infectious disease caused by dimorphic fungi of Sporothrix spp. The genus Sporothrix consists of several species with different geographic distributions, virulence, and antifungal susceptibilities, making species-level identification necessary. S. brasiliensis, S. globosa, S. schenckii s. str and S. luriei make up the pathogenic clade of the genus Sporothrix. Importantly, S. luriei has a low clinical-epidemiological impact within this genus. Therefore, we designed a novel multiplex real-time PCR method using fluorescent probes for the identification of S. globosa, S. schenckii s. str, and S. brasiliensis. We designed a pair of primers based on the conserved sequence of the calmodulin gene of Sporothrix spp. and probes with different fluorescent signals based on the divergent sequences of S. globosa, S. schenckii s. str and S. brasiliensis. Through the verification of nucleic acid, clinical and spiked sample detection, the multiplex real-time PCR could quickly and accurately identify the three clinically relevant species of Sporothrix spp. with high sensitivity. This new assay could be applied in epidemiology, clinical diagnosis, and experiments with sporotrichosis to control new outbreaks, reduce diagnostic and identification time, and improve test efficiency.
