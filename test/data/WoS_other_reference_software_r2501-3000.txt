AB As the world's population ages, the number of people receiving total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been on the rise. Although patients with diabetes mellitus are known to face greater risks of TKA postoperative infection and revision TKA owing to diabetic complications, studies on whether such patients' participation in pay for performance (P4P) programs influences the incidence rates of TKA postoperative infection or revision TKA are still lacking. This study examined the 2002-2012 data of Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database to conduct a retrospective cohort analysis of diabetic patients over 50 years old who have received TKA. To reduce any selection bias between patients joining and not joining the P4P program, propensity score matching was applied. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine the influence of the P4P program on TKA postoperative infection and revision TKA, and the results indicate that joining P4P lowered the risk of postoperative infection (HR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.77-1.08), however, which was not statistically significant, and significantly lowered the risk of revision TKA (HR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.39-0.72). Being younger and male, having multiple comorbid conditions or greater diabetic severity, receiving care at regional or public hospitals, and not having a diagnosis of degenerative or rheumatoid arthritis were identified as factors for higher risk of TKA postoperative infection for patients with diabetes. As for the risk of revision TKA, postoperative infection and being younger were identified as factors for a significantly higher risk (p < 0.05).

TI Calorie information and dieting status modulate reward and control
   activation during the evaluation of food images

AB Several public health departments throughout North America have responded to the obesity epidemic by mandating that restaurants publish calories at the point of purchase-with the intention of encouraging healthier food decisions. To help determine whether accompanying calorie information successfully changes a food's appetitive value, this study investigated the influence of calorie information on brain responses to food images. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning, dieting (N = 22) and non-dieting (N = 20) participants viewed pictures of food with and without calorie information and rated their desire to eat the food. When food images were paired with calorie information, not only did self-reported desire to eat the food decrease, but reward system activation (Neurosynth-defined from the term "food") decreased and control system activation (the fronto-parietal [FP] control system) increased. Additionally, a parametric modulation of reward activation by food preferences was attenuated in the context of calorie information. Finally, whole brain multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) revealed patterns of activation in a region of the reward system-the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)-that were more similar for food images presented with and without calorie information in dieting than non-dieting participants, suggesting that dieters may spontaneously consider calorie information when viewing food. Taken together, these results suggest that calorie information may alter brain responses to food cues by simultaneously reducing reward system activation and increasing control system activation. Moreover, individuals with greater experience or stronger motivations to consider calorie information (i.e., dieters) may more naturally do so, as evidenced by a greater degree of representational similarity between food images with and without calorie information. Combining an awareness of calories with the motivation to control them may more effectively elicit diet-related behavior change.

TI School-based behavioral intervention to reduce the habit of smokeless
   tobacco and betel quid use in high-risk youth in Karachi: A randomized
   controlled trial
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ORAL-CANCER; METAANALYSIS; BIOLOGY; HEALTH
AB There have been recent surges in the use of smokeless tobacco (SLT) and betel quid (BQ) chew among adolescents in South East Asian countries, with an increase, on average, of 7% to 15% between 2004 and 2013, necessitating interventional investigations to modify this behavior. The current intervention was aimed towards changing adolescents' perceptions regarding the harmful effects of SLT and BQ use and encouraging them to quit. This randomized control trial involved 2140 adolescents from 26 private and public-sector schools in Karachi, Pakistan. After randomization, 1185 individuals were placed in the intervention group and administered a behavior changing intervention (BCI), while 955 individuals constituted the control group. A generalized estimating equation was employed to measure differences in repeated measures for both groups. The beta coefficients were reported after adjusting the covariates with the 95% confidence interval, and the p-value was considered significant at <0.050. Cohen's d was employed to report the effect size of the intervention. The BCI resulted in a 0.176-unit (95% CI 0.078-0.274, p-value <0.001) increase in knowledge scores regarding the health hazards of SLT and BQ, a 0.141-unit (95% CI 0.090-0.192, p-value <0.001) increase in use perception scores, and a 0.067-unit (95% CI 0.006-0.129, p-value 0.031) increase in quit perception scores in the intervention group compared with those in the control group. A knowledge related module (p-value 0.024) and quit preparation module (p-value 0.005) were found to be helpful by adolescents in either changing their perceptions regarding SLT and/or BQ chew use or in quitting. The role of BCI is promising in improving adolescents' knowledge and changing their perceptions in a positive manner regarding their harmful SLT and BQ use. Convincing results may be achieved if interventions are tailored, with an emphasis on the identification of the products that are used by adolescents in addition to highlighting their ill effects and how students may manage to quit them. If included in the schools' curricula, this BCI method may help in developing schools that are free of SLT and BQ use.

TI Applying particle filtering in both aggregated and age-structured
   population compartmental models of pre-vaccination measles
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID EPIDEMICS; DYNAMICS; CHAOS
AB Measles is a highly transmissible disease and is one of the leading causes of death among young children under 5 globally. While the use of ongoing surveillance data and-recently- dynamic models offer insight on measles dynamics, both suffer notable shortcomings when applied to measles outbreak prediction. In this paper, we apply the Sequential Monte Carlo approach of particle filtering, incorporating reported measles incidence for Saskatchewan during the pre-vaccination era, using an adaptation of a previously contributed measles compartmental model. To secure further insight, we also perform particle filtering on an age structured adaptation of the model in which the population is divided into two interacting age groups-children and adults. The results indicate that, when used with a suitable dynamic model, particle filtering can offer high predictive capacity for measles dynamics and outbreak occurrence in a low vaccination context. We have investigated five particle filtering models in this project. Based on the most competitive model as evaluated by predictive accuracy, we have performed prediction and outbreak classification analysis. The prediction results demonstrate that this model could predict measles outbreak evolution and classify whether there will be an outbreak or not in the next month (Area under the ROC Curve of 0.89). We conclude that anticipating the outbreak dynamics of measles in low vaccination regions by applying particle filtering with simple measles transmission models, and incorporating time series of reported case counts, is a valuable technique to assist public health authorities in estimating risk and magnitude of measles outbreaks. It is to be emphasized that particle filtering supports estimation of (via sampling from) the entire state of the dynamic model-both latent and observable-for each point in time. Such approach offers a particularly strong value proposition for other pathogens with little-known dynamics, critical latent drivers, and in the context of the growing number of high-velocity electronic data sources. Strong additional benefits are also likely to be realized from extending the application of this technique to highly vaccinated populations.

TI A study on Chinese consumer preferences for food traceability

AB Food safety is a global public health issue, which often arises from asymmetric information between consumers and suppliers. With the development of information technology in human life, building a food traceability information sharing platform is viewed as one of the best ways to overcome the trust crisis and resolve the problem of information asymmetry in China. However, among the myriad information available from the food supply chain, there is a lack of knowledge on consumer preference. Based on the best-worst scaling approach, this paper investigated consumer preferences for vegetable, pork, and dairy product traceability information. Specifically, this paper measured the relative importance that consumers place on the traceable information. The results indicate that consumers have varying priorities for information in different cases. "Pesticide/veterinary use," "picking/slaughtering date," and "fertilizer/feed use" are the most preferred traceable information for Chinese consumers in the case of vegetables, while "picking/slaughtering date" and "history of illness and taking protective measures" are the most preferred information in the case of pork. In the case of dairy products, consumers prefer "processing information," "environmental information of the origin," and "traceable tag certification information" most. The results of this study call for the direct involvement of the Chinese government in the food safety information sharing system as following. First, given consumers' diverse preferences, different types of traceable information should be recorded into the information sharing platform depending on food types. Second, the government could promote the step-by-step construction of such a platform based on the priority of consumers' preferences. Third, new technology should be applied to guarantee the reliability of traceable information. Finally, local preferences in terms of the way consumers receive and understand information should be taken into consideration.

TI Parental perceptions of onsite hospital food outlets in a large hospital
   in the North East of England: A qualitative interview study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID VENDING MACHINES; ENVIRONMENT; HEALTH; NUTRITION; POLICY
AB Background
   Addressing the increasing obesity rates in children living in the United Kingdom has become a priority. A public health level approach as opposed to an individual approach is potentially one way forward. The wider food environment should be designed so that the 'healthier choice' is the easiest choice; this includes public sector settings such as hospitals. Many hospital outlets sell and promote food and drinks high in sugar, fat and salt undermining health messages developed by the UK National Health Service. Financial incentives have been provided to encourage hospitals to promote healthier food choices; however, few outlets have complied with the targets.
   The aim of this qualitative interview study was to determine the dietary perceptions and needs of parents whose children attend a large children's hospital in the North East of England and to identify potential barriers and facilitators to eating healthily in a hospital setting.
   Methods
   Eighteen parents whose children attended the hospital as an in- or out-patient were recruited through either ward research nurses, information posters or a parent hospital Facebook page to participate in a one-to-one in-depth interview.
   Results
   Parents reported a lack of affordable healthy options for sale both for themselves and visiting children. Although parents wanted to see more healthy options available for sale they did not feel it was appropriate to ban or restrict sales of any food types. Parents of frequent or long-term in-patients found it difficult to adequately feed themselves.
   Conclusions
   The ways in which visitors and staff can be encouraged to choose the healthier option in an NHS hospital setting warrants further investigation. The use of 'nudge theory', which has gained particular momentum in areas such as health promotion, may be a tool which can be utilised by hospitals to facilitate the promotion of healthy eating.

AB BackgroundClassification of pathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) has traditionally relied on detecting specific virulence associated genes (VAGs) or combinations thereof. For E. coli isolated from faecal samples, the presence of specific genes associated with different intestinal pathogenic pathovars will determine their classification and further course of action. However, the E. coli genome is not a static entity, and hybrid strains are emerging that cross the pathovar definitions. Hybrid strains may show gene contents previously associated with several distinct pathovars making the correct diagnostic classification difficult. We extended the analysis of routinely submitted faecal isolates to include known virulence associated genes that are usually not examined in faecal isolates to detect the frequency of possible hybrid strains.MethodsFrom September 2012 to February 2013, 168 faecal isolates of E. coli routinely submitted to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) from clinical microbiological laboratories throughout Norway were analysed for 33 VAGs using multiplex-PCR, including factors associated with extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) strains. The strains were further typed by Multiple Locus Variable-Number Tandem-Repeat Analysis (MLVA), and the phylogenetic grouping was determined. One isolate from the study was selected for whole genome sequencing (WGS) with a combination of Oxford Nanopore's MinION and Illumina's MiSeq.ResultsThe analysis showed a surprisingly high number of strains carrying ExPEC associated VAGs and strains carrying a combination of both intestinal pathogenic E. coli (IPEC) and ExPEC VAGs. In particular, 93.5% (101/108) of isolates classified as belonging to an IPEC pathovar additionally carried ExPEC VAGs. WGS analysis of a selected hybrid strain revealed that it could, with present classification criteria, be classified as belonging to all of the Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), Neonatal meningitis Escherichia coli (NMEC) and Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) pathovars.ConclusionHybrid ExPEC/IPEC E. coli strains were found at a very high frequency in faecal samples and were in fact the predominant species present. A sequenced hybrid isolate was confirmed to be a cross-pathovar strain possessing recognised hallmarks of several pathovars, and a genome heavily influenced by horizontal gene transfer.

TI Hydrometeorology and flood pulse dynamics drive diarrheal disease
   outbreaks and increase vulnerability to climate change in
   surface-water-dependent populations: A retrospective analysis
SO PLOS MEDICINE

   RIVER; IMPACT; COAGULATION; ETIOLOGIES; SEDIMENT; BOTSWANA; SURVIVAL
AB Background
   The impacts of climate change on surface water, waterborne disease, and human health remain a growing area of concern, particularly in Africa, where diarrheal disease is one of the most important health threats to children under 5 years of age. Little is known about the role of surface water and annual flood dynamics (flood pulse) on waterborne disease and human health nor about the expected impact of climate change on surface-water-dependent populations.
   Methods and findings
   Using the Chobe River in northern Botswana, a flood pulse river-floodplain system, we applied multimodel inference approaches assessing the influence of river height, water quality (bimonthly counts of Escherichia coli and total suspended solids [TSS], 2011-2017), and meteorological variability on weekly diarrheal case reports among children under 5 presenting to health facilities (n = 10 health facilities, January 2007-June 2017). We assessed diarrheal cases by clinical characteristics and season across age groups using monthly outpatient data (January 1998-June 2017). A strong seasonal pattern was identified, with 2 outbreaks occurring regularly in the wet and dry seasons. The timing of outbreaks diverged from that at the level of the country, where surface water is largely absent. Across age groups, the number of diarrheal cases was greater, on average, during the dry season. Demographic and clinical characteristics varied by season, underscoring the importance of environmental drivers. In the wet season, rainfall (8-week lag) had a significant influence on under-5 diarrhea, with a 10-mm increase in rainfall associated with an estimated 6.5% rise in the number of cases. Rainfall, minimum temperature, and river height were predictive of E. coli concentration, and increases in E. coli in the river were positively associated with diarrheal cases. In the dry season, river height (1-week lag) and maximum temperature (1 - and 4-week lag) were significantly associated with diarrheal cases. During this period, a 1-meter drop in river height corresponded to an estimated 16.7% and 16.1% increase in reported diarrhea with a 1- and 4-week lag, respectively. In this region, as floodwaters receded from the surrounding floodplains, TSS levels increased and were positively associated with diarrheal cases (0- and 3-week lag). Populations living in this region utilized improved water sources, suggesting that hydrological variability and rapid water quality shifts in surface waters may compromise water treatment processes. Limitations include the potential influence of health beliefs and health seeking behaviors on data obtained through passive surveillance.
   Conclusions
   In flood pulse river-floodplain systems, hydrology and water quality dynamics can be highly variable, potentially impacting conventional water treatment facilities and the production of safe drinking water. In Southern Africa, climate change is predicted to intensify hydrological variability and the frequency of extreme weather events, amplifying the public health threat of waterborne disease in surface-water-dependent populations. Water sector development should be prioritized with urgency, incorporating technologies that are robust to local environmental conditions and expected climate-driven impacts. In populations with high HIV burdens, expansion of diarrheal disease surveillance and intervention strategies may also be needed. As annual flood pulse processes are predominantly influenced by climate controls in distant regions, country-level data may be inadequate to refine predictions of climate- health interactions in these systems.

TI Automated detection of moderate and large pneumothorax on frontal chest
   X-rays using deep convolutional neural networks: A retrospective study
SO PLOS MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID DIGITAL RADIOGRAPHY; CLASSIFICATION
AB Background
   Pneumothorax can precipitate a life-threatening emergency due to lung collapse and respiratory or circulatory distress. Pneumothorax is typically detected on chest X-ray; however, treatment is reliant on timely review of radiographs. Since current imaging volumes may result in long worklists of radiographs awaiting review, an automated method of prioritizing X-rays with pneumothorax may reduce time to treatment. Our objective was to create a large human-annotated dataset of chest X-rays containing pneumothorax and to train deep convolutional networks to screen for potentially emergent moderate or large pneumothorax at the time of image acquisition.
   Methods and findings
   In all, 13,292 frontal chest X-rays (3,107 with pneumothorax) were visually annotated by radiologists. This dataset was used to train and evaluate multiple network architectures. Images showing large- or moderate-sized pneumothorax were considered positive, and those with trace or no pneumothorax were considered negative. Images showing small pneumothorax were excluded from training. Using an internal validation set (n = 1,993), we selected the 2 top-performing models; these models were then evaluated on a held-out internal test set based on area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV). The final internal test was performed initially on a subset with small pneumothorax excluded (as in training; n = 1,701), then on the full test set (n = 1,990), with small pneumothorax included as positive. External evaluation was performed using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ChestX-ray14 set, a public dataset labeled for chest pathology based on text reports. All images labeled with pneumothorax were considered positive, because the NIH set does not classify pneumothorax by size. In internal testing, our "high sensitivity model" produced a sensitivity of 0.84 (95% CI 0.78-0.90), specificity of 0.90 (95% CI 0.89-0.92), and AUC of 0.94 for the test subset with small pneumothorax excluded. Our "high specificity model" showed sensitivity of 0.80 (95% CI 0.72-0.86), specificity of 0.97 (95% CI 0.96-0.98), and AUC of 0.96 for this set. PPVs were 0.45 (95% CI 0.39-0.51) and 0.71 (95% CI 0.63-0.77), respectively. Internal testing on the full set showed expected decreased performance (sensitivity 0.55, specificity 0.90, and AUC 0.82 for high sensitivity model and sensitivity 0.45, specificity 0.97, and AUC 0.86 for high specificity model). External testing using the NI H dataset showed some further performance decline (sensitivity 0.28-0.49, specificity 0.85-0.97, and AUC 0.75 for both). Due to labeling differences between internal and external datasets, these findings represent a preliminary step towards external validation.
   Conclusions
   We trained automated classifiers to detect moderate and large pneumothorax in frontal chest X-rays at high levels of performance on held-out test data. These models may provide a high specificity screening solution to detect moderate or large pneumothorax on images collected when human review might be delayed, such as overnight. They are not intended for unsupervised diagnosis of all pneumothoraces, as many small pneumothoraces (and some larger ones) are not detected by the algorithm. Implementation studies are warranted to develop appropriate, effective clinician alerts for the potentially critical finding of pneumothorax, and to assess their impact on reducing time to treatment.

TI Variable generalization performance of a deep learning model to detect
   pneumonia in chest radiographs: A cross-sectional study
SO PLOS MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID DIABETIC-RETINOPATHY; DISEASES; VALIDATION
AB Background
   There is interest in using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze medical imaging to provide computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Recent work has suggested that image classification CNNs may not generalize to new data as well as previously believed. We assessed how well CNNs generalized across three hospital systems for a simulated pneumonia screening task.
   Methods and findings
   A cross-sectional design with multiple model training cohorts was used to evaluate model generalizability to external sites using split-sample validation. A total of 158,323 chest radiographs were drawn from three institutions: National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (NIH; 112,120 from 30,805 patients), Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH; 42,396 from 12,904 patients), and Indiana University Network for Patient Care (IU; 3,807 from 3,683 patients). These patient populations had an age mean (SD) of 46.9 years (16.6), 63.2 years (16.5), and 49.6 years (17) with a female percentage of 43.5%, 44.8%, and 57.3%, respectively. We assessed individual models using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for radiographic findings consistent with pneumonia and compared performance on different test sets with DeLong's test. The prevalence of pneumonia was high enough at MSH (34.2%) relative to NIH and IU (1.2% and 1.0%) that merely sorting by hospital system achieved an AUC of 0.861 (95% CI 0.855-0.866) on the joint MSH-NIH dataset. Models trained on data from either NIH or MSH had equivalent performance on IU (Pvalues 0.580 and 0.273, respectively) and inferior performance on data from each other relative to an internal test set (i.e., new data from within the hospital system used for training data; Pvalues both <0.001). The highest internal performance was achieved by combining training and test data from MSH and NIH (AUC 0.931, 95% CI 0.927-0.936), but this model demonstrated significantly lower external performance at IU (AUC 0.815, 95% CI 0.7450.885, P= 0.001). To test the effect of pooling data from sites with disparate pneumonia prevalence, we used stratified subsampling to generate MSH-NIH cohorts that only differed in disease prevalence between training data sites. When both training data sites had the same pneumonia prevalence, the model performed consistently on external IU data (P= 0.88). When a 10-fold difference in pneumonia rate was introduced between sites, internal test performance improved compared to the balanced model (10x MSH risk P < 0.001; 10x NIH P = 0.002), but this outperformance failed to generalize to IU (MSH 10x P< 0.001; NIH 10x P= 0.027). CNNs were able to directly detect hospital system of a radiograph for 99.95% NIH (22,050/22,062) and 99.98% MSH (8,386/8,388) radiographs. The primary limitation of our approach and the available public data is that we cannot fully assess what other factors might be contributing to hospital system-specific biases.
   Conclusion
   Pneumonia-screening CNNs achieved better internal than external performance in 3 out of 5 natural comparisons. When models were trained on pooled data from sites with different pneumonia prevalence, they performed better on new pooled data from these sites but not on external data. CNNs robustly identified hospital system and department within a hospital, which can have large differences in disease burden and may confound predictions.

TI Vertical transmission of naturally occurring Bunyamwera and

   mainland shores of Lakes Victoria and Baringo in Kenya
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES

AB Background
   Many arboviruses transmitted by mosquitoes have been implicated as causative agents of both human and animal illnesses in East Africa. Although epidemics of arboviral emerging infectious diseases have risen in frequency in recent years, the extent to which mosquitoes maintain pathogens in circulation during inter-epidemic periods is still poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate whether arboviruses may be maintained by vertical transmission via immature life stages of different mosquito vector species.
   Methodology
   We collected immature mosquitoes (egg, larva, pupa) on the shores and islands of Lake Baringo and Lake Victoria in western Kenya and reared them to adults. Mosquito pools (<= 25 specimens/pool) of each species were screened for mosquito-borne viruses by high-resolution melting analysis and sequencing of multiplex PCR products of genus-specific primers (alphaviruses, flaviviruses, phleboviruses and Bunyamwera-group orthobunya-viruses). We further confirmed positive samples by culturing in baby hamster kidney and Aedes mosquito cell lines and re-sequencing.
   Principal findings
   Culex univittatus (2/31pools) and Anopheles gambiae (1/77 pools) from the Lake Victoria region were positive for Bunyamwera virus, a pathogenic virus that is of public health concern. In addition, Aedes aegypti (3/50), Aedes luteocephalus (3/13), Aedes spp. (2/15), and Culex pipiens (1/140) pools were positive for Aedes flaviviruses at Lake Victoria, whereas at Lake Baringo, three pools of An. gambiae mosquitoes were positive for Anopheles flavivirus. These insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFVs), which are presumably non-pathogenic to vertebrates, were found in known medically important arbovirus and malaria vectors.
   Conclusions
   Our results suggest that not only ISFVs, but also a pathogenic arbovirus, are naturally maintained within mosquito populations by vertical transmission, even in the absence of vertebrate hosts. Therefore, virus and vector surveillance, even during inter-epidemics, and the study of vector-arbovirus-ISFV interactions, may aid in identifying arbovirus transmission risks, with the potential to inform control strategies that lead to disease prevention.

AB Background
   Mass anthelmintic drug administration is recommended in developing countries to address infection by soil-transmitted helminthiases (STH). We quantified the public health benefit of treatment with mebendazole in eight million Vietnamese children aged 5-14 years from 2006 to 2011. This was compared to the environmental impact of the pharmaceutical supply chain of mebendazole, as the resource use and emissions associated with pharmaceutical production can be associated with a public health burden, e.g. through emissions of fine particulate matter.
   Methodology
   Through Markov modelling the disability due to STH was quantified for hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura. For each worm type, four levels of intensity of infection were included: none, light, medium and heavy. The treatment effect on patients was quantified in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). The public health burden induced by the pharmaceutical supply chain of mebendazole was quantified in DALYs through Life Cycle Assessment.
   Principal findings
   Compared to 'no treatment', the modelled results of five-year treatment averted 116,587 DALYs (68% reduction) for the three worms combined and largely driven by A. lumbricoides. The main change in DALYs occurred in the first year of treatment, after which the results stabilized. The public health burden associated with the pharmaceutical supply chain was 6 DALYs.
   Conclusions
   The public health benefit of the Mass Drug Administration (MDA) averted substantially more DALYs than those induced by the pharmaceutical supply chain. These results were verified in a sensitivity analysis. The starting prevalence for each worm was the most sensitive model parameter. This methodology is useful for policymakers interested in a holistic approach towards the public health performance of MDA programs, enveloping both the treatment benefit received by the patient and the public health burden associated with the resource consumption and environmental emissions of the pharmaceutical production and supply chain.

AB In China, thirteen species of tick-borne rickettsiales bacteria pathogenic to human have been reported in ticks and host animals, and human patients caused by them also has been identified. However, investigation for rickettsiales bacteria circulating in Xi'an wasn't performed although diseases resembling human diseases caused by these organisms have been found. In this study, domestic animals and ticks in Xi'an, China, were tested for the presence of rickettsiales bacteria pathogenic to humans. Besides A. ovis, a high prevalence of A. capra was observed suggesting a high public health risk exists. In addition, two novel Anaplasma species closely related to A. phagocytophilum were identified and formed distinct lineages in the phylogenetic trees, with more than 98.3% identities for rrs gene, while divergences up to 20.2% and 37.0% for groEL and gltA genes, respectively. Both of these two novel Anaplasma species were found to circulate in goats and further assessment of their pathogenicity is needed. Ca. R. jingxinensis, with potential pathogenicity, was also detected in H. longicomis ticks with high prevalence. However, other causative agents were not identified although they were distributed in other areas of China.

AB Background
   Enteric infections are common where public health infrastructure is lacking. This study assesses risk factors for a range of enteric infections among children living in low-income, unplanned communities of urban Maputo, Mozambique.
   Methods & findings
   We conducted a cross-sectional survey in 17 neighborhoods of Maputo to assess the prevalence of reported diarrheal illness and laboratory-confirmed enteric infections in children. We collected stool from children aged 1-48 months, independent of reported symptoms, for molecular detection of 15 common enteric pathogens by multiplex RT-PCR. We also collected survey and observational data related to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) characteristics; other environmental factors; and social, economic, and demographic covariates.
   We analyzed stool from 759 children living in 425 household clusters (compounds) representing a range of environmental conditions. We detected >= 1 enteric pathogens in stool from most children (86%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 84-89%) though diarrheal symptoms were only reported for 16% (95% CI: 13-19%) of children with enteric infections and 13% (95% CI: 11-15%) of all children. Prevalence of any enteric infection was positively associated with age and ranged from 71% (95% CI: 64-77%) in children 1-11 months to 96% (95% CI: 93-98%) in children 24-48 months. We found poor sanitary conditions, such as presence of feces or soiled diapers around the compound, to be associated with higher risk of protozoan infections. Certain latrine features, including drop-hole covers and latrine walls, and presence of a water tap on the compound grounds were associated with a lower risk of bacterial and protozoan infections. Any breastfeeding was also associated with reduced risk of infection.
   Conclusions
   We found a high prevalence of enteric infections, primarily among children without diarrhea, and weak associations between bacterial and protozoan infections and environmental risk factors including WASH. Findings suggest that environmental health interventions to limit infections would need to be transformative given the high prevalence of enteric pathogen shedding and poor sanitary conditions observed.

TI Use of anthropophilic culicid-based xenosurveillance as a proxy for
   Plasmodium vivax malaria burden and transmission hotspots identification

AB Vector-borne diseases account for more than 17% of all infectious diseases, causing more than one million deaths annually. Malaria remains one of the most important public health problems worldwide. These vectors are bloodsucking insects, which can transmit disease-producing microorganisms during a blood meal. The contact of culicids with human populations living in malaria-endemic areas suggests that the identification of Plasmodium genetic material in the blood present in the gut of these mosquitoes may be possible. The process of assessing the blood meal for the presence of pathogens is termed 'xenosurveillance'. In view of this, the present work investigated the relationship between the frequency with which Plasmodium DNA is found in culicids and the frequency with which individuals are found to be carrying malaria parasites. A cross-sectional study was performed in a peri-urban area of Manaus, in the Western Brazilian Amazon, by simultaneously collecting human blood samples and trapping culicids from households. A total of 875 individuals were included in the study and a total of 13,374mosquito specimens were captured. Malaria prevalence in the study area was 7.7%. The frequency of households with at least one culicid specimen carrying Plasmodium DNA was 6.4%. Plasmodium infection incidence was significantly related to whether any Plasmodium positive blood-fed culicid was found in the same household [IRR 3.49 (CI95% 1.38-8.84); p = 0.008] and for indoor-collected culicids [IRR 4.07 (CI95% 1.25-13.24); p = 0.020]. Furthermore, the number of infected people in the house at the time of mosquito collection was related to whether there were any positive blood-fed culicid mosquitoes in that household for collection methods combined [IRR 4.48 (CI95% 2.22-9.05); p<0.001] or only for indoor-collected culicids [IRR 4.88 (CI95%2.01-11.82); p<0.001]. Our results suggest that xenosurveillance can be used in endemic tropical regions in order to estimate the malaria burden and identify transmission foci in areas where Plasmodium vivax is predominant.

TI Continuing evidence of Chagas disease along the Texas-Mexico border
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article

   PREVALENCE; HEALTH; CARE
AB Background
   Chagas disease is a chronic parasitic infection that progresses to dilated cardiomyopathy in 30% of human cases. Public health efforts target diagnosing asymptomatic cases, as therapeutic efficacy diminishes as irreversible tissue damage progresses. Physician diagnosis of Chagas disease cases in the United States is low, partially due to lack of awareness of the potential burden in the United States.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   The current study tested a patient cohort of 1,196 Starr County, Texas residents using the Hemagen Chagas ELISA Kit as a preliminary screening assay. Samples testing positive using the Hemagen test were subjected to additional confirmatory tests. Two patients (0.17%) without previous Chagas disease diagnosis were identified; both had evidence of acquiring disease in the United States or along the Texas-Mexico border.
   Conclusions/Significance
   The Texas-Mexico border is a foci of Chagas disease human cases, with a local disease burden potentially twice the national estimate of Hispanic populations. It is imperative that physicians consider persons with residential histories along the Texas-Mexico border for Chagas disease testing.

SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES

DT Article
ID EPIDEMIOLOGY; CONSENSUS; GENOTYPE
AB Chagas disease is still a major public health issue in many Latin American countries. One of the current major challenges is to find an association between Trypanosoma cruzi discrete typing units (DTUs) and clinical manifestations of the disease. In this study, we used a multilocus conventional PCR and quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) approaches to perform the molecular typing and parasite load quantification directly from blood specimens of 65 chronic Chagas disease patients. All patients were recruited at the same health center, but their place of birth were widely distributed in different geographic regions of Brazil. Of the 65 patients, 35(53.8%) presented positive amplification by real time qPCR, being 20 (30.7%) with the clinical indeterminate form and 15 (23.1%) with the cardiac form of the disease. The parasite load median for all positive patients was 2.54 [1.43-11.14] parasite equivalents/mL (par. Eq./mL), with the load ranging from 0.12 to 153.66 par. Eq./mL. Noteworthy, the parasite load was significantly higher in patients over 70 years old (median 20.05 [18.29-86.86] par. Eq./mL). Using guanidine-EDTA blood samples spiked with reference T. cruzi strains, belonging to the six DTUs, it was possible to genotype the parasite up to 0.5 par. Eq./mL, with high specificity. Of the patients with positive qPCR, it was possible to identify the T. cruzi DTU in 28 patients (80%). For the remaining patients (20%), at least a partial result was obtained. Analysis of specimens showed prevalences of TcVI, TcII and mixed infection TcVI+TcII equal to 40%, 17.1% and 14.3%, respectively. In addition, two patients were infected by TcV, and one patient was coinfected by TcIII+TcVI, These last three patients were in stage A of chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC), and they were born at the Bahia State (northeast region of Brazil). When T. cruzi genotypes were compared with the parasite load, more elevated parasite loads were observed in patients infected by TcII in general (parasite load median of 7.56 par. Eq./mL) in comparison to patients infected by TcVI (median of 2.35 par. Eq./mL). However, while the frequency of CCC was 50% in patients infected by TcVI and TcV, only 16.7% of patients infected by TcII evolved to CCC. Taking together, our results contribute to update the epidemiological knowledge of T. cruzi DTUs in Brazil, and highlight the age of patient and infection by TcII as important features that lead to the observation of higher parasitemia levels.

AB Dengue is the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease of humans and is caused by the four serotypes of dengue virus. To estimate the incidence of dengue and other arboviruses, we analyzed the baseline and first year follow-up of a prospective school-based cohort study and their families in three cities in the state of Yucatan, Mexico. Through enhanced surveillance activities, acute febrile illnesses in the participants were detected and yearly blood samples were collected to evaluate dengue infection incidence. A Cox model was fitted to identify hazard ratios of arboviral infections in the first year of follow-up of the cohort. The incidence of dengue symptomatic infections observed during the first year of follow-up (2015-2016) was 3.5 cases per 1,000 person-years (95% CI: 1.9, 5.9). The incidence of dengue infections was 33.9 infections per 1,000 person-years (95% CI: 31.7, 48.0). The majority of dengue infections and seroconversions were observed in the younger age groups (<= 14 years old). Other arboviruses were circulating in the state of Yucatan during the study period. The incidence of symptomatic chikungunya infections was 8.6 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI: 5.8, 12.3) and the incidence of symptomatic Zika infections was 2.3 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI: 0.9, 4.5). Our model shows that having a dengue infection during the first year of follow-up was significantly associated with being female, living in Ticul or Progreso, and being dengue naive at baseline. Age was not significantly associated with the outcome, it was confounded by prior immunity to dengue that increases with age. This is the first report of a cohort in Latin America that provides incidence estimates of the three arboviruses co-circulating in all age groups. This study provides important information for understanding the epidemiology of dengue and other arboviruses and better informing public health policies.

TI Comprehensive evaluation of stool-based diagnostic methods and
   benzimidazole resistance markers to assess drug efficacy and detect the
   emergence of anthelmintic resistance: A Starworms study protocol
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES

AB Background
   To work towards reaching the WHO goal of eliminating soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections as a public health problem, the total number of children receiving anthelmintic drugs has strongly increased over the past few years. However, as drug pressure levels rise, the development of anthelmintic drug resistance (AR) is more and more likely to appear. Currently, any global surveillance system to monitor drug efficacy and the emergence of possible AR is lacking. Consequently, it remains unclear to what extent the efficacy of drugs may have dropped and whether AR is already present. The overall aim of this study is to recommend the best diagnostic methods to monitor drug efficacy and molecular markers to assess the emergence of AR in STH control programs.
   Methods
   A series of drug efficacy trials will be performed in four STH endemic countries with varying drug pressure (Ethiopia and Brazil: low drug pressure, Lao PDR: moderate drug pressure and Tanzania: high drug pressure). These trials are designed to assess the efficacy of a single oral dose of 400 mg albendazole (ALB) against STH infections in school-aged children (SAC) by microscopic (duplicate Kato-Katz thick smear, Mini-FLOTAC and FECPAK(G2)) and molecular stool-based diagnostic methods (quantitative PCR (qPCR)). Data will be collected on the cost of the materials used, as well as the time required to prepare and examine stool samples for the different diagnostic methods. Following qPCR, DNA samples will also be submitted for pyrosequencing to assess the presence and prevalence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the beta-tubulin gene. These SNPs are known to be linked to AR in animal STHs.
   Discussion
   The results obtained by these trials will provide robust evidence regarding the cost-efficiency and diagnostic performance of the different stool-based diagnostic methods for the assessment of drug efficacy in control programs. The assessment of associations between the frequency of SNPs in the beta-tubulin gene and the history of drug pressure and drug efficacy will allow the validation of these SNPs as a marker for AR in human STHs.

AB BackgroundOne third of older people are estimated to die with dementia, which is a principal cause of death in developed countries. While it is assumed that people die with severe dementia this is not based on evidence.MethodsCohort study using a large secondary mental healthcare database in North London, UK. We included people aged over 65years, diagnosed with dementia between 2008 and 2016, who subsequently died. We estimated dementia severity using mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores, adjusting for the time between last score and death using the average annual MMSE decline in the cohort (1.5 points/year). We explored the association of sociodemographic and clinical factors, including medication use, with estimated MMSE score at death using linear regression.ResultsIn 1400 people dying with dementia, mean estimated MMSE at death was 15.3 (standard deviation 7.0). Of the cohort, 22.2% (95% confidence interval 20.1, 24.5) died with mild dementia; 50.4% (47.8, 53.0) moderate; and 27.4% (25.1, 29.8) with severe dementia.In fully adjusted models, more severe dementia at death was observed in women, Black, Asian and other ethnic minorities, agitated individuals, and those taking antipsychotic medication.ConclusionsOnly one quarter of people who die with dementia are at the severe stage of the illness. This finding informs clinical and public understanding of dementia prognosis. Provision of end-of-life services should account for this and healthcare professionals should be aware of high rates of mild and moderate dementia at end of life and consider how this affects clinical decision-making.

ID PREVALENCE
AB IntroductionAnemia is defined as a low blood hemoglobin concentration (<11mg/dl). It is a global public health problem especially in pregnant women and is associated with higher risk for both maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. In developing countries, like Ethiopia where anemia is common, determining the magnitude and identifying factors that are associated with anemia is necessary to control it.MethodsFacility based cross sectional study design were conducted among 638 pregnant women attending antenatal care in public health centers in central zone of Tigray region, Northern Ethiopia from November 1/2017 to January 30/2018 using stratified multi stage sampling method. The data was collected through interviewing the pregnant women face to face after getting informed consent using structured and pre-tested questionnaire. The data was coded and entered in to Epi-info 7 then exported to Stata 14 for cleaning and further analysis. Both Bivariable and multi variable logistic regression model was used in the data analysis.ResultsThe overall magnitude of anemia (hemoglobin level<11mg/dl) were found that 16.88% (95% CI: 13.95%, 19.8%). Factors which were significantly associated with anemia in the multivariable analysis were: history of malaria attack 1 year prior to study period (AOR=4.73, 95% CI: 2.64, 8.46), women who had history of excessive menstrual bleeding (AOR=3.94, 95% CI: 2.11, 7.35), unplanned pregnancy (AOR=2.5, 95% CI: 1.4, 4.42) and three times or less meal frequency (AOR=1.89, 95% CI: 1.02, 3.5).ConclusionThe magnitude of anemia among pregnant were found that 16.88%. Malaria attack, excessive menstrual bleeding, pregnancy planning and meal frequency were found that significantly associated with anemia in the multivariable analysis. Pregnant women are recommended to increase meal frequency. Health providers should give attention to pregnant women who had history of malaria attack, excessive menstrual bleeding and women whose pregnancy were not planned.

AB Objectives
   To develop and examine the content and face validity of the Patient Engagement In Research Scale (PEIRS) for assessing the quality of patient engagement in research projects from a patient partner perspective.
   Methods
   Our team of researchers and patient partners conducted a mixed qualitative and quantitative study in three phases. Participants were English-speaking adult patients (including informal caregivers, family members, and friends) with varying experiences as partners in research projects in Canada. 1) Questionnaire items were generated following thematic analysis of in-depth interviews and published literature. 2) A three-round e-Delphi survey process via email correspondence was undertaken to refine and select the items for a provisional PEIRS. 3) Two rounds of cognitive interviewing elicited participants' understanding and opinions of each item and the structure of the PEIRS.
   Results
   One hundred and twenty items were generated from 18 interviews and organized across eight themes of meaningful engagement of patients in health research to form an initial questionnaire. The e-Delphi survey and cognitive interviewing each included 12 participants with a range of self-reported diseases, health-related conditions, and use of healthcare services. The e-Delphi survey yielded a 43-item provisional PEIRS. The PEIRS was then reduced to 37 items organized across seven themes after 1) refinement of problems in its instructions and items, and 2) the combining of two themes into one.
   Conclusions
   We developed a 37-item self-reported questionnaire that has demonstrated preliminary content and face validity for assessing the quality of patient engagement in research.

AB HIV disproportionately impacts transgender communities and the majority of new infections occur in the Southern United States. Yet, limited data exists on contextual realities of HIV vulnerability and healthcare needs among transgender individuals in the Deep South. Addressing this gap in the literature, we assess the health needs, including barriers and facilitators to accessing healthcare, including and beyond HIV, from the perspective of transgender men and women in Mississippi. Between June-August 2014, in-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews (n = 14) were conducted with adult transgender persons at an LGBT healthcare setting in Jackson, Mississippi. In-depth interviews lasted between 60-90 minutes and followed semi-structured format (themes probed: HIV vulnerability, healthcare needs, and availability of gender-affirming medical care). Audio files were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using Dedoose (v.6.1.18). Among participants (mean age = 23.3 years, standard deviation = 4.98), 43% identified as a transgender man or on a transmasculine spectrum, 43% as Black, and 21% self-reported living with HIV. HIV-related services were frequently described as the primary gateway to accessing healthcare needs. Nonetheless, participants' primary health concerns were: gender affirmation processes (hormones, silicone, binding/packing); mental health; and drug/alcohol use. Stigma and discrimination were commonly reported in healthcare settings and health-related information was primarily attained through social networks and online resources. Results highlight gender identity alongside race and pervasive marginalization as key social determinants of transgender health in Mississippi. As Mississippi is one of several states actively debating transgender access to public accommodations, findings underscore the need to treat transgender health as a holistic and multidimensional construct, including, but moving beyond, HIV prevention and care.

AB It is generally agreed that healthcare workers are ideally positioned to recognize and diagnose cases of elder abuse. However, little is known about their knowledge and understanding of this issue. The objective of this study was to assess and compare the perceptions of different groups of healthcare workers toward elder abuse in Japan, using the Knowledge-Attitude-Behavior (KAB) model. Home-visit nurses, medical doctors, care managers, care workers, public health nurses, and social workers, with experience of dealing with elder abuse received self-administered questionnaire surveys that inquired regarding demo-graphics, knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding elder abuse. A total of 311 healthcare workers participated in this survey. To compare the differences among the groups, a one-way analysis of variance with a post-hoc Tukey's test, and a Kruskal-Wallis with post-hoc Steel-Dwass tests were used in accordance with data normality. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to explore variables that predicted the healthcare workers' perceptions, and covariance structure analysis was used to examine whether the KAB model can accurately predict healthcare workers' perceptions. Multiple comparisons showed significant differences in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding elder abuse among the abovementioned six groups. Age, sex, and years of work related to the care of elderly were extracted as significant determinants of healthcare workers' perceptions of elder abuse. The examination of the KAB model with covariance structure analysis yielded a model with strong goodness-of-fit. These findings emphasize the need to take effective measures to improve their perceptions as well as review the role of each healthcare worker so that they can be more concerned with and involved in the safeguarding of the elderly. Given the strong goodness-of-fit demonstrated by the KAB model, education of healthcare workers on both the knowledge of, and attitudes toward, elder abuse may help in improving healthcare workers' behavior in dealing with elder abuse.

AB Background
   In the context of the national Cancer Plans of France that have changed the healthcare landscape, it has become necessary to better document and assess the related actions, and to promote research and understanding. The national cancer cohort, an exhaustive population-based cohort, was set up on the basis of the National Health Data System (SNDS) by the French National Cancer Institute.
   Objectives
   The aim is to describe the French national cancer cohort.
   Methods
   All people living in France (67 million population) with universal insurance coverage and diagnosed, treated or followed up for a cancer, such as survivors, are included and will be followed up for 25 years. It contains all healthcare consumptions and reimbursements (i.e. hospitalization, outpatient care, medication...) since 2010. Every year, around 650 000 new cases are included.
   Results
   From 2010 to 2015, 6.2 million subjects have been included. Most subjects were entered in 2010, in 2015 it concerned 0.6 million. In 2015, the median age was 65 [54-76]; 51% were women. The primary cancer organ could be attributed with certitude to 87% of the people. The most frequent locations were skin (16%), breast (15%), prostate (12%), colon-rectum (11%) and lung (9%). In 2015, 40% of included subjects underwent surgery for cancer, 16% chemotherapy at hospital and 11% at least one session of radiotherapy.
   Conclusion
   Based on SNDS, the cancer cohort has been designed to study cancer care use in the short-, medium- and long-term, and evaluate healthcare and public health policies.

AB Concerns about genetic privacy affect individuals' willingness to accept genetic testing in clinical care and to participate in genomics research. To learn what is already known about these views, we conducted a systematic review, which ultimately analyzed 53 studies involving the perspectives of 47,974 participants on real or hypothetical privacy issues related to human genetic data. Bibliographic databases included MEDLINE, Web of Knowledge, and Sociological Abstracts. Three investigators independently screened studies against predetermined criteria and assessed risk of bias. The picture of genetic privacy that emerges from this systematic literature review is complex and riddled with gaps. When asked specifically ''are you worried about genetic privacy, the general public, patients, and professionals frequently said yes. In many cases, however, that question was posed poorly or only in the most general terms. While many participants expressed concern that genomic and medical information would be revealed to others, respondents frequently seemed to conflate privacy, confidentiality, control, and security. People varied widely in how much control they wanted over the use of data. They were more concerned about use by employers, insurers, and the government than they were about researchers and commercial entities. In addition, people are often willing to give up some privacy to obtain other goods. Importantly, little attention was paid to understanding the factors - sociocultural, relational, and media - that influence people's opinions and decisions. Future investigations should explore in greater depth which concerns about genetic privacy are most salient to people and the social forces and contexts that influence those perceptions. It is also critical to identify the social practices that will make the collection and use of these data more trustworthy for participants as well as to identify the circumstances that lead people to set aside worries and decide to participate in research.

TI Integrating emergency risk communication (ERC) into the public health
   system response: Systematic review of literature to aid formulation of
   the 2017 WHO Guideline for ERC policy and practice
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Review
ID PREPAREDNESS; INFORMATION; INFLUENZA; CRISIS; H1N1
AB The World Health Organization (WHO) commissioned a systematic review of literature to facilitate evidence syntheses for the development of emergency risk communication (ERC) guidelines for its member states. The goal of this review was to integrate ERC best practices into governmental and non-governmental health systems for all emergencies of public health concern, by addressing three questions: (1) to identify best practices for the integration of ERC into national and international public health preparedness; (2) to identify mechanisms to establish effective intra-agency, inter-agency, and/or cross-jurisdictional information sharing; and (3) to identify methods to coordinate risk communication activities between responding agencies across organizations and levels of response. The review covered scientific and grey literature publications between January 2003 and February 2016, and searches were conducted in 17 English language electronic libraries besides Chinese, Portuguese and Spanish language databases. A mixed deductive-inductive process was used to synthesize findings across studies through identifying thematic areas. While 8,215 articles were initially retrieved, after a sequential screening process, the final evidence syntheses comprised of 21 articles for question (1) and 24 for questions (2) and (3) combined (due to overlap of themes). The confidence in findings was assessed by the Qualitative Evidence Syntheses (GRADE-CERQual) tool. PRISMA guidelines were followed to the extent possible given the limitations inherent to a review largely based on qualitative studies. The identified literature was very context-specific and referred to mechanisms, practices from the field, and recommendations that were derived from planning or response efforts implemented at the national or local levels in specific countries. Integration of ERC functions into public health emergency preparedness, planning and response activities was influenced by reforming components of the leadership structure when needed, modifying organizational factors, and nullifying restrictions (including amending laws/regulations) that might have been an obstacle to the timely release of information. Exercises and trainings were recognized as effective strategies to identify the barriers and successes in this process of integration. Key elements to enhance information sharing and coordination across organizations included the creation of networks, task-forces and committees across disciplines, organizations and geographic areas. Engagement of local stakeholders was also important to guarantee the flow of information up and down the incident command system. On the whole, few empirical studies, especially from low- and middle-income countries, related to the WHO research questions, demonstrating the need for research in these areas. To facilitate an accurate identification of the gaps, the authors suggest integrating current findings with case studies across the WHO regions to better understand the specific evidence that is needed in practice across the multitude of ERC functions.

TI Cause-specific mortality patterns among hospital deaths in Tanzania,
   2006-2015
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID BURDEN; INFECTION; DISEASE
AB Background
   Understanding the causes of inpatient mortality in hospitals is important for monitoring the population health and evidence-based planning for curative and public health care. Dearth of information on causes and trends of hospital mortality in most countries of Sub-Saharan Africa has resulted to wide use of model-based estimation methods which are characterized by estimation errors. This retrospective analysis used primary data to determine the cause-specific mortality patterns among inpatient hospital deaths in Tanzania from 2006-2015.
   Materials and methods
   The analysis was carried out from July to December 2016 and involved 39 hospitals in Tanzania. A review of hospital in-patient death registers and report forms was done to cover a period of 10 years. Information collected included demographic characteristics of the deceased and immediate underlying cause of death. Causes of death were coded using international classification of diseases (ICD)-10. Data were analysed to provide information on cause-specific, trends and distribution of death by demographic and geographical characteristics.
   Principal findings
   A total of 247,976 deaths were captured over a 10-year period. The median age at death was 30 years, interquartile range (IQR) 1, 50. The five leading causes of death were malaria (12.75%), respiratory diseases (10.08%), HIV/AIDS (8.04%), anaemia (7.78%) and cardiocirculatory diseases (6.31%). From 2006 to 2015, there was a noted decline in the number of deaths due to malaria (by 47%), HIV/AIDS (28%) and tuberculosis (26%). However, there was an increase in number of deaths due to neonatal disorders by 128%. Malaria and anaemia killed more infants and children under 5 years while HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis accounted for most of the deaths among adults.
   Conclusion
   The leading causes of inpatient hospital death were malaria, respiratory diseases, HIV/AIDS, anaemia and cardio-circulatory diseases. Death among children under 5 years has shown an increasing trend. The observed trends in mortality indicates that the country is lagging behind towards attaining the global and national goals for sustainable development. The increasing pattern of respiratory diseases, cancers and septicaemia requires immediate attention of the health system.

TI Attitudes towards domestic violence in 49 low- and middle-income
   countries: A gendered analysis of prevalence and country-level
   correlates
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE; SEXUAL VIOLENCE; WOMEN; DETERMINANTS; HEALTH
AB Background
   Violence against women by an intimate partner (DV) is a serious public health and human rights issue. Attitudes justifying DV strongly predict its perpetration and victimisation. This paper presents gendered ecological analyses of the societal acceptance of DV in 49 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) across geographical regions.
   Methods and findings
   We utilised data from 49 Demographic and Health Surveys conducted between 2005 and 2017, United Nations Statistics and topic-specific meta-databases. DV acceptance was measured as the justification of 'wife-beating' in at least one of five circumstances, and by the summative scale. Stepwise multiple linear regression examined country-level social, economic and political empowerment predictors of societal acceptance of DV amongst women, men, and the aggregate gender difference. Women were more likely than men to justify DV in Sub-Saharan Africa and South (east) Asia with societal acceptance of DV being more widespread in these regions compared with Latin America, the Caribbean, Central/ West Asia and Europe. Political conflict and limited economic rights for women were associated with higher levels of DV acceptance amongst women and men. Men in more democratic countries were less likely to justify DV. Amongst women, higher national female literacy rates predicted lower levels of justification. There were higher levels of DV acceptance amongst women and a wider aggregate gender difference in countries with a larger representation of women in national parliament.
   Conclusion
   Justification of DV is widespread amongst women and men in LMICs with acceptance rates varying across countries and regions. Gender differences in the impact of contextual factors on DV acceptance supports a gendered approach to national-level interventions. Our findings highlight the need for tailored interventions targeting DV acceptance in conflict- 8 impacted societies. The emphasis of inter(national) policies on the 'empowerment' domains of widely-used gender (in)equality indices need to be coupled with strategies tackling discriminatory gender norms.

AB BackgroundThe treatment of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis represents one of the most significant challenges to global health. Despite guidance on improving treatment outcomes, there is little focus on how to support individuals in their suffering. Palliative care is therefore proposed as a necessary component in the global strategy to fight Tuberculosis. We aim to describe the informal resources and networks available to persons affected by Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis, how they are accessed and how they are integrated into everyday lives.MethodsIn-depth ethnographic research was conducted in Bengaluru, India. Informal interactions and observations were recorded across a range of palliative care and tuberculosis treatment providers over a month-long period. In addition, ten individuals with Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis were asked for in-depth interviews, and five agreed.ResultsMultidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis caused a dynamic chain of events that transgress through physical and psychological domains to cause human suffering. Participants utilised support from their family and friends to build a network of care that was of therapeutic benefit. Informal care networks were similar to the holistic model of care practice by specialist palliative care services and represent an underused resource with enormous potential.ConclusionPatient suffering is poorly addressed in current Tuberculosis treatment programmes. A community-based palliative care approach may extend peoples' support networks, helping to alleviate suffering. Further research on existing support structures and integration of these services into Tuberculosis control programmes is required.

AB Background
   The availability of a skilled birth attendant is widely recognized as a critical factor in reducing maternal and newborn mortality. Competence of maternal healthcare providers directly affects quality of care and health outcomes. This study assessed competence of midwives and associated factors in provision of care during labor, and the immediate postpartum period at public health facilities in Tigray, Ethiopia.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional study design was employed to collect data through direct observation of the performance of 144 midwives selected from 57 health facilities. Data were collected from January to February 2015 by 12 experienced midwives who were trained on basic emergency obstetric care and had previous experience with data collection. Using a standardized competence checklist, adapted from International confederation of midwives, data collectors interviewed and directly observed the performance of midwives from admission of laboring mothers to six hours after delivery. Multivariable linear regression was used to identify predicators associated with overall clinical competence of midwives.
   Result
   The mean competence score of midwives was found to be 51%. In multivariable linear regression, male midwifery professionals (p = 0.022), availability of up to date job aids in work place (p = 0.04) and being recognized for improved performance (p = 0.005) were significantly associated with competence of midwives in the provision of care during labor, childbirth and immediate postpartum period.
   Conclusion
   Competence of midwives was found to be low to provide safe and quality maternity care in the region. Male gender, availability of complete job aids and receiving recognition/awards for better performance were predicted competence. This requires attention and investment from Tigray regional health bureau and health development partners working on maternal and child health. Competence based in-service training, on-the-job mentoring, availing up to dated standard job aids, recognition of high performing midwives are recommended to improve the quality of maternity care in public health facilities of the region. Moreover, affirmative actions including on-the-job training and supervision are needed to improve the competence of female midwives.

AB In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), epidemiological data for chronic kidney disease (CKD) are scarce. We conducted a prospective cross-sectional study including 952 patients in an outpatient clinic in Tanzania to explore CKD prevalence estimates and the association with cardiovascular and infectious disorders. According to KDIGO, we measured albumin-to-creatinine ratio and calculated eGFR using CKD-EPI formula. Factors associated with CKD were calculated by logistic regression. Venn diagrams were modelled to visualize interaction between associated factors and CKD. Overall, the estimated CKD prevalence was 13.6% (95% CI 11-16%). Ninety-eight patients (11.2%) (95% CI 9-14%) were categorized as moderate, 12 (1.4%) (95% CI 0-4%) as high, and 9 (1%) (95% CI 0-3%) as very high risk according to KDIGO. History of tuberculosis (OR 3.75, 95% CI 1.66-8.18; p = 0.001) and schistosomiasis (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.13-5.18; p = 0.02) were associated with CKD. A trend was seen for increasing systolic blood pressure (OR 1.02 per 1 mmHg, 95% CI 1.00-1.03; p = 0.01). Increasing BMI (OR 0.92 per 1kg/m(2), 95% CI 0.88-0.96; p = <0.001) and haemoglobin (OR 0.82 per 1g/dL, 95% CI 0.72-0.94; p = 0.004) were associated with risk reduction. Diabetes was associated with albuminuria (OR 2.81, 95% CI 1.26-6.00; p = 0.009). In 85% of all CKD cases at least one of the four most common factors (hypertension, diabetes, anaemia, and history of tuberculosis or schistosomiasis) was associated with CKD. A singular associated factor was found in 61%, two in 14%, and >= 3 in 10% of all CKD cases. We observed a high prevalence estimate for CKD and found that both classical cardiovascular and neglected infectious diseases might be associated with CKD in a semi-rural population of SSA. Our finding provides further evidence for the hypothesis that the "double burden" of non-communicable and endemic infectious diseases might affect kidney health in SSA.

TI Impact of an education intervention on knowledge of high school students
   concerning substance use in Kurdistan Region-Iraq: A quasi-experimental
   study
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID ALCOHOL; DRUGS
AB Background and aims
   Substance use among adolescents especially smoking, is becoming a public health problem in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. School-based health education is an appropriate approach for improving students' knowledge regarding substance use in an attempt to prevent or reduce such problem The purpose of the study was to examine the effect of an educational intervention for high school students to improve their knowledge for substance use and its negative consequences, which will, in turn, motivate students to take protective measures against substance use.
   Methods
   This quasi-experimental (one group; pre, and post-test) design was carried out in Erbil city from January 2017 to June 2017. A random sampling technique was employed to collect a sample of 280 students amongst four high schools in Erbil city which is the capital of Kurdistan Region-Iraq. A self- administered questionnaire on knowledge assessment regarding substance use was developed and validated by the experts regarding the relevance of the items. A structured teaching program for imparting knowledge on various aspects of substance use was developed based on extensive review of literature and experts' opinion. The intervention program consisted of a series of 4 education modules. These modules were mainly taught by "Rabers" over a period of four weeks (one session per week). SPSS version 21 was used for data entry and analysis. Data was analyzed through descriptive and inferential statistics (McNemar tests, paired t-test, and Chi-square test).
   Results
   Out of 280 students, a total of 270 students completed a pre and post-intervention survey. Of the 270 students, 124 (45.9%) were males and 146 (54.1%) were females. The mean age +/- SD of the participants was 16.59 +/- 0.784 years, ranging from 15-18 years. The study reveals a statistically significant improvement in the mean score of knowledge of students following the implementation of a health education program from 15.959 +/- 3.25 to 20.633 +/- 3.26 (p < 0.001). Moreover, no one of the students remained with poor knowledge, and relatively more than half (50.2%) of the students have upgraded to good knowledge level.
   Conclusion
   Implementing a health education program about substance use on high school students in Erbil city had improved the knowledge of students about this topic.

TI Spatial distribution of breast cancer mortality: Socioeconomic
   disparities and access to treatment in the state of Parana, Brazil
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID STAGE; CARE
AB Introduction
   Breast cancer remains an important public health problem that is responsible for high morbidity and mortality rates, especially in developing countries.
   Objective
   To analyze the socioeconomic and access disparities related to breast cancer mortality in 399 cities in the state of Parana, Brazil.
   Methods
   Ecological, descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study based on secondary data from the Mortality Information System from 2009 to 2012 in the state of Parana. Breast cancer mortality rate was calculated considering the mortality cases and women population of each municipality, both based on women older than 20 years old. Moran global and local analyses were used to verify the presence of spatial autocorrelation and spatial regression modeling (Spatial Lag-SAR) with the purpose of analyzing the association between socioeconomic indicators, access and mortality rates for breast cancer.
   Results
   Significant positive spatial autocorrelation was found for breast cancer mortality rates (I = 0.5432, p = 0.001). In the spatial regression analysis, the model explained 61% of the variance of the mortality rates for breast cancer. The mortality rate for breast cancer was negatively associated with the illiteracy rate (Coefficient = -0.0279) and positively associated with the access index (Coefficient = 12.9525).
   Conclusion
   The lower illiteracy rate has not been sufficient to reduce the specific mortality rate by breast cancer, and the higher the score of accessibility to cancer services, the higher the specific mortality due to breast cancer. The results show that in the state of Parana, the problem is not related to a lack of education of the patients or the distance walked, but rather with the organization of services. These conclusions have important political implications on the organization and quality of the services provided for the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer in the state of Parana.

AB BackgroundUniversal ocular screening of infants is not a standard procedure in children's health care system in China. This pilot study investigated prevalence of ocular abnormalities of 6weeks-age infants using wide-field digital imaging system.MethodsInfants aged 6weeks around were consecutively enrolled in a public hospital between April 2015 and August 2016. All the infants who were enrolled in the study underwent vision assessment, eye position examination, external eye check, pupillary light reflex, red reflex examination, anterior and posterior ocular segments were examined using flashlight, ophthalmoscope, and wide-field digital imaging system.ResultsA total of 481 infants at 45.16.1days after birth were enrolled in the study. 198 infants had abnormal findings (41.2%). Retinal white spots and retinal white areas were the most common findings (42.9% of abnormalities and 17.7% of all infants screened). The second major finding was retinal hemorrhage (16.2% of abnormalities and 6.7% of all infants screened). Other abnormal findings include retinal pigmentation, concomitant exotropia, neonatal dacryocystitis, retinopathy of prematurity, albinism-like fundus', congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, immature retina, corneal dermoid tumor, large physiologic cupping of optic disc, congenital persistent pupillary membrane, entropion trichiasis, subconjunctival hemorrhage, congenital cataract, vitreous hemorrhage, ptosis and choroidal nevus. Intervention of any form was required in 22 infants, which accounted for 11.1% of abnormalities detected and 4.6% of all infants screened.Conclusion Universal ocular screening is not only necessary for preterm infants but also for full-term infants. Addition of red reflex examination with wide-field digital imaging system can enhance the sensitivity of screening for ocular fundus abnormities. Further study with a long-term follow-up is needed in the future.

AB BackgroundEvery year, nearly one million deaths occur due to suboptimal breastfeeding. If universally practiced, exclusive breastfeeding alone prevents 11.6% of all under 5 deaths. Among strategies to improve exclusive breastfeeding rates, counselling by peers or health workers, has proven to be highly successful. With growing availability of cell phones in India, they are fast becoming a medium to spread information for promoting healthcare among pregnant women and their families. This study was conducted to assess effectiveness of cell phones for personalized lactation consultation to improve breastfeeding practices.MethodsThis was a two arm, pilot study in four urban maternity hospitals, retrained in Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative. The enrolled mother-infant pairs resided in slums and received healthcare services at the study sites. The control received routine healthcare services, whereas, the intervention received weekly cell phone counselling and daily text messages, in addition to counselling the routine healthcare services.Results1036 pregnant women were enrolled (518 - intervention and 518 - control). Rates of timely initiation of breastfeeding were significantly higher in intervention as compared to control (37% v/s 24%, p<0.001). Pre-lacteal feeding rates were similar and low in both groups (intervention: 19%, control: 18%, p=0.68). Rate of exclusive breastfeeding was similar between groups at 24h after delivery, but significantly higher in the intervention at all subsequent visits (control vs. intervention: 24h: 74% vs 74%, p=1.0; 6 wk.: 81% vs 97%, 10 wk.: 78% vs 98%, 14 wk.: 71% vs 96%, 6 mo: 49% vs 97%, p<0.001 for the last 4 visits). Adjusting for covariates, women in intervention were more likely to exclusively breastfeed than those in the control (AOR [95% CI]: 6.3 [4.9-8.0]).ConclusionUsing cell phones to provide pre and postnatal breastfeeding counselling to women can substantially augment optimal practices. High rates of exclusive breastfeeding at 6months were achieved by sustained contact and support using cell phones. This intervention shows immense potential for scale up by incorporation in both, public and private health systems.Trial registrationThis study was retrospectively registered with Clinical Trial Registry of India (http://www.ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials/pmaindet2.php?trialid=3060) Trial Number: CTRI/2011/06/001822 on date 20/06/2011.

AB BackgroundColorectal cancer (CRC) screening is widely recommended. Earlier research showed that the general public are positive about CRC screening, as too the eligible CRC screening population. Among the eligible CRC screening population this positive perception has been shown to be associated with their perceptions of cancer, preventive health screening and their own health. It is unclear whether these concepts are also associated with the positive perception of the general public. Knowing this can provide insight into the context in which public perception concerning CRC screening is established. The aim of our study was to examine which main perceptions are associated with the public perception concerning CRC screening.MethodsAn online survey was carried out in a Dutch population sample (adults 18+) among 1679 respondents (response rate was 56%). We assessed the public's perceptions concerning cancer, preventive health screening, own health, and the government, and examined their possible association with public opinion concerning CRC screening.ResultsThe public's positive attitude towards CRC screening is associated with the public's positive attitude towards preventive health screening in general, their perceived seriousness of cancer, their belief of health being important, and their trust in the government regarding national screening programmes.ConclusionTrust in the government and perceptions regarding the seriousness of cancer, preventive health screening and the importance of one's health seem to be important factors influencing how the public view CRC screening. The public are likely to process information about CRC screening in such a way that it confirms their existing beliefs of cancer being serious and preventive screening being positive. This makes it likely that they will notice information about the possible benefits of CRC screening more than information about its possible downsides, which would also contribute to the positive perception of CRC screening.

ID INTERVENTIONS
AB BackgroundRapid demographic and economic changes have made chronic disease the number one health issue in China, contributing to more than 80% of the country's 10.3 million annual deaths and nearly 70% of its total disease burden (Wang et al., Toward a Healthy and Harmonious Life in China: Stemming the Rising Tide of Non-Communicable Diseases, 2011; Yip and Hsiao, Lancet 384: 805-18, 2014). Diabetes is a major contributor to the chronic disease burden and is experienced by nearly 11% of the adult population of China (Yang et al., N Engl J Med 362:1090-101, 2010).In response to the challenges of chronic disease, the Chinese government initiated comprehensive health care reforms nationwide in 2009. A key measure was a hierarchical diagnosis and treatment system for monitoring and reducing chronic diseases and improving the community health service system (Barber et al., Health Policy Plan 29:367-78, 2014). Primary hospitals, such as community health service centers, are the main gatekeepers for management of diabetes and other chronic diseasesin China. In recognition of the need for a more patient-centered approach, the Chinese government has piloted a program incorporating methods of diabetes self-management for chronic care: the Happy Life Club (Browning et al., Front in Public Health 2:181, 2015). This program is modeled on a similar program developed in Australia (Kelly et al., Aust J Prim Health 9:186-9, 2003). The ICDMS is an important tool in the implementation of patient-centered programs targeting chronic health issues, and its success is determined by factors, such as frequent contact between patients and doctors and effective website training for patients.This retrospective study used de-identified data from the Fangzhuang (Beijing) intelligent chronic disease management system (ICDMS) database to evaluate the effect of an intelligent chronic disease management system on selected Beijing community patients who have type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).MethodsA comparative study before and after ICDMS implementation was performed to evaluate the effect of ICDMS on the rates of follow-up and laboratory examinations, measurement rates of blood glucose and lipids, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and blood lipid levels, as well as the corresponding health parameters. Continuous variables and categorical variables were analyzed using paired t-test and McNemar's tests, respectively.ResultsA total of 2451 T2DM patients met inclusion/exclusion criteria. Compared with the pre-index period, the laboratory examination, rates of blood glucose and blood lipids increased significantly in the post-index period (p<0.001). Triglyceride (TC) levels decreased significantly from 5.22mmol/L to 5.11mmol/L (p<0.05), and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels increased significantly from 1.35mmol/L to 1.48mmol/L (p<0.05). The control rate of TC increased from 24.86 to 29.76% (p=0.079). The control rate of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) increased from 12.16 to 13.97% (p=0.421), while the control rate of HDL-C increased significantly from 68.60 to 78.77%. Importantly, Compared with the patients with HbA1C above 7% in the pre-index period, the mean HbA1c decreased significantly from 7.84 to 6.94%((p<0.001) in the post-index period, and the control rate of HbA1c was 57.43%.ConclusionsThe intelligent chronic disease management system is an effective tool in the management of T2DM and should be promoted by the Community Health Service Center in China as well as in other developing countries.

AB BackgroundIncarcerated people carry a high burden of infection, including blood-borne diseases (BBDs). It is also known that one million people contract a sexually transmitted infection (STI) every day worldwide, which represents a global public health challenge. However, data regarding the prevalence of STIs and the risk factors among incarcerated populations are lacking. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and associated factors of BBDs and STIs among detainees in the largest pre-trial prison in Switzerland.MethodsIn a cross-sectional study conducted at the Champ-Dollon pre-trial prison, 273 male detainees answered a standardized questionnaire and were screened for syphilis, herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), HIV, and hepatitis C (HCV). Prevalence rates and associations of BBDs and STIs with risk factors were computed.ResultsMost participants (90.9%) were migrants from outside Western Europe, and 5.9% were injecting drug users. HCV was diagnosed among 6.2% of participants (antibody prevalence). The prevalence of HCV was higher among injecting drug users (81.2%) than non-injectors (1.6%). The prevalence of HIV, syphilis, and HSV-2 was 0.4%, 1.1%, and 22.4%, respectively. HCV was associated with a history of injecting drug use and HSV-2 with a lower education level and being older than 26years.ConclusionsThis study showed the infection prevalence of 2-9 times higher among detainees than in the Swiss community. It also illustrated that these infections are associated with sociodemographic and risk factors. Therefore, the prison environment offers an opportunity to strengthen infectious disease control programs targeting specific subgroups of at-risk people. Such programs would benefit both the prison population and broader society.

TI Beyond financial conflicts of interest: Institutional oversight of
   faculty consulting agreements at schools of medicine and public health
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CLINICAL-TRIAL AGREEMENTS; NATIONAL-SURVEY; LIFE-SCIENCE; INDUSTRY;
   PARTICIPATION
AB Importance
   Approximately one-third of U.S. life sciences faculty engage in industry consulting. Despite reports that consulting contracts often impinge on faculty and university interests, institutional approaches to regulating consulting agreements are largely unknown.
   Objective
   To investigate the nature of institutional oversight of faculty consulting contracts at U.S. schools of medicine and public health.
   Design
   Structured telephone interviews with institutional administrators. Questions included the nature of oversight for faculty consulting agreements, if any, and views about consulting as a private versus institutional matter. Interviews were analyzed using a structured coding scheme.
   Setting
   All accredited schools of medicine and public health in the U.S.
   Participants
   Administrators responsible for faculty affairs were identified via internet searches and telephone and email follow-up. The 118 administrators interviewed represented 73% of U.S. schools of medicine and public health, and 75% of those invited to participate.
   Intervention
   Structured, 15-30 minute telephone interviews.
   Main outcomes and measures
   Prevalence and type of institutional oversight; responses to concerning provisions in consulting agreements; perceptions of institutional oversight.
   Results
   One third of institutions (36%) required faculty to submit at least some agreements for institutional review and 36% reviewed contracts upon request, while 35% refused to review contracts. Among institutions with review, there was wide variation the issues covered. The most common topic was intellectual property rights (64%), while only 23% looked at publication rights and 19% for inappropriately broad confidentiality provisions. Six in ten administrators reported they had no power to prevent faculty from signing consulting agreements. Although most respondents identified institutional risks from consulting relationships, many maintained that consulting agreements are "private."
   Conclusions and relevance
   Oversight of faculty consulting agreements at U.S. schools of medicine and public health is inconsistent across institutions and usually not robust. The interests at stake suggest the need for stronger oversight.

AB BackgroundThere has been little evaluation of the postpartum quality of life (QOL) of women in India and its association with the mode of birth. This study piloted the use of the generic EQ-5D-5L questionnaire to assess postpartum QOL experienced by rural Indian women.MethodsA convenience sample of rural women who gave birth in a health facility in Gujarat or Madhya Pradesh was recruited into this pilot study. QOL was measured during three interviews within 30days of birth using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. Patient-level quality-adjusted life days (QALDs) were estimated. Multivariate regression was used to adjust for selected baseline characteristics.ResultsForty-six women with cesarean section and 178 with vaginal birth from 17 public and private health facilities were studied. Postpartum QOL in both groups improved between interviews 1 and 3. Comparing between vaginal and cesarean births indicated that the vaginal birth group had a higher QOL (0-3 days postpartum: 0.28 vs. 0.57, 3-7 days postpartum: 0.59 vs. 0.81; P<0.001) and was more likely to report no or slight problems in 4 of 5 health dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, painordiscomfort; P0.04) during interviews 1 and 2. Postpartum QOL converged, but still differed between groups by the time of interview 3 (21-30 days postpartum: 0.85 vs. 0.93; P<0.001). While most women reported no problems by the end of the first postpartum month, the difference in the ability to perform usual activities persisted (P=0.001). In result, fewer QALDs were attained by women in the cesarean section group between day 1 and day 21 postpartum (13.1 vs. 16.6 QALDs; P<0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that having had an episiotomy during vaginal birth was also associated with reduced QOL postpartum, but to a lesser extent than cesarean section. Similar results were obtained when adjusting for socioeconomic, pregnancy and birth characteristics, but postpartum QOL already ceased to be statistically different between groups before interview 3.ConclusionsVaginal births, even with episiotomy, were associated with a higher postpartum QOL than cesarean births among the Indian women in our pilot study. Finding these expected results suggests that the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire is asuitable instrumentto assess postpartum QOL in Indian women.

AB BackgroundDespite their potential health and social benefits, adoption and use of improved cookstoves has been low throughout much of the world. Explanations for low adoption rates of these technologies include prices that are not affordable for the target populations, limited opportunities for households to learn about cookstoves through peers, and perceptions that these technologies are not appropriate for local cooking needs. The P3 project employs a novel experimental design to explore each of these factors and their interactive effects on cookstove demand, adoption, use and exposure outcomes.MethodsThe P3 study is being conducted in the Kassena-Nankana Districts of Northern Ghana. Leveraging an earlier improved cookstove study that was conducted in this area, the central design of the P3 biomass stove experiment involves offering stoves at randomly varying prices to peers and non-peers of households that had previously received stoves for free. Using household surveys, electronic stove use monitors, and low-cost, portable monitoring equipment, we measure how prices and peers' experience affect perceptions of stove quality, the decision to purchase a stove, use of improved and traditional stoves over time, and personal exposure to air pollutants from the stoves.DiscussionThe challenges that public health and development communities have faced in spreading adoption of potentially welfare-enhancing technologies, like improved cookstoves, have highlighted the need for interdisciplinary, multisectoral approaches. The design of the P3 project draws on economic theory, public health practice, engineering, and environmental sciences, to more fully grasp the drivers and barriers to expanding access to and uptake of cleaner stoves. Our partnership between academic institutions, in the US and Ghana, and a local environmental non-governmental organization creates unique opportunities to disseminate and scale up lessons learned.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT03617952 7/31/18 (Retrospectively Registered).

AB Leptospirosis is a worldwide veterinary and public health concern, and well recognized infectious disease of horses. Seroprevalence rates vary with geography, but many studies have confirmed a high exposure rate. The correlation between seropositivity and shedding status has not been made in horses, however. The aims of this study were to use seminested PCR on urine from apparently healthy horses to determine period prevalence of leptospiral shedding and to correlate these findings with MAT results to establish associations with client based survey data regarding horse management and environment. Serum and free-catch urine were collected from 204 healthy horses between May 2016-December 2017. Serum was used to determine GGT, creatinine concentrations, and six serovar MAT. Urine samples were submitted for PCR testing of leptospiral 23S rRNA. Client consent and survey data were collected for all subjects. Potential risk factors included drinking water source, exposure to livestock and dogs, geographical location, season, and precipitation. Two horses were positive on urine PCR for leptospirosis (shedding prevalence 1%), yet only one had a high reciprocal MAT titer of >= 800. Both horses were negative on urine PCR one month later without treatment. Approximately 77% of horses (157/204) were seroreactive (MAT reciprocal titer >= 100) with titers to serogroup Australis detected more frequently than others (47.5%; (97/204)). Apparently healthy horses infrequently shed Leptospira spp. in urine, yet seroreactivity in clinically normal horses is high (77%), confirming high exposure rates to Leptospira spp. in the Central Midwest.

AB Background: Despite a decline in the number of new HIV infections in the UK overall, the number and proportion of new HIV diagnoses in people aged >= 50 years continues to increase. People aged >= 50 years are disproportionately affected by late diagnosis, which is associated with poorer health outcomes, increased treatment complexity and increased healthcare costs. Late HIV diagnosis also has significant public health implications in terms of onward HIV transmission. It is not fully understood what factors affect the decision of an older person to test for HIV. The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with testing for HIV in people aged >= 50 years who tested late for HIV.
   Methods: We interviewed 20 people aged >= 50 years diagnosed late with HIV to identify factors associated with HIV testing. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed.
   Results: Seven themes associated with HIV testing in people aged >= 50 years were identified: experience of early HIV/AIDS campaigns, HIV knowledge, presence of symptoms and symptom attribution, risk and risk perception, generational approaches to health and sexual health, stigma, and type of testing and testing venue.
   Conclusion: Some factors associated with testing identified in this study were unique to older individuals. People aged >= 50 years often do not perceive themselves to be at risk of HIV. Further, stigma and a lack of knowledge of how to access HIV testing suggest a need for health promotion and suggest current sexual health services may need to adapt to better meet their needs.

TI Poor treatment outcomes and its determinants among tuberculosis patients
   in selected health facilities in East Wollega, Western Ethiopia
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   Although it is a preventable and treatable disease, tuberculosis remains a major medical and public health problem throughout the world. The control and elimination of tuberculosis is currently challenged by the development and spread of antituberculosis drug resistance. The resistance is often correlated to the absence of properly implemented control measures that lead to poor treatment outcomes. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to assess poor treatment outcomes and its determinants among tuberculosis patients in selected health facilities in East Wollega zone, Western Ethiopia.
   Method
   A five-year retrospective cross-sectional study design was employed. Data were collected from patients' medical record from January to March 2017. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Descriptive statistics were used to generate and summarize frequencies. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to associate the potential determinants of poor treatment outcomes.
   Results
   From 995 patients with documented treatment outcomes, 58.9% were males with a mean age of 31.9 +/- 16.3 years and 58% lived in rural areas. Majorities of cases (95.7%) were newly treated ones. Nearly half of the cases had extrapulmonary tuberculosis and 6.8% were coinfected with HIV. Nearly three-quarter of patients had completed their treatment while 17.2%, 2.9%, 4.8%, 0.4% patients were cured, defaulted, died, and failed, respectively. The overall treatment success rate was 91.9%. Being treated in Anger Gute health center (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.27; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.18-4.38); male (AOR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.06-3.10); lived in rural areas (AOR: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.02-2.91); previously treated (AOR: 2.72; 95% CI: 1.16-6.39) and unknown HIV status (AOR: 4.56; 95% CI: 1.98-10.50) were determinants of poor treatment outcomes.
   Conclusion
   The current treatment success rate was exceeded the recommended target. However, special attention and strict follow up is required for tuberculosis patients with high risk of unsuccessful treatment outcomes including male, rural resident, previously treated and unknown in HIV status patients throughout their treatment periods.

TI Exploring factors influencing the work-related morale for certified
   nursing assistants in hospice care: A structural equation modeling study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID LONG-TERM-CARE; SOCIAL SUPPORT; JOB-SATISFACTION; PALLIATIVE CARE;
   STRESS; NURSES; ALTRUISM; BURNOUT; IMPACT; SCALE
AB Background
   Certified nursing assistants (CNAs) in palliative care units often encounter the death of patients and undergo emotional burdens because of their altruistic practices. However, the influences of altruism and perceptions of death on the work morale of CNAs remain unclear. The fact that morale can be improved by modifying related factors justifies the necessity of a theoretical model of morale for CNAs. However, such a model is currently absent. Based on relevant literature, factors including altruism, social support, perceptions of death, and job satisfaction are related to morale through the mediation of job stress.
   Aim
   This study was aimed toward determining the influencing factors and developing a structural model of morale with regard to CNAs working in palliative care units.
   Design
   The hypothesized model was tested in a cross-sectional design with structural equation modeling using AMOS 23.
   Setting/Participants
   A total of 413 CNAs from five hospice units in Taiwan participated in the survey.
   Results
   Goodness-of-fit indexes, including chi(2)/DF = 2.187, PGFI = 0.461, and PNFI = 0.462, among others, confirmed the modified model fit the data well. Altruism, social support, perceptions of death, and job satisfaction were negatively related to job stress (-0.238, -0.196, -0.204, and -0.131, respectively). Altruism and social support positively affected job satisfaction (0.635 and 0.553). Factors directly affecting morale included altruism, social support, job stress, and job satisfaction (0.837, 0.711, -0.244, and 0.540, respectively). The relationship between altruism and morale was the strongest among all the direct paths toward morale. Job stress was the major mediator in these relationships.
   Conclusion
   Altruism is imperative for morale. The confirmed model is called the Five Constructs to Morale (5CM) model. These findings indicate the need to assess the levels of altruism and perceptions of death during the recruitment of CNAs. From the perspective of human resource management and organizational behavior, CNAs with a high level of altruism and a positive attitude toward death assure the well-being of end of life patients because of work involvement and commitment to the challenging work of hospice care. The cultivation of a supportive environment and coping strategies are suggested for the management of CNAs facing patient death. Hospice care decision makers should carefully assess morale levels among health professionals by applying the 5CM model. Identifying modifiable factors that can improve morale among nursing staff in hospice care to ensure work fulfillment and quality care merits emphasis in clinical practice. The establishment of effective strategies to facilitate the work morale of nursing staff is suggested for palliative care units. Morale improvement related task should be a global public health priority.

ID HYPERENDEMIC AREAS; MANSONI
AB Background: Brazil is an endemic country for schistosomiasis in the Latin American and Caribbean countries. Pernambuco is a higher-endemic Brazilian state among the 19 states reporting the disease in the country; schistosomiasis affects 102 (55%) of its 185 municipalities. Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment cycles of the SANAR Program (Plan to Reduce and Eliminate Neglected Diseases) in Pernambuco State in Northeast Brazil.
   Methods: A cross-sectional population-based study was conducted in 2014 via a household survey in 117 hyperendemic locations in the state of Pernambuco. We compared the schistosomiasis prevalence rates in hyperendemic locations, aggregated by geographical region, before and after the intervention. The dependent variable was a positive stool test result by the Kato-Katz method, and the main exposure variable was the number of treatment cycles (one/two). The covariables were the regions of the state and socioenvironmental, socioeconomic, demographic and behavioral characteristics.
   Results: In all, 12,969 individuals were interviewed, 8932 of whom had stool tests. Of these, 4969 (55.6%) underwent two cycles of collective treatment. Changes in the environmental conditions since 2011 were minimal. Comparison before (2011) and after (2014) treatment showed an average schistosomiasis prevalence of 18.6%, decreasing to 4.1% and 2.0% in locations with one and two treatment cycles, respectively. In 2014, the highest schistosomiasis prevalence was found in the forest area (2.8%), while the lowest was found in the northern region (1.2%) of the state. The adjusted analysis showed a lower occurrence of schistosomiasis in individuals living in areas with two treatment cycles than in individuals from areas with just one cycle (PR 0.65, 95% CI: 0.47-0.89).
   Conclusions: The political decision made in Pernambuco to implement the SANAR Program in 2011 greatly impacted the burden of schistosomiasis. This program was effective in reducing the occurrence of schistosomiasis in hyperendemic areas in Pernambuco, with a stronger response in areas with two cycles of collective treatment.

TI Synthesising conceptual frameworks for patient and public involvement in
   research - a critical appraisal of a meta-narrative review
SO BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
LA English
DT Review
DE Conceptual framework; Critical appraisal; Patient and public
   involvement; Meta-narrative review; Synthesis
ID HEALTH; ENGAGEMENT
AB Background: A number of conceptual frameworks for patient and public involvement (PPI) in research have been published in recent years. Although some are based on empirical research and/or existing theory, in many cases the basis of the conceptual frameworks is not evident. In 2015 a systematic review was published by a collaborative review group reporting a meta-narrative approach to synthesise a conceptual framework for PPI in research (hereafter 'the synthesis'). As the first such synthesis it is important to critically scrutinise this meta-narrative review. The 'RAMESES publication standards for meta-narrative reviews' provide a framework for critically appraising published meta-narrative reviews such as this synthesis, although we recognise that these were published concurrently. Thus the primary objective of this research was to appraise this synthesis of conceptual frameworks for PPI in research in order to inform future conceptualisation.
   Methods: Four researchers critically appraised the synthesis using the RAMESES publication standards as a framework for assessment. Data were extracted independently using a data extraction form closely based on the RAMESES publication standards. Each item from the standards was assessed on a four point scale (0 = unmet, 1 = minimally met, 2 = partly met, 3 = fully met). The four critical appraisals were then compared and any differences resolved through discussion.
   Results: A good degree of inter-rater reliability was found. A consensus assessment of the synthesis as a meta-narrative review of PPI conceptual frameworks was achieved with an average of '1' (minimally met) across all 20 items. Two key items ('evidence of adherence to guiding principles of meta-narrative review' and 'analysis and synthesis processes') were both wholly unmet. Therefore the paper did not meet our minimum requirements for a meta-narrative review. We found the RAMESES publication standards were a useful tool for carrying out a critical appraisal although some minor improvements are suggested.
   Conclusions: Although the aims of the authors' synthesis were commendable, and the conceptual framework presented was coherent and attractive, the paper did not demonstrate a transparent and replicable meta-narrative review approach. There is a continuing need for a more rigorous synthesis of conceptual frameworks for PPI.

   demography on rabies vaccination coverage in Africa
SO PLOS ONE

ID MACHAKOS DISTRICT; PUBLIC-HEALTH; CANINE RABIES; ECOLOGY; POPULATION;
   MANAGEMENT; CAMPAIGN; BAMAKO; WORLD
AB Background
   Dogs are important reservoirs of rabies, a zoonotic viral encephalitis that kills thousands of people in Asia and Africa annually. Mass dog vaccination is recommended for the prevention of rabies in both humans and dogs. Mass vaccinations should be conducted annually but more frequent campaigns may be required in areas with high dog turnover rates. Consequently, a good understanding of dog demography is essential for the control of the disease. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dog demography on rabies vaccination coverage following a mass vaccination campaign with at least 70% vaccination coverage.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   A dog population model was constructed to explore the effect of dog demography on rabies vaccination coverage decline. Important model parameters were identified through a comprehensive literature search on dog demography in Africa. A system dynamics approach was adopted to build a dog population model to simulate the effects of demographic processes on rabies vaccination coverage. Vensim PLE Plus software was used to construct the model. Multivariate sensitivity simulations using data from 22 studies and 12 African countries were performed to investigate the effect of dog turnover rates on vaccination coverage decline. In addition, an adjusted vaccination coverage to estimate the proportion of vaccinated dogs with adequate immunity at 12 months post-vaccination was calculated. The results demonstrated that the vaccination coverage and adjusted vaccination coverage remained over 30% and 20% respectively at 12 months if annual mass vaccinations achieved at least 70% coverage.
   Conclusions/Significance
   The results demonstrated that annual mass vaccination campaigns with at least 70% vaccination coverage would maintain a herd immunity of 20-45% between campaigns.

TI Value of inventory information in allocating a limited supply of
   influenza vaccine during a pandemic
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID A H1N1; COVERAGE; RISK
AB Objective
   To understand the value of information on vaccine inventory levels during an influenza pandemic, we propose a simulation study to compare vaccine allocation strategies using: (i) only population information (pro-rata, or population-based, PB), (ii) both population and vaccine inventory information (population and inventory-based, PIB).
   Methods
   We adapt an agent-based simulation model to predict the spread of the disease both geographically and temporally. We study PB and PIB when uptake rates vary geographically. The simulation study is done from 2015 to 2017, using population and commuting data from the state of Georgia from the United States census.
   Findings
   Compared to PB under reasonable scenarios, PIB reduces the infection attack rate from 23.4% to 22.4%, decreases the amount of leftover inventory from 827 to 152 thousand, and maintains or increases the percentage of vaccinated population.
   Conclusions
   Our results indicate the need for greater vaccine inventory visibility in public health supply chains, especially when supply is limited, and uptake rates vary geographically. Such visibility has a potential to decrease the number of infections, help identify locations with low uptake rates and to motivate public awareness efforts.

AB Background
   High quality primary care is fundamental to achieving health for all. Research priority setting is a key facilitator of improving how research activity responds to concrete needs. There has never before been an attempt to identify international primary care research priorities, in order to guide resource allocation and to enhance global primary care. This study aimed to identify a list of top 10 primary care research priorities, as identified by members of the public, health professionals working in primary care, researchers, and policymakers.
   Methods
   We adapted the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership process, to conduct multiple rounds of stakeholder recruitment and prioritization. The study included an online survey conducted in three languages, followed by an in-person priority setting exercise involving primary care stakeholders from 13 countries.
   Findings
   Participants identified a list of top 10 international primary care research priorities. These were focused on diverse topics such as enhancing use of information and communication technology, and improving integration of indigenous communities' knowledge in the design of primary care services. The main limitations of the study related to challenges in engaging an adequate diversity and number of appropriate stakeholders, particularly members of the public, in aggregating the diverse set of responses into coherent categories representative of the participants' perspectives and in adequately representing the diversity of submitted responses while ensuring research priorities on the final list are sufficiently actionable to guide resource allocation.
   Conclusions
   The top 10 identified research priorities have the potential to guide research resource allocation, supporting funding agencies and initiatives to promote global primary care research and practice.

AB Understanding the burden and pattern of mental disorders as well as mapping the existing resources for delivery of mental health services in India, has been a felt need over decades. Recognizing this necessity, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, commissioned the National Mental Health Survey (NMHS) in the year 2014-15. The NMHS aimed to estimate the prevalence and burden of mental health disorders in India and identify current treatment gaps, existing patterns of health-care seeking, service utilization patterns, along with an understanding of the impact and disability due to these disorders. This paper describes the design, steps and the methodology adopted for phase 1 of the NMHS conducted in India. The NMHS phase 1 covered a representative population of 39,532 from 12 states across 6 regions of India, namely, the states of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh (North); Tamil Nadu and Kerala (South); Jharkhand and West Bengal (East); Rajasthan and Gujarat (West); Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh (Central) and Assam and Manipur (North East). The NMHS of India (2015-16) is a unique representative survey which adopted a uniform and standardized methodology which sought to overcome limitations of previous surveys. It employed a multi-stage, stratified, random cluster sampling technique, with random selection of clusters based on Probability Proportionate to Size. It was expected that the findings from the NMHS 2015-16 would reveal the burden of mental disorders, the magnitude of the treatment gap, existing challenges and prevailing barriers in the mental-health delivery systems in the country at a single point in time. It is hoped that the results of NMHS will provide the evidence to strengthen and implement mental health policies and programs in the near future and provide the rationale to enhance investment in mental health care in India. It is also hoped that the NMHS will provide a framework for conducting similar population based surveys on mental health and other public health problems in low and middle-income countries.

AB Stress is proven to have detrimental effects on physical and mental health. Due to different tasks and study designs, the direct consequences of acute stress have been found to be wide-reaching: while some studies report prosocial effects, others report increases in antisocial behavior, still others report no effect. To control for specific effects of different stressors and to consider the role of social anxiety in stress-related social behavior, we investigated the effects of social versus physical stress on behavior in male participants possessing different levels of social anxiety. In a randomized, controlled two by two design we investigated the impact of social and physical stress on behavior in healthy young men. We found significant influences on various subjective increases in stress by physical and social stress, but no interaction effect. Cortisol was significantly increased by physical stress, and the heart rate was modulated by physical and social stress as well as their combination. Social anxiety modulated the subjective stress response but not the cortisol or heart rate response. With respect to behavior, our results show that social and physical stress interacted to modulate trust, trustworthiness, and sharing. While social stress and physical stress alone reduced prosocial behavior, a combination of the two stressor modalities could restore prosociality. Social stress alone reduced nonsocial risk behavior regardless of physical stress. Social anxiety was associated with higher subjective stress responses and higher levels of trust. As a consequence, future studies will need to investigate further various stressors and clarify their effects on social behavior in health and social anxiety disorders.

TI Student and staff perceptions of alcohol as part of student life in
   Denmark: A Q methodology study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID BINGE DRINKING; CONSUMPTION
AB Introduction
   Intervening effectively to prevent students' harmful use of alcohol remains a challenge. Harmful alcohol use has been noted as the most dominant public health problem facing universities today. This study sought to investigate the diversity in staff and student perceptions of the contribution alcohol makes to student life in a Danish university setting. Increasing understanding of staff and students' perceptions of how alcohol fits into student life is required to amend future public health intervention for this population.
   Materials and methods
   This Q methodology study included 38 staff members and 105 students from Aarhus University, Denmark. Participants used online Q sorting software, to rank 40 statements about the contribution alcohol makes to the university student experience from strongly agree to disagree. To support the interpretation of the factors, self-reported alcohol consumption and demographic data were collected. In addition qualitative data was collected on the participant's reasons for the ranking of the items they most strongly agreed or disagreed with.
   Results and discussion
   Using principal components analysis, five statistically independent viewpoints for students and four for staff were identified.
   The findings provide evidence to inform approaches to prevent harmful alcohol use. Some viewpoints suggest a need for tailored secondary and tertiary prevention and intervention that focusses on individuals and/or sub-groups who are at risk of consuming alcohol at harmful levels. Other viewpoints suggest the need for primary universal prevention to support the maintenance of healthy norms which can prevent harmful alcohol behaviour. Public health campaigns need to ensure that interventions targeting harmful alcohol use at universities challenge problematic perceptions and attitudes while also bolstering exposure to positive norms.

AB We previously developed a mathematical simulation of serogroup A Neisseria meningitidis (NmA) transmission in Burkina Faso, with the goal of forecasting the relative benefit of different vaccination programs. Here, we revisit key structural assumptions of the model by comparing how accurately the different assumptions reproduce observed NmA trends following vaccine introduction. A priori, we updated several of the model's parameters based on recently published studies. We simulated NmA disease under different assumptions about duration of vaccine-induced protection (including the possibility that vaccine-induced protection may last longer than natural immunity). We compared simulated and observed case counts from 2011-2017. We then used the best-fit model to forecast the impact of different vaccination strategies. Our updated model, with the assumption that vaccine-induced immunity lasts longer than immunity following NmA colonization, was able to reproduce observed trends in NmA disease. The updated model predicts that, following a mass campaign among persons 1-29 years of age, either routine immunization of 9 month-old children or periodic mini-campaigns among children 1-4 years of age will lead to sustained control of epidemic NmA in Burkina Faso. This validated model can help public health officials set policies for meningococcal vaccination in Africa.

AB Background
   Infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus is a serious public health problem that threatens the lives of many people including health care workers. Health care workers are frequently exposed to occupational hazards throughout their careers. Health care workers are at risk of being infected by the virus when caring for patients in health care facilities. Utilization of HIV Post-exposure Prophylaxis (HIV PEP) is very vital once an individual is exposed.

   The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of occupational exposure, knowledge of, availability and utilization of post exposure prophylaxis among health care workers in Singida District Council, Tanzania.
   Methods
   A descriptive cross sectional study was conducted from April to May 2013. Health care workers actively treating patients were enrolled from 18 heath facilities in Singida District Council. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire, and analysed using Stata version 12.
   Results
   Out of 239 participants, slightly more than half, 124 (52%) had inadequate overall knowledge of HIV PEP. Of the 239, 121(50.6%) participants experienced occupational exposure. Two leading types of exposure were blood splash 57(47.1%) and needle stick injuries 45 (37.2%),respectively. Among the 121 exposed participants, 83(68.6%) reported the exposure incident, 91(75.2%) had an HIV test, 32 (26.4%), started HIV PEP after testing, 28 Occupational injuries and utilization of post exposure prophylaxis by healthcare workers in Tanzania (23.1%), completed HIV PEP, and 65 (53.7%) had a follow-up HIV test. About two thirds (159/239), of participants reported that HIV PEP services were available at the time the study was conducted, and 49 (20.5%), reported daily access to HIV PEP service.
   Conclusion
   The prevalence of occupational exposure among health care workers is high with low utilization of HIV PEP. The majority of healthcare workers had inadequate knowledge of HIV PEP. The findings highlight the need to improve the level of knowledge of HIV PEP and utilization of PEP among this at-high-risk-group in Singida.

ID PUBLIC-HEALTH; HERD-IMMUNITY; UNITED-STATES; DECISIONS; PARENTS;
   MEASLES; IMMUNIZATION; PATIENT; TRUST; CARE
AB Background: Vaccine hesitancy is a growing threat to public health. The reasons are complex but linked inextricably to a lack of trust in vaccines, expertise and traditional sources of authority. Efforts to increase immunization uptake in children in many countries that have seen a fall in vaccination rates are two-fold: addressing hesitancy by improving healthcare professional-parent exchange and information provision in the clinic; and, secondly, public health strategies that can override parental concerns and values with coercive measures such as mandatory and presumptive vaccination.
   Main text: It is argued that such conflicting, parallel approaches seriously risk undermining trust that is crucial for sustaining herd immunity. Although public health strategies can be ethically justified in limiting freedoms, a parent-centered approach seldom acknowledges how it is impacted by contemporaneous coercive measures. In addition, the clinical encounter is not well suited to helping parents consider the public dimensions of vaccination, despite these being important for trust formation and informed decision-making. Efforts to address vaccine hesitancy require more consistent engagement of parental and citizen views. Along with evidence-based information, debates need to be informed by ethical support that equips parents and professionals to respond to the private and public dimensions of vaccination in a more even-handed, transparent manner.
   Conclusion: Efforts to address vaccine hesitancy need to avoid simple reliance on either parental values or coercive public policies. To do this effectively requires increasing citizen engagement on vaccination to help inform a parent-centered approach and legitimize public policy measures. In addition, cultivating a more ethically consistent strategy means moving beyond the current silos of health ethics - clinical and public health ethics.

AB Background: Injection drug use (IDU) is a growing public health threat in Virginia, though there is limited knowledge of related morbidity. The purpose of this study was to describe the temporal, geographic and clinical trends and characteristics of infective endocarditis associated with IDU (IDU-IE) and to identify opportunities for better-quality care of people who inject drugs (PWID).
   Methods: We reviewed charts for all admissions coded for both IE and drug use disorders at the University of Virginia Medical Center (UVA) from January 2000 to July 2016. A random sample of 30 admissions coded for IE per year were reviewed to evaluate temporal trends in the proportion of IDU associated IE cases.
   Results: There were a total of 76 patients with IDU-IE during the study period, 7.54-fold increase (prevalence ratio: 8.54, 95% CI 3.70-19.72) from 2000 to 2016. The proportion of IE that was IDU-associated increased by nearly 10% each year (prevalence ratio of IDU per year: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.05-1.14). Patients with IDU-IE had longer hospital stays [median days (interquartile range); IDU-IE, 17 (10-29); non-IDU-IE, 10 (6-18); p-value = 0.001] with almost twice the cost of admission as those without IDU [median (interquartile range); IDU-IE, $47,899 ($24,578-78,144); non-IDU-IE, $26,460 ($10,220-60,059); p-value = 0.001]. In 52% of cases there was no documentation of any discussion regarding addiction treatment.
   Conclusion: IDU-IE is a severe infection that leads to significant morbidity and healthcare related costs. IDU-IE rates are increasing and will likely continue to do so without targeted interventions to help PWID. The diagnosis and treatment of IDU-IE provides an opportunity for the delivery of addiction treatment, counseling, and harm reduction strategies.

TI Role of economic evidence in coverage decision-making in South Korea
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID DRUG REIMBURSEMENT DECISIONS; 4 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES; COST-EFFECTIVENESS;
   AUSTRALIA; HEALTH; CANADA; NICE; RECOMMENDATIONS
AB Objectives
   The South Korean government required the submission of economic evidence when it implemented the Positive-List System in December 2006. This study investigates the key factors that influenced actual public insurance reimbursement decisions, including the role of economic evidence, after 10 years of decision practice under compulsory health technology assessment (HTA) for new drugs.
   Method
   Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the impact of the variables involved, including cost-effectiveness ratio as a key variable, on reimbursement decisions. The latter were defined as "yes" or "no" at a submitted price and indication. Only cases (n = 91) that present a cost-effectiveness ratio, and that have been reviewed based on this ratio from January 2007 to December 2016, were included in the analysis.
   Results
   Cases with higher cost-effectiveness ratios were less likely to be accepted. In addition, drugs that were used to treat severe diseases and drugs with no substitute were more likely to be recommended. The probability of acceptance declined along with the level of uncertainty in the submitted evidence. The acceptance rate for severe-disease drugs has increased since 2013, when the government introduced several policies that lowered the existing barriers to positive reimbursement. However, such an increase was not statistically significant.
   Conclusions
   Cost-effectiveness is one of the most influential factors in drug-reimbursement decisions. However, inclusion of other explanatory variables, in addition to the cost-effectiveness ratio, predicted the results of decisions more accurately.

TI Social isolation and multiple chronic diseases after age 50: A European
   macro-regional analysis

LA English
DT Article
ID ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY; RISK-FACTORS; NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES;
   SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; PHYSICAL HEALTH; OLDER MEN; LONELINESS;
   DETERMINANTS; MULTIMORBIDITY; COUNTRIES
AB Background
   Different studies have found that socioeconomic determinants influence the prevalence of chronic diseases in older people. However, there has been relatively little research on the incidence of how social isolation may affect them. We suggest that social isolation is a serious concern for people living with chronic illnesses.
   Method
   In this paper, we examine whether there is an increase in the propensity of being diagnosed with chronic illnesses because of a decrease in social relations for elderly Europeans. We have used a panel data for Waves 1-6 (2004-2015) of Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and logistic regressions. Besides, we have studied three geographic macro-areas (Nordic, Continental and Southern). Being diagnosed with three or more chronic diseases is considered as a dependent variable, and as social control variables we have used three isolation proxies (living alone, providing help to family, friends or neighbours and participation-club activities). Other socio-demographic variables are included (gender, age, educational level, job situation, area of location and quality of life).
   Results
   Our results for the full sample indicate that people who participate in social activities have fewer probability of suffering from chronic diseases (OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.54, 0.92). For people who live alone the reverse effect is observed (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.04, 1.39). Differences are shown by macro-areas, e.g. providing help (OR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.34, 0.97) isolation proxy is significant for the Nordic macro-area. Club-participation activities and living alone are significant for Continental and Southern macro-areas, respectively (OR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.55, 0.82; OR = 1.46, 95% CI 1.21, 1.77).
   Conclusions
   Social isolation increases the risk of being diagnosed with chronic illnesses. That is, people with greater social participation have lower risk of suffering from multiple chronic diseases. This risk linked to isolation, together with the traditional one associated with lifestyles, should be considered in the development of new public policies.

ID GLOBAL SURVEY; SOCIAL MEDIA; COMMUNITY; INTERNET; SEEKING; POPULATION;
   INFECTIONS; PREVALENCE; TWITTER; ADVICE
AB Background
   Antimicrobial resistance is a global public health problem with some socially patterned drivers. The objective of the study was to investigate associations between use of and trust in the Internet as a source of health-related information and the public's knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours regarding antibiotics.
   Methods
   Two representative cross-sectional surveys (the 2015 Wellcome Monitor (n = 1524) and UK segment (n = 1330) of the 2016 Eurobarometer 85.1) covering knowledge about antibiotics and antibiotic consumption were analysed. Knowledge, attitude, and behaviour variables were analysed using regression in relation to demographic characteristics and use and trust in the Internet as a source of information.
   Results
   The key findings of the analysis are that both use of the Internet as a source of medical research information (variable from the Wellcome Monitor) and trust in the Internet as a source of information about antibiotics (variable from the Eurobarometer) were independently and positively associated with knowledge, attitude, and behaviour regarding antibiotics. Additionally, knowledge about antibiotics was positively associated with behaviour with antibiotics (Wellcome Monitor) and attitude towards finishing antibiotic prescriptions (Eurobarometer). Higher levels of education were associated with better knowledge about antibiotics in both datasets. Older age was positively associated with behaviour and attitude regarding antibiotic consumption.
   Conclusions
   The Internet is a resource for disseminating quality health information that has the potential to improve stewardship of antibiotics in the community. This study suggests that members of the UK public that use the Internet as a source of health-related information are more likely to be better informed about, and be more responsible with, antibiotics. This mode of information dissemination should be capitalised on to improve antimicrobial stewardship, and further research should examine what the most effective online information sources are in the UK and to what extent their association with behaviour is causal.

   LUDWIK HIRSZFELD; GENDER ANALYSIS; BENCHMARKING; BIOCHEMISTRY; MEDICINE;
   INDEX
AB Background
   The city of Wroclaw in Poland represents one of Central Europeans oldest capitals of science with numerous Nobel laureates. Due to a long history of political suppressions with Nazi Germany and Communism from 1933 until 1989, its scientific community was suppressed for more than half a century.
   Methods
   The present study assessed scientific activities in the field of social and neighbouring sciences using density equalizing mapping. On the basis of the NewQIS (New Quality and Quantity Indices in Science) platform and the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) of the Web of Science database, a total of 1787 articles originating from Wroclaw were identified between 1966 and 2017.
   Results
   In total, 549 research collaborations of Wroclaw with 96 different countries were present (30.7%). Among the 107 research areas the highest activity was found for the field of Business and Economics with n = 272 articles (average citation rate (AVR) of 12.54), followed by Psychology (n = 252 articles, AVR = 9.06), Psychiatry (n = 205 articles, AVR = 4.74) and Public, Environmental and Occupational Health (n = 145 articles, AVR = 7.96). The highest AVR was found for Operations Research (25.36 with n = 87 articles). Density equalizing mapping procedures revealed a global pattern of social sciences research collaborations with scientists from Germany, the UK and the US as the primary cooperating partner of Wroclaw. The different countries had major differences in the area of research collaborations.
   Conclusions
   This is the first study that depicts the global network of Wroclaw scientific activities in the field of social sciences. The exorbitant increase in research activity from 2006 onwards can lead to the assumption that Wroclaw social sciences encounter a fruitful future.

TI Barriers to accessing cervical cancer screening among HIV positive women
   in Kgatleng district, Botswana: A qualitative study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH; ATTITUDES
AB Background
   Low and middle-income countries have a greater share of the cervical cancer burden, but lower screening coverage, compared to high-income countries. Moreover, screening uptake and disease outcomes are generally worse in rural areas as well as in the HIV positive population. Efforts directed at increasing the screening rates are important in order to decrease cancer-related morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to explore the barriers to women with HIV accessing cervical cancer screening in Kgatleng district, Botswana.
   Methods
   A phenomenological qualitative study utilising semi-structured interviews with fourteen HIV positive women, selected by purposive sampling. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and the 5-steps of the framework method, assisted by Atlas-ti software, was used for qualitative data analysis.
   Results
   Contextual factors included distance, public transport issues and work commitments. Health system factors highlighted unavailability of results, inconsistent appointment systems, long queues and equipment shortages and poor patient-centred communication skills, particularly skills in explanation and planning. Patient factors identified were lack of knowledge of cervical cancer, benefits of screening, effectiveness of treatment, as well as personal fears and misconceptions.
   Conclusion
   Cervical cancer screening was poorly accessed due to a weak primary care system, insufficient health promotion and information as well as poor communication skills. These issues could be partly addressed by considering alternative technology and one-stop models of testing and treating.

AB BackgroundChanges in the national drug policy always have impact on the drug utilization. In the context of China health care reform, what changes had happened in the trend of drug utilization in public hospitals? Has this change met the expectations of policy design? This study was conducted to explore the trend of medicine consumption in county public hospitals before and after health care reform, and to provide real-world evidence to help assess the effectiveness of national drug policy.MethodsA cross-sectional study was performed to investigate the drug utilization trends of 6 county public hospitals in Anhui Province, which is the first pilot area of China health care reform. Data were collected before and after the implementation of the China National Essential Medicine Policy (NEMP) to analyse the drug utilization indicators, such as the drug utilization constituent ratio, the rate of essential medicine usage and the rate of antibiotic consumption.ResultsChemicals are used most frequently and account for 60%70%, followed by oral agents of proprietary Chinese medicine. The results also show increased consumption of Chinese medicine injections ((2)=28.428, P<0.01). The top 3 chemical medicines consumed were anti-infective drugs (12.92%), cardiovascular system drugs (11.61%), and digestive system drugs (8.42%). For Chinese traditional medicine, the top 3 drugs consumed were internal medicine drugs (66.03%), surgical drugs (8.45%), and gynaecological drugs (7.70%). The total sales amounts of drugs covered by medical insurance are at a high level (all above 80%), whereas essential medicines are less than 50% at almost all county-level medical institutions.ConclusionsThis study uncovered the changing tendency of medicine usage under the implementation of the reform. Chinese medicine injections and anti-infective drugs have always been a sustained concern of pharmacovigilance. It is noteworthy that although essential medicines are advocated for as a priority for use in the government-run hospital, the consumption proportion of these medicines is lower than expected.

AB BackgroundChronic kidney disease (CKD) is becoming a major public health problem around the world. But the prevalence has not been reported in South Asian region as a whole. This study aimed to systematically review the existing data from population based studies in this region to bridge this gap.MethodsArticles published and reported prevalence of CKD according to K/DOQI practice guideline in eight South Asian countries between December 1955 and April 2017 were searched, screened and evaluated from seven electronic databases using the PRISMA checklist. CKD was defined as creatinine clearance (CrCl) or GFR less than 60ml/min/1.73m(2).ResultsSixteen population-based studies were found from four South Asian countries (India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal) that used eGFR to measure CKD. No study was available from Sri Lanka, Maldives, Bhutan and Afghanistan. Number of participants ranged from 301 in Pakistan to 12,271 in India. Majority of the studies focused solely on urban population. Different studies used different equations for measuring eGFR. The prevalence of CKD ranged from 10.6% in Nepal to 23.3% in Pakistan using MDRD equation. This prevalence was higher among older age group people. Equal number of studies reported high prevalence among male and female each.ConclusionsThis systematic review reported high prevalence of CKD in South Asian countries. The findings of this study will help pertinent stakeholders to prepare suitable policy and effective public health intervention in order to reduce the burden of this deadly disease in the most densely populated share of the globe.

TI What utility scores do mental health service users, healthcare
   professionals and members of the general public attribute to different
   health states? A co-produced mixed methods online survey
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID TIME TRADE-OFF; STANDARD GAMBLE; VALUATION; VALIDITY; PATIENT;
   COPRODUCTION; PREFERENCES; DEPRESSION; DISABILITY
AB Background
   Utility scores are integral to health economics decision-making. Typically, utility scores have not been scored or developed with mental health service users. The aims of this study were to i) collaborate with service users to develop descriptions of five mental health states (psychosis, depression, eating disorder, medication side effects and self-harm); ii) explore feasibility and acceptability of using scenario-based health states in an e-survey; iii) evaluate which utility measures (standard gamble (SG), time trade off (TTO) and rating scale (RS)) are preferred; and iv) determine how different participant groups discriminate between the health scenarios and rank them.
   Design and methods
   This was a co-produced mixed methods cross-sectional online survey. Utility scores were generated using the SG, TTO and RS methods; difficulty of the completing each method, markers of acceptability and participants' preference were also assessed.
   Results
   A total of 119 participants (58%) fully completed the survey. For any given health state, SG consistently generated higher utility scores compared to RS and for some health states higher also than TTO (i.e. SG produces inflated utility scores relative to RS and TTO). Results suggest that different utility measures produce different evaluations of described health states. The TTO was preferred by all participant groups over the SG. The three participant groups scored four (of five) health scenarios comparably. Psychosis scored as the worst health state to live with while medication side-effects were viewed more positively than other scenarios (depression, eating disorders, self-harm) by all participant groups. However, there was a difference in how the depression scenario was scored, with service users giving depression a lower utility score compared to other groups.
   Conclusion
   Mental health state scenarios used to generate utility scores can be co-produced and are well received by a broad range of participants. Utility valuations using SG, TTO and RS were feasible for use with service users, carers, healthcare professionals and members of the general public. Future studies of utility scores in psychiatry should aim to include mental health service users as both co-investigators and respondents.

AB Background: Molecular surveillance and outbreak investigation are important for elimination of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the United States. A web-based system, Global Hepatitis Outbreak and Surveillance Technology (GHOST), has been developed using Illumina MiSeq-based amplicon sequence data derived from the HCV E1/E2-junction genomic region to enable public health institutions to conduct cost-effective and accurate molecular surveillance, outbreak detection and strain characterization. However, as there are many factors that could impact input data quality to which the GHOST system is not completely immune, accuracy of epidemiological inferences generated by GHOST may be affected. Here, we analyze the data submitted to the GHOST system during its pilot phase to assess the nature of the data and to identify common quality concerns that can be detected and corrected automatically.
   Results: The GHOST quality control filters were individually examined, and quality failure rates were measured for all samples, including negative controls. New filters were developed and introduced to detect primer dimers, loss of specimen-specific product, or short products. The genotyping tool was adjusted to improve the accuracy of subtype calls. The identification of "chordless" cycles in a transmission network from data generated with known laboratory-based quality concerns allowed for further improvement of transmission detection by GHOST in surveillance settings. Parameters derived to detect actionable common quality control anomalies were incorporated into the automatic quality control module that rejects data depending on the magnitude of a quality problem, and warns and guides users in performing correctional actions. The guiding responses generated by the system are tailored to the GHOST laboratory protocol.
   Conclusions: Several new quality control problems were identified in MiSeq data submitted to GHOST and used to improve protection of the system from erroneous data and users from erroneous inferences. The GHOST system was upgraded to include identification of causes of erroneous data and recommendation of corrective actions to laboratory users.

AB BackgroundSuicide is a serious public health problem in low- and middle-income countries. Understanding the context- and gender-specific risk factors for non-fatal suicidal behaviour is the cornerstone of evidence-based public health interventions to reduce suicide. Poverty and symptoms of depression are well established risk factors for suicidal behaviour. However, little is understood about how proximal economic factors (such as losing one's job, or food insecurity) may confound the effects of symptoms of depression to increase the risk of non-fatal suicidal behaviour in vulnerable populations, such as young men living under conditions of endemic poverty. The aim of this study was to explore the extent to which a wide range of poverty-related variables account for non-fatal suicidal behaviour independent of, or in addition to, symptoms of depression among young men living in low-resource communities in South Africa(SA).MethodsData were collected from a clustered sample of 647 young men living in low-resource communities in the Western Cape province of SA. Multivariate regressions were used to identify the associations between poverty-related measures, symptoms of depression, and past-month prevalence of non-fatal suicidal behaviour.ResultsNon-fatal suicidal behaviour in the last month was reported by 47 (6.13%) participants: suicidal ideation (n=43; 5.97%); suicide plan (n=5; 0.77%); suicide attempt (n=4; 0.62%), and deliberate self-harm without intent to die (n=4; 0.62%). Past-month prevalence of non-fatal suicidal behaviour was significantly associated with particular dimensions of poverty (living in a home without a toilet on the premises, having previously been fired, and food insecurity), but not with other dimensions of poverty (such as prolonged unemployment and low levels of income). However, symptoms of depression were a more significant predictor of non-fatal suicidal behaviour than any measure of poverty (aOR=1.093, 95% CI=1.058-1.129, p<.000).ConclusionsDepressive symptoms are more strongly associated with non-fatal suicidal behaviour than a range of proximal and distal economic factors among young men living under conditions of endemic poverty in South Africa. This has important public health implications and highlights the importance of increasing young men's access to psychiatric services and targeting depression as an integral component of suicide prevention in low resource communities.

AB Background
   The obesity epidemic is spreading rapidly in Guatemala, a low/middle income country still struggling with undernutrition. Sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) consumption is strongly associated with overweight, obesity, and non-communicable diseases. In Guatemala, SSBs are readily available and consumption is high, particularly among adolescents. SSB taxes have been proposed as a cost-effective way to reduce consumption and generate revenues for public health, as has been demonstrated in several countries around the world.
   Objective
   To estimate the price, expenditure, quality, and cross-price elasticity of beverage demand using household survey data.
   Method
   We conducted a secondary analysis on the 2014 Guatemala Living Conditions National Survey that includes national representative household data on expenditure. Own price, expenditure, quality, and cross-price elasticities of milk, soft drinks, packaged juices, and bottled water were estimated using Deaton's Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS), controlling for goods' quality. Household characteristics and beverage expenditure are summarized for urban and rural locations using descriptive statistics.
   Results
   Positive expenditure on soft drinks was highest (50.9% of households). Positive expenditure on bottled water was next for urban households (43.8%) and lowest for rural households (10.8%). Own-price elasticities for all beverages are negative and statistically significant. Own-price elasticity of soft drinks is -1.39, suggesting that with a 10% increase in price, consumption would decrease by 13.9%. Expenditure elasticity for soft drinks (0.99) suggests that a 10% household expenditure increase would result in a 9.9% increase in demand. Milk (0.07) and soft drinks (0.07) have positive quality elasticity implying that, as household total expenditure increases, the quality of these beverages, measured by their unit values, also increases.
   Conclusion
   Soft drink demand is highly sensitive to changes in prices, suggesting that SSB taxes could significantly reduce consumption, which, in turn, could contribute to curbing the overweight/obesity epidemic.

AB Background
   CLinical pharmacy services (CPS) are professional services provided by pharmacists, who use their skills and knowledge to take an active role in patient health. These services have expanded in health systems around the world. However, it is important to have a comprehensive understanding of factors that may hinder the implementation of CPS in health systems.
   Objective
   To identify pharmacists' and managers' perceptions of barriers regarding the implementation of CPS in some public health units in a metropolis in Northeast Brazil.
   Methods
   This is a qualitative study based on focus groups and semi-structured, face-to-face, in-depth interviews. Participants were health-system pharmacists and managers, selected based on their direct participation in the implementation process. Focus groups were carried out with the pharmacists, and interviews were carried out with managers. The audio and videos were transcribed verbatim in full, and were independently analyzed using content analysis. This study was approved by the Brazilian Committee of Ethics in Research and all participants signed informed consent forms.
   Findings
   There were two focus groups and five interviews. The discussions generated 240 minutes of recordings. The health-system pharmacists and managers expressed barriers were allocated into five categories to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the implementation of CPS; these barriers were related to: the local healthcare networks, the healthcare team, the pharmacists, the implementation process, and the patients.
   Conclusions
   This study revealed the perceptions of barriers associated with the participants involved in the implementation of CPS in some public health units in a metropolis in Northeast Brazil. The barriers reflect the challenges to be overcome in the CPS implementation process in the health systems.

AB BackgroundTraditional, hierarchical government structures have recently been challenged by increased complexity, fragmented services and heavy public demand. When healthcare services become fragmented and decentralised, they require redesign. Inter-municipal cooperation is a strategy to deal with current challenges and future demographic changes. Few studies exist that can help us conceptualize challenges regarding employment in this context and inform managers in the involved municipalities. This study aims to identify critical issues for employees in inter-municipal health care services and to elaborate on how and why these issues are experienced.MethodsA multiple qualitative case study was conducted with data from interviews, observation studies, a participant workshop and inter-municipal healthcare service project documents and reports. The study involved two districts in Norway and six cases including 17 informants. First, a within-case analysis was conducted for all cases; second, a cross-case analysis was conducted in each district to examine replication, contrasts and extension to emergent findings; and, eventually, replicated findings in Districts 1 and 2 were analysed across districts.ResultsThree critical issues were identified: support, differences, and geographical distances. Employees working in teams experienced fewer challenges than did those working as isolated individuals.ConclusionsCritical issues for employees represent an important aspect of inter-municipal cooperation, and additional research should be undertaken to inform future policy and practice.

AB BackgroundCommunity sport can potentially help to increase levels of physical activity and improve public health. Sport coaches have a role to play in designing and implementing community sport for health. To equip the community sport workforce with the knowledge and skills to design and deliver sport and empower inactive participants to take part, this study delivered a bespoke training package on public health and recruiting inactive people to community sport for sport coaches. We examined the views of sport coach participants about the training and their role in designing and delivering a complex community sport intervention for increasing physical activity and improving health.MethodsSemi-structured interviews were conducted with paid full-time sport coaches (n=15) and community sport managers and commissioners (n=15) with expertise in sport coaching. Interviews were conducted by a skilled interviewer with in-depth understanding of community sport and sport coach training, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis.ResultsThree key themes were identified showing how the role of sport coaches can be maximised in designing and delivering community sport for physical activity and health outcomes, and in empowering participants to take part. The themes were: (1) training sport coaches in understanding public health, (2) public involvement in community sport for health, and (3) building collaborations between community sport and public health sectors.ConclusionTraining for sport coaches is required to develop understandings of public health and skills in targeting, recruiting and retaining inactive people to community sport. Public involvement in designing community sport is significant in empowering inactive people to take part. Ongoing knowledge exchange activities between the community sport and public health sector are also required in ensuring community sport can increase physical activity and improve public health.

AB BackgroundMediterranean diet (MD) interventions are demonstrated to significantly reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk but are typically resource intensive and delivered by health professionals. There is considerable interest to develop interventions that target sustained dietary behaviour change and that are feasible to scale-up for wider public health benefit. The aim of this paper is to describe the process used to develop a peer support intervention to encourage dietary behaviour change towards a MD in non-Mediterranean adults at high CVD risk.MethodsThe Medical Research Council (MRC) and Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) frameworks and the COM-B (Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, Behaviour) theoretical model were used to guide the intervention development process. We used a combination of evidence synthesis and qualitative research with the target population, health professionals, and community health personnel to develop the intervention over three main stages: (1) we identified the evidence base and selected dietary behaviours that needed to change, (2) we developed a theoretical basis for how the intervention might encourage behaviour change towards a MD and selected intervention functions that could drive the desired MD behaviour change, and (3) we defined the intervention content and modelled outcomes.ResultsA theory-based, culturally tailored, peer support intervention was developed to specifically target behaviour change towards a MD in the target population. The intervention was a group-based program delivered by trained peer volunteers over 12-months, and incorporated strategies to enhance social support, self-efficacy, problem-solving, knowledge, and attitudes to address identified barriers to adopting a MD from the COM-B analysis.ConclusionsThe MRC and BCW frameworks provided a systematic and complementary process for development of a theory-based peer support intervention to encourage dietary behaviour change towards a MD in non-Mediterranean adults at high CVD risk. The next step is to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and diet behaviour change outcomes in response to the peer support intervention (change towards a MD and nutrient biomarkers) using a randomized controlled trial design.

AB Background: The Epi-Info software suite, built and maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is widely used by epidemiologists and public health researchers to collect and analyze public health data, especially in the event of outbreaks such as Ebola and Zika. As it exists today, Epi-Info Desktop runs only on the Windows platform, and the larger Epi-Info Suite of products consists of separate codebases for several different devices and use-cases. Software portability has become increasingly important over the past few years as it offers a number of obvious benefits. These include reduced development time, reduced cost, and simplified system architecture. Thus, there is a blatant need for continued research. Specifically, it is critical to fully understand any underlying negative performance issues which arise from platform-agnostic systems. Such understanding should allow for improved design, and thus result in substantial mitigation of reduced performance. In this paper, we present a viable cross-platform architecture for Epi-Info which solves many of these problems.
   Results: We have successfully generated executables for Linux, Mac, and Windows from a single code-base, and we have shown that performance need not be completely sacrificed when building a cross-platform application. This has been accomplished by using Electron as a wrapper for an AngularJS app, a Python analytics module, and a local, browser-based NoSQL database.
   Conclusions: Promising results warrant future research. Specifically, the design allows for cross-platform form-design, data-collection, offline/online modes, scalable storage, automatic local-to-remote data sync, and fast analytics which rival more traditional approaches.

AB BackgroundThe use of herbal medicines in developing countries has been increasing over the years. In Ghana, since 2011, the government hasbeen piloting the integration of herbal medicine in 17 public hospitals. However, the strengths and the weaknesses of the integration have not been fully explored. The current study sought to examine the strengths and weaknessesof the integration usingthe WHO health systems framework.MethodsThis study used qualitative, exploratory study design involving interviews of 25 key informants. The respondents had experience in conducting herbal medicine research. Two key informants were medical herbalists practising in hospitals piloting the integration in Ghana.We used Framework analysis to identify the perspectives of key informants in regards to the integration. ResultsKey informants mostly support the integration although some noted that the government needs to support scale-up in other public hospitals. Among the strengths cited were the employment of medical herbalists, utilization of traditional knowledge, research opportunities, and efficient service delivery by restricting the prescription and use of fake herbal medicine. The weaknesses were the lack of government policies on implementing the integration, financial challenges because the National HealthInsurance Scheme does not cover herbal medicine, poor advocacy and research opportunities, and lack of training of conventional health practitioners in herbal medicine.ConclusionsResearchers view the integration of the two healthcare systems-biomedicine, and herbal medicine- positively but it has challenges that need to be addressed. The integration could offer more opportunities for researching into herbal medicine. More training for conventional health professionals in herbal medicine could increase the chances of better coordination between the two units. Additionally, strong advocacy and publicity is needed to educate more people on the integration and the utilization of the services.

AB BackgroundRabies is a significant public health problem in China. Previous spatial epidemiological studies have helped understand the epidemiology of animal and human rabies in China. However, quantification of effects derived from relevant factors was insufficient and complex spatial interactions were not well articulated, which may lead to non-negligible bias. In this study, we aimed to quantify the role of socio-economic and climate factors in the spatial distribution of human rabies to support decision making pertaining to rabies control in China.MethodsWe conducted a multivariate analysis of human rabies in China with explicit consideration for spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence effects. The panel of 20,368 cases reported between 2005 and 2013 and their socio-economic and climate factors was implemented in regression models. Several significant covariates were extracted, including the longitude, the average temperature, the distance to county center, the distance to the road network and the distance to the nearest rabies case. The GMM was adopted to provide unbiased estimation with respect to heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation.ResultsThe analysis explained the inferred relationships between the counts of cases aggregated to 271 spatially-defined cells and the explanatory variables. The results suggested that temperature, longitude, the distance to county centers and the distance to the road network are positively associated with the local incidence of human rabies while the distance to newly occurred rabies cases has a negative correlation. With heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation taken into consideration, the estimation of regression models performed better.ConclusionsIt was found that climatic and socioeconomic factors have significant influence on the spread of human rabies in China as they continuously affect the living environments of humans and animals, which critically impacts on how timely local citizens can gain access to post-exposure prophylactic services. Moreover, through comparisons between traditional regression models and the aggregation model that allows for heterogeneity and spatial effects, we demonstrated the validity and advantage of the aggregation model. It outperformed the existing models and decreased the estimation bias brought by omission of the spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence effects. Statistical results are readily translated into public health policy takeaways.

AB BackgroundVitamin D deficiency is a global public health issue. More than half of pregnant women are affected by vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency. Studies suggest an association between low vitamin D concentrations during pregnancy with intrauterine growth restriction and prematurity. This study aimed to describe the concentrations of 25(OH)D (25-hydroxyvitamin D) of mothers who delivered preterm newborns compared to women with full-term pregnancy deliveries, as well as to relate 25(OH)D blood concentrations of mothers with those of their newborns.MethodThis cross-sectional study was conducted with 66 mothers who had given birth to preterm babies and their preterm newborns (PTNB, <32weeks), and 92 women who had given birth at the full-term of their pregnancy and their newborns (FTNB). Data were collected on the characteristics of mothers (gestational age, diseases, and habits) and newborns (anthropometry and adequacy for gestational age). Ten milliliters of blood were drawn from the mothers and the umbilical cord of newborns at birth to identify the 25(OH)D, parathyroid hormone, calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase concentrations.ResultsMothers in the PTNB group had significantly lower mean 25(OH)D blood levels (21.710.8ng/mL vs. 26.2 +/- 9.8ng/mL; p=0.011) and were three times more likely to have insufficiency when compared to mothers in the FTNB group (OR=2.993; 95%CI 1.02-8.74). Newborns in the PTNB group also had lower 25(OH)D concentrations compared to FTNB group (25.9 +/- 13.9ng/dL vs. 31.9 +/- 12.3ng/dL; p=0.009). There was a directly proportional correlation between mother and newborn umbilical cord 25(OH)D concentrations in PTNB (r=0.596; p<0.001) and FTNB (r=0.765; p<0.001).Conclusion p id=Par4 Mothers who delivered preterm babies and their preterm newborns had lower 25(OH)D concentrations compared to women who had given birth at the full-term of their pregnancy. In both groups, 25(OH)D concentrations of the mothers correlated directly with those of the newborns, and this correlation was higher in the full-term birth group. Nevertheless, the recommended universal vitamin D supplementation in pregnant women to curb the risk of preterm birth is still incipient. More studies are required to clarify the particularities of vitamin D metabolism further and define the adequate 25(OH)D concentrations throughout pregnancy.

AB Background: Swedish National Quality Registries (NQRs) are observational clinical registries that have long been seen as an underused resource for research and quality improvement (QI) in health care. In recent years, NQRs have also been recognised as an area where patients can be involved, contributing with self-reported experiences and estimations of health effects. This study aimed to investigate what the registry management perceived as barriers and facilitators for the use of NQRs in QI, research, and interaction with patients, and main activities undertaken to enhance their use for these purposes. The aim was further to identify potential differences between various types of NQRs for their use in these areas.
   Methods: In this multiple case study, nine NQRs were purposively selected. Interviews (n = 18) were conducted and analysed iteratively using conventional and directed content analysis.
   Results: A recent national investment initiative enabled more intensive work with development areas previously identified by the NQR management teams. The recent focus on value-based health care and other contemporary national healthcare investments aiming at QI and public benchmarking were perceived as facilitating factors. Having to perform double registrations due to shortcomings in digital systems was perceived as a barrier, as was the lack of authority on behalf of the registry management to request participation in NQRs and QI activities based on registry outcomes. The registry management teams used three strategies to enhance the use of NQRs: ensuring registering of correct and complete data, ensuring updated and understandable information available for patients, clinicians, researchers and others stakeholders, and intensifying cooperation with them. Varied characteristics of the NQRs influenced their use, and the possibility to reach various end-users was connected to the focus area and context of the NQRs.
   Conclusions: The recent national investment initiative contributed to already ongoing work to strengthen the use of NQRs. To further increase the use, the demands of stakeholders and end-users must be in focus, but also an understanding of the NQRs' various characteristics and challenges. The end-users may have in common a need for training in the methodology of registry based research and benchmarking, and how to be more patient-centred.

ID HEALTH-CARE SETTINGS; EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is now recognized as a major threat to public health, and surveillance of AMR is essential for successful containment. In 2000, Japan Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (JANIS) Clinical Laboratory (CL) division has been launched as a voluntary AMR surveillance funded by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and managed by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases. In this study, we aimed to propose a model of sustainable national AMR surveillance which provides not only national AMR surveillance reports but also benchmarking reports to each hospital to facilitate infection control practices.
   Methods: JANIS CL division collects comprehensive specimen-based data complies with JANIS data format from participating hospitals each month. It had targeted only blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples but was expanded to all types of specimens in 2007 at revision of JANIS. The JANIS system interprets the antimicrobial susceptibility according to the same criteria and conducts removal of duplicates to allow accurate comparison between hospitals. Monthly feedback reports are created automatically within 48 h, while quarterly and annual reports are generated after data validation.
   Results: At the beginning, 468 hospitals were enrolled in the JANIS CL division, but the number of hospitals that submitted data decreased to 210 (45%) in 2006. After surveillance revision in 2007, annual recruitment of hospitals was initiated and as of 2015, 1475 hospitals participated, and 1461 (99%) of them submitted data throughout the year. Nationwide surveillance data collected over the past decade revealed that the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has decreased since 2008, and that its prevalence is higher in the western part of Japan, where the number of hospitals per capita is higher than in the eastern part.
   Conclusions: JANIS CL division serves a model of sustainable national AMR surveillance system. Comprehensive data for all specimens promotes understanding of the sampling frequency and prevalence of AMR. As a well-established system for providing rich information to guide action both locally and nationally, JANIS may also be utilized for sharing AMR data globally.

AB BackgroundTo achieve optimal health outcomes, people with chronic kidney disease must make changes in their everyday lives to self-manage their condition. This can be challenging, and there is a need for self-management support interventions which assist people to become successful self-managers. While interventions have been developed, the literature in this area is sparse and limited by lack of both individualisation and sound theoretical basis. The aim of this study was to implement and evaluate the Chronic Kidney Disease-Self-Management Support intervention: a theory-based, person-centred self-management intervention for people with chronic kidney disease stages 1-4.MethodsA single-sample, pre-post study of an individualised, 12-week intervention based upon principles of social-cognitive theory and person-centred care was conducted with patients attending outpatient renal clinics in Queensland, Australia (N=66). Data were collected at T0 (pre-intervention) and T1 (post-intervention). Primary outcomes were self-efficacy and self-management behaviour.ResultsThere were significant, small-to-medium improvements in primary outcomes (self-efficacy: mean difference+0.8, 95% CI 0.3-1.2, d=0.4; self-management behaviour: mean difference+6.2, 95% CI 4.5-7.9, d=0.8). There were further significant improvements in secondary outcomes (blood pressure, disease-specific knowledge, physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, alcohol consumption, health-related quality of life, psychological distress, and communication with healthcare providers), with effect sizes ranging from negligible to large (all ps<.05).ConclusionsSocial-cognitive theory shows promise as a framework for providing effective person-centred self-management support to patients within this population, and longer-term evaluation is needed.Trial registrationAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12618000066280.

AB BackgroundSickle cell disease (SCD) is the most prevalent monogenic hereditary pathology associated with the presence of hemoglobin SS in the world. It can affect individuals, leading to changes in the face and body, causing a deficiency in dental and bone tissue formation that can ultimately result in a higher level of predisposition to developing dental caries. This study aimed to evaluate the oral condition of children and adolescents with SCD in comparison with the condition of healthy controls.MethodsThis was a cross-sectional study of children and adolescents aged 5 to 18 of both sexes from a hematology center in Bahia, Brazil, and subjects without hemoglobinopathies from a public school of the same state (comparison group). There were 124 individuals, 63 in the comparison group and 61 in the disease group. Interviews, dental and periodontal exams using the DMFT and Periodontal Community Index, respectively, were performed, and the salivary buffer capacity and salivary flow rates of the entire sample population were evaluated. The categorical variables were compared using a chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. For comparison of means, the Student's-t test was used for independent samples that presented symmetrical distribution.ResultsThe study showed that the DMFT was 2.08 (2.71) for the SCD group and 1.05 (1.67) for the comparison group (p=0.013). For dmft, the values were 2.3 (2.6) and 0.88 (1.2), respectively, (p=0.018). Exams of the periodontium showed the presence of gingival bleeding and dental calculus, with no statistical significance between groups (p=0.984). When evaluating salivary flow and buffer capacity, no significant differences were observed for the flow rates (p=0.485), but the SCD group presented a lower buffer capacity compared with the comparison group (p=0.006). Individuals who used hydroxyurea had a dmft (2.50) higher than that of the comparison group (2.00), and salivary flow was lower than the normal rate in 70% of the children who did not use this medication.ConclusionChildren and teenagers with SCD had deficient oral health when compared with the comparison group, presenting a higher level of dental caries and lower buffer capacity.

AB Background: New Jersey Department of Education (NJDOE) requires by law for accidents/incidents (injury) involving career-technical-vocational education (CTE) students and staff to be reported within five business days to the NJ Safe Schools Program (NJSS) using an online surveillance system. NJ public schools and charter schools (CS) through school districts (SD) or county offices report school data annually to NJDOE, including per pupil spending (PPS). In this study, we examined potential associations of PPS with several variables on injury in NJ: injury cause, injury location on the body, injury type, injury severity, use of PPE, and location of treatment for injury.
   Methods: PPS data for December 1998-June 2015 from CTE SDs (one per NJ county, n = 21), four CS SD and eight county special services districts were analyzed. T-test examined potential differences in PPS regarding injury severity and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Stepwise logistic regression assessed potential associations between PPS and various injury surveillance variables.
   Results: There were more CTE injuries reported among SD with lower PPS than among SD with higher PPS. Relatively less severe injuries, e.g., bruise/bumps and cuts/lacerations, more often occurred at schools and SD with higher PPS. Conversely, relatively more severe injuries, e.g., fractures, more often occurred at schools and SD with lower PPS.
   Conclusion: Future research should further investigate disparities regarding younger worker injuries reported within school-based career-technical-vocational education programs by PPS and other factors like sex or gender, severity, safety training provided and work experience at time of injury.

   Mobility; Southern Africa; Botswana; Swaziland; Low-income countries
ID SERVICES; OUTCOMES; IMPACT
AB Background: Millions of people in Southern Africa are deprived of basic human rights such as the right to education and work because of the large and growing unmet demand for assistive technologies (AT). Evidence is needed to better characterize the lack of AT access.
   Methods: This study serves to identify the sociodemographic factors that are associated with access to AT in two countries in Southern Africa, Botswana and Swaziland. To achieve this aim, logistics regression was applied to a subset of variables from two Living Conditions Studies, nationally representative surveys that were conducted in Southern Africa (2014 and 2010).
   Results: In Botswana, 44% of people who needed AT did not receive it, while in Swaziland the unmet need was 67%. Among the sociodemographic variables tested, the type of disability was the most important factor in determining AT access in both countries. The likelihood of AT access was highest in both countries for those who had mobility limitations (i.e., difficulty walking/climbing stairs) [Botswana: 6.4 odds ratio (OR) = 6.4., 95% confidence internal (CI) (3.6-11.3); Swaziland: OR = 3.2, CI (1.4-7.3)], in comparison to those with non-mobility types of disabilities.
   Conclusions: These findings provide support for governments and other stakeholders in the AT sector to prioritize AT to address the large unmet demand, and expand the range of AT products provided so that people with hearing, seeing, self-care, communication and cognition difficulties have equal access to AT as those with mobility impairments. A step toward achieving these aims is to inventory AT product types that are commonly covered through the public sector in each country, and identify common gaps (e.g., daily living aids). Advancing the AT sector as a whole within Southern Africa will require large scale qualitative studies that achieve a comprehensive understanding of the bottlenecks in regional AT supply, procurement, and delivery systems.

AB Background: The introduction of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for foetal aneuploidies is currently changing the field of prenatal screening in many countries. As it is non-invasive, safe and accurate, this technique allows for a broad implementation of first-trimester prenatal screening, which raises ethical issues, related, for instance, to informed choice and adverse societal consequences. This article offers an account of a leading international ethical framework for prenatal screening, examines how this framework is used by professionals working in the field of NIPT, and presents ethical guidance for the expansion of the scope of prenatal screening in practice.
   Methods: A comparative analysis of authoritative documents is combined with 15 semi-structured interviews with professionals in the field of prenatal screening in the Netherlands. Data were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis.
   Results: The current ethical framework consists of four pillars: the aim of screening, the proportionality of the test, justice, and societal aspects. Respondents recognised and supported this framework in practice, but expressed some concerns. Professionals felt that pregnant women do not always make informed choices, while this is seen as central to reproductive autonomy (the aim of screening), and that pre-test counselling practices stand in need of improvement. Respondents believed that the benefits of NIPT, and of an expansion of its scope, outweigh the harms (proportionality), which are thought to be acceptable. They felt that the out-of-pocket financial contribution currently required by pregnant women constitutes a barrier to access to NIPT, which disproportionally affects those of a lower socioeconomic status (justice). Finally, professionals recognised but did not share concerns about a rising pressure to test or discrimination of disabled persons (societal aspects).
   Conclusions: Four types of limits to the scope of NIPT are proposed: NIPT should generate only test outcomes that are relevant to reproductive decision-making, informed choice should be (made) possible through adequate pre-test counselling, the rights of future children should be respected, and equal access should be guaranteed. Although the focus of the interview study is on the Dutch healthcare setting, insights and conclusions can be applied internationally and to other healthcare systems.

DT Article
DE Junior middle school students; health literacy; quality of life(QOL);
   cross-sectional study
ID EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT USE; ADOLESCENTS; CHILDREN; BEHAVIORS; IMPACT
AB Background: Lower health literacy is associated with poor quality of life (QOL) among patients with chronic disease; little is known about this relationship among the general population, especially for child and adolescent To fill this gap, this paper aimed to investigate the association between health literacy and QOL in junior middle school students, and explore how QOL varies by health literacy.
   Methods: An anonymous cross-sectional survey was conducted among junior middle school students (aged 12-15) from Shapingba district Chongqing in China, and participants were recruited using stratified cluster sampling. Health literacy and QOL were measured using two validated scales, and quantified using a five-point Likert scale with health literacy classified as low, medium, or high. We used multivariable logistic regression to test adjusted association between health literacy and QOL.
   Results: A total of 1774 junior middle school students were evaluated, with the mean age was 13.8 +/- 1.0 and of whom 905 (51.0%) were male. About 25.5% of the research subjects had a low health literacy. When controlling for age, grade, family structure and other covariates, highest discrimination was found among participants with low to high health literacy. Overall, Students who equipped with higher health literacy was associated with greater QOL (P < 0.01), and this discrimination remained significant in subscales: physiological well-being (P < 0.01), mental well-being (P < 0.01), social well-being (P < 0.01) and pubertal well-being (P < 0.01).
   Conclusions: The prevalence of low health literacy among junior middle school students in Chongqing area was relatively high, and inadequate health literacy may contribute to poorer QOL among junior middle school students. It merits further longitudinal studies to confirm the impact of health literacy on QOL. Overall, to improve students' QOL, public health efforts for further improving awareness and enhancing effective promotion and education are urgently needed in junior middle school students, especially for low health literacy populations.

TI The challenges of institutionalizing community-level social
   accountability mechanisms for health and nutrition: a qualitative study
   in Odisha, India
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Community-level accountability; Marginalized groups and individuals;
   Maternal and child health; Community service delivery; Empowerment
ID TRANSPARENCY; IMPACT
AB Background: India has been at the forefront of innovations around social accountability mechanisms in improving the delivery of public services, including health and nutrition. Yet little is known about how such initiatives are faring now that they are incorporated formally into government programmes and implemented at scale. This brings greater impetus to understand their effectiveness. This formative qualitative study focuses on how such mechanisms have sought to strengthen community-level nutrition and health services (the Integrated Child Development Services and the National Rural Health Mission) in the state of Odisha. It fills a gap in the literature on considering how such initiatives are running when institutionalised at scale. The primary research questions were 'what kinds of community level mechanisms are functioning in randomly selected villages in 3 districts of state of Odisha' and 'how are they perceived to function by their members and frontline workers'.
   Methods: The study is based on focus group discussions with pregnant women and mothers of children below the age of 2 (n = 12) and with women's self-help groups (n = 12); interviews with frontline health workers (n = 24) and with members of community committees (n = 36). Interviews were analysed thematically using a priori coding derived from wider literature on key accountability themes.
   Results: Four main types of community-based mechanisms were examined - Mothers committees, Jaanch committees, Village Health and Sanitation Committees and Self-Help Groups. The degree of their effectiveness varied depending on their ability to offer meaningful avenues for participation of their members and empower women for autonomous action. Notably, in most of these mechanisms community participation is very weak, with committees largely controlled by the frontline workers who are supposed to be held to account. However, self-help groups showed real levels of autonomy and collective power. Despite not having an explicit accountability role, these groups were nevertheless effective in advocating for better service delivery and the broader needs of their members to a level not seen in institutional committees.
   Conclusions: The study points to the need for community-level mechanisms in India to adequately address issues of participation and empowerment of community members to be successful in contributing to service improvements in health and nutrition.

AB Background: Burnout and the intention to leave the profession are frequently studied outcomes in healthcare settings that have not been investigated together and across different health professions before. This study aimed to examine work-related explanatory factors or predictors of burnout and the intention to leave the profession among health professionals in general, and nurses and physicians in particular.
   Methods: Cross-sectional survey data of 1840 employees of six public hospitals and rehabilitation clinics recorded in 2015/16 in German-speaking Switzerland were used. Multiple logistic and stepwise linear regression analyses were performed to estimate the relative risks (odds ratios) and standardized effects (beta coefficients) of different workloads and work-related stressors on these outcomes and to study any possible mediation between them.
   Results: On average, one in twelve health professionals showed increased burnout symptoms and every sixth one thought frequently of leaving the profession. Temporal, physical, emotional and mental workloads and job stresses were strongly and positively associated with burnout symptoms and thoughts of leaving the profession. However, the relative risks of increased burnout symptoms and frequent thoughts of leaving the profession were highest in the case of effort-reward and work-life imbalances. In fact, these two work-related stress measures partly or even largely mediated the relationships between exposures (workloads, job stresses) and outcomes and were found to be the strongest predictors of all. Whereas a work-life imbalance most strongly predicted burnout symptoms among health professionals (beta = .35), and particularly physicians (beta = .48), an effort-reward imbalance most strongly predicted thoughts of leaving the profession (beta = .31-36). A substantial part of the variance was explained in the fully specified regression models across both major health professions and both outcomes. However, explained variance was most pronounced for burnout symptoms of physicians (43.3%) and for frequent thoughts of leaving the profession among nurses and midwives (28.7%).
   Conclusions: Reducing workload and job stress, and particularly reward frustration at work, as well as the difficulties in combining work and private lives among health professionals, may help to prevent them from developing burnout and/or leaving the profession and consequently also to reduce turnover, early retirement, career endings and understaffing in healthcare settings.

TI Implementing large-scale health system strengthening interventions:
   experience from the better health outcomes through mentoring and
   assessments (BHOMA) project in Zambia
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Health system; Implementation; Zambia; Information system
ID NORMALIZATION PROCESS THEORY
AB Background: Under the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation's African Health Initiative, five Population Health Implementation and Training partnerships were established as long-term health system strengthening projects in five Sub-Saharan Countries. In Zambia, the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia began to implement the Better Health Outcomes through Mentorship and Assessments (BHOMA) in 2009. This was a combined community and health systems project involving 42 public facilities and their catchment populations. The impact of this intervention is reported elsewhere, but less attention has been paid to evaluation approaches that generate an understanding of the forces shaping the intervention. This paper is focused on understanding the implementation practices of the BHOMA intervention in Zambia.
   Methods: Qualitative approaches were employed to understand and explain health systems intervention implementation practices between 2014 and 2016. We purposively sampled six clinics out of the 42 that participated in the BHOMA project within three districts of Lusaka province in Zambia. At the facility-level we targeted health centre in-charges, health workers, and community health workers. In-depth interviews (n = 22), focus group discussions (n = 3) and observations were also collected and synthesised.
   Results: The major health system challenges addressed by the BHOMA project included poor infrastructure, lack of human resources, poor service delivery, long distances to health centres and inadequate health information systems. In order to implement this in the districts it was necessary to engage with the Ministry of Health and district managers, however, these partners were not actively engaged in intervention design There was great variation in perceptions about the BHOMA interventions. The implementation team considered BHOMA as a 'proof of concept pilot project', running parallel to the public health system, while district health officials from the Ministry of health understood it as a 'long term partner' and were therefore resistant to the short-term nature of the intervention.
   Conclusions: The Normalization Process Theory provided a useful framework to understand and explain implementation processes for the BHOMA intervention in Zambia. We clearly demonstrated the applicability of all the four main components of the NPT: coherence (or sense-making); cognitive participation (or engagement); collective action and reflexive monitoring. We demonstrated how complex and dynamic the intervention played out among different actors and how implementation was affected by difference in appreciation and interpretation of the goal of the intervention. Our findings support the growing demand for process evaluations to use theory based approaches to examine how context interact with local interventions to affect outcomes intended or not.

TI Regulatory initiatives to reduce sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) in
   Latin America
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID OBESITY PREVENTION; POLICY OPTIONS; FOOD; ENVIRONMENT; LESSONS; TAX
AB Background and objectives
   Latin American (LA) countries have begun to adopt a variety of regulations targeting sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) for public health reasons. Our objective was to characterize the regulatory strategies designed to reduce SSB consumption over the last decade, and assess the available evidence on their enforcement and impact.
   Methods
   We searched legal and public health databases for public and private SSBs regulations in 14 LA countries and then conducted a systematic review of the available literature. We tracked comparative variations in the type of body issuing the regulations, their scope, and binding status. We present data following a 5-category framework we named NUTRE that classifies SSBs regulations as: (1) restrictions to SSB availability in schools (N), (2) taxes and other economic incentives to discourage consumption (U), (3) restrictions on advertising and marketing (T), (4) regulations on government procurement and subsidies (R), and (5) product labeling rules (E).
   Results
   Since 2006, 14 LA countries have adopted at least 39 public and private SSB regulatory initiatives across the NUTRE framework. Comprehensive efforts have only been approved by Chile, Mexico and Ecuador, while the rest have comparatively few initiatives. 28 out of the 39 regulatory initiatives were passed by legislative and executive bodies; 11 initiatives represent self-regulatory undertakings by the beverage industries. An 86% (24/28) of public sector regulations are binding; 56% (22/39) contain explicit monitoring or evaluation methods; and 62% (24/39) provide for sanctions. Moreover, 23 regulations specify the body in charge of monitoring the new rules and standards.
   Conclusions
   LA countries are targeting SSB consumption through a variety of mechanisms, particularly via restrictions to availability in schools and through taxes. Interdisciplinary evidence comparing alternative regulatory strategies is scarce, and few studies offer data on impact and implementation challenges. More evidence and further comparative assessments are needed to support future decision-making.

AB Public policy planning associated with the management of the Science, Technology, and Innovation is decisive to improve public health. It is important to develop novel strategies to plan, supervise, manage, use and evaluate research using indicators that extrapolates metrics in current use. In 2011, the Brazilian government introduced the Brazil Without Extreme Poverty plan (BWEP) that aimed to integrate several conditional cash transfer programs (CCT). The original that aimed to integrate of the CCTs were expanded in order to integrate social justice and dignity that induced several actions towards the promotion of social development of the beneficiaries. An induced action involved a partnership between BWEP (From the Ministry of Social Development), CAPES (Brazilian Higher Education Agency) and The Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ, a Public Health Institution), that dedicated scholarships for PhD and postdoc students committed to the BWEP to promote health research in its multiple approaches and the vulnerable associated population. Using the Social Studies of Science and Technology (SSST) framework, this paper analyzes the dynamics of knowledge production in the context of program implementation. Herein, we report on the follow-up activities performed in BWEP Health Action, directing research projects to align with the goals of the program, evaluating the progress of these research, and defining strategies for improved their management. We analyze the advances and difficulties encountered in the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of this innovative program in the academic training level, and we emphasize the critical need to expand and improve similar initiatives aimed at guiding the scientific and technological production in health to meet the social demands.

AB The present study aimed to identify factors associated with retention in HIV/AIDS care among migrant patients who visited the outpatient clinic of the AIDS Clinical Center, National Center for Global Health and Medicine in Tokyo, Japan. We reviewed the records of 551 selected (78 non-Japanese and 473 Japanese) patients who started visiting our clinic between 2011 and 2014. A total of 390 patients (70.8%: 38 non-Japanese and 352 Japanese) continued their visits during the study: from the date of their first visit to the end of 2015. The difference in retention rate was not significant (Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) = 0.89, p = 0.27), but the loss-to-follow-up cases were considerably high among non-Japanese patients (n = 13, Incidence rate (IR) = 24.6 per 100,000 person-days, IRR = 3.65, p<0.01 after adjusting for time since diagnosis). The results showed, nevertheless, that there was no apparent association between retention and factors peculiar to non-Japanese. Twelve out of thirteen lost-to-follow-up non-Japanese patients held legal status to reside in Japan and were eligible for public health services. Nine had limited fluency in Japanese language, and six used alternative verbal communication. Further studies are needed to identify the factors responsible for the high dropout rate and to improve the care of migrant patients living with HIV/AIDS.

TI Social capital insights from Healthy Settings needs assessment in Malawi
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Despite global health improvements, substantial challenges in social determinants of health and poverty remain in rural communities in low-income countries. Public health theorists suggest that communities with high social capital are less vulnerable to such challenges and more likely to participate in community development. This research examines levels of social capital amongst rural communities in southern Malawi through data gathered as part of a participatory needs assessment for a Healthy Settings project, and discusses the potential benefits of having access to such data before project implementation. Social capital data was collected during 108 focus group discussions in 18 communities (split by gender, age, status) by adapting an existing mixed methods measurement tool, the Schutte tool. Five indicators were measured: sense of belonging, friendship, reliance, ability to work together and influence. Mean results showed all 18 communities had medium-high levels of social capital. Means from each group in the 18 communities highlighted the lowest social capital among the youth groups and the highest with the leaders. A more detailed breakdown highlighted that all groups had a strong sense of belonging to the community, while youth and women had lower social capital levels in terms of influence over local decisions and ability to rely on other community members. Incorporating social capital tools into community health needs assessments in low-income settings provides a valuable overview of community dynamics before project implementation, and Monitoring & Evaluation indicators which allow changes in social capital to be measured at different stages of the project.

AB Background: Several studies have demonstrated that Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) programs reduce poverty/inequity and childhood mortality. However, none of these studies investigated the link between CCT programs and children's oral health. This study examines the association between receiving the Brazilian conditional cash transfer, Bolsa Familia Program (BFP), and the oral health of five-year-old children in the Northeast of Brazil.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study with 230 caregivers/children randomly selected in primary health care clinics in the city of Fortaleza in 2016. Interviews and oral health examinations were performed. Descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with dental caries among five-year-old children enrolled in the BFP.
   Results: Around 40% of children enrolled in the BFP had dental caries. However, those who received Bolsa Familia (BF) for a period up to two years (OR = 0.13, 95% CI 0.05-0.35) had substantially lower adjusted odds of having dental caries than those who had never received BF. In addition, the association of BF and dental caries was more prominent among extremely poor families (OR = 0.05, 95% CI 0.01-0.28).
   Conclusions: Although initial enrolment in the BFP predicted low dental caries among five-year-old children, the prevalence of dental caries in this population is still high, thus, public health programs should target BF children's oral health. An ongoing effort should be made to reduce oral health inequalities among children in Brazil.

TI Higher low back and neck pain in final year Swiss health professions'

   comparison to the national population

AB Background: Low back pain (LBP) and neck pain (NP) are of considerable socioeconomic burden. Considering the escalating demand on health services that LBP and NP have globally, they represent an arguably unsustainable drain on resources with the projected increased demand secondary to an ageing population. Identifying populations at risk for LBP and NP may inform public health prevention strategies. Health professions' (HP) students may be more susceptible due to their demographic factors and potentially risky postural demands of their education and formative clinical practice. The aim of our study was to compare self-reported LBP and NP of HP students with the general and stratified Swiss population to identify their prevalence. In addition, we compared the prevalence of LBP and NP in students studying different professions in order to identify whether susceptibilities exist.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional study, self-reported LBP and NP reported by final-year HP students (n = 1848) were compared with the Swiss national population aged >= 15 years living in private households (n = 21 ,597). Binary regression models estimated crude prevalence and prevalence adjusted for age, gender, and education. Design-based F-Tests assessed differences between students and the Swiss population.
   Results: Crude, overall four-week (4w) prevalence (mean (95% Cls)) for LBP was 61.0% (58.4-63.5) in all HP students versus 40.0% (392-40.9) in the Swiss population. Female HP students aged 21-30 years (633% (60.5-66.1)) reported higher LBP than the same-aged Swiss female population with secondary (43.7% (39.5-47.9)) or tertiary (36.6% (30.8-42.9)) education. Crude, overall 4w prevalence for NP was 59.8% (572-62.3) in all HP students versus 36.4% (35.6-37.3) in the Swiss population. Female health professions' students aged 21-30 years reported higher NP (63.2% (60.4-66.0)) than the same-aged Swiss female population with secondary (36.6% (32.7-40.8)) or tertiary (35.4% (29.6-41.8)) education. The inter-professional differences shown indicate midwifery to be most susceptible to reporting both conditions.
   Conclusions: Considerably higher LBP and NP were reported by final year HP students when compared with the general and stratified Swiss population. Worrying inter-professional susceptibilities were shown and reveal the need for further explanatory studies. Measures to reduce complex health problems like LBP and NP should be introduced into curricula in order to optimize the longevity of clinical careers and to protect the future HP workforce.

AB Background: Long waiting times are associated with public community outpatient health services. This trial aimed to determine if a new model of care based on evidence-based strategies that improved patient flow in two small pilot trials could be used to reduce waiting time across a variety of services. The key principle of the Specific Timely Appointments for Triage (STAT) model is that patients are booked directly into protected assessment appointments and triage is combined with initial management as an alternative to a waiting list and triage system.
   Methods: A stepped wedge cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted between October 2015 and March 2017, involving 3116 patients at eight sites across a major Australian metropolitan health network.
   Results: The intervention reduced waiting time to first appointment by 33.8% (IRR = 0.663, 95% CI 0.516 to 0.852, P = 0.001). Median waiting time decreased from a median of 42 days (IQR 19 to 86) in the control period to a median of 24 days (IQR 13 to 48) in the intervention period. A substantial reduction in variability was also noted. The model did not impact on most secondary outcomes, including time to second appointment, likelihood of discharge by 12 weeks and number of appointments provided, but was associated with a small increase in the rate of missed appointments.
   Conclusions: Broad-scale implementation of a model of access and triage that combined triage with initial management and actively managed the relationship between supply and demand achieved substantial reductions in waiting time without adversely impacting on other aspects of care. The reductions in waiting time are likely to have been driven, primarily, by substantial reductions for those patients previously considered low priority.

AB Background: Strongyloidiasis is prevalent in northeast Thailand. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the Health Education and Preventive Equipment Package (HEPEP), a package we developed to improve awareness and aid in the prevention of Strongyloides stercoralis infection among rural communities in northeast Thailand.
   Methods: This was an intervention trial conducted in 12 villages (six interventions and six controls) in rural areas of northeast Thailand from March 2016 to September 2017. Single stool sample was collected from each participant and examined using agar plate culture (APC) technique. Each participant was interviewed using a pre-tested questionnaire, treated with single dose of ivermectin (200 mu g/Kg), and allocated to either the intervention or control group. Members of the intervention group were given "Practices to Prevent Strongyloidiasis" poster and vinyl boards containing information aimed at raising awareness of S. stercoralis and strongyloidiasis. In addition, they were given a poster lecture regarding the lifecycle of S. stercoralis before being treated with ivermectin. Aside from that, they were also given a protective equipment package. Monthly refresher courses were provided by village health volunteers (VI-IVs) regarding the health information they had received and proper equipment usage. The control group, on the other hand, was only provided with a five-minute lecture regarding strongyloidiasis. Assessment of new infection was conducted 3 months later in 327 and 318 participants in the intervention group and control group, respectively.
   Results: The HEPEP had 41% greater efficacy in preventing S. stercoralis infection in the intervention group than the measures taken in the control group (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) = 0.59; 95%CI : 0.41 to 0.85, P-value = 0.005). The intervention group also scored significantly higher on all aspects of a test of S. stercoralis knowledge compared with the control group (mean difference (mean dif.) = 2.89, P-value = < 0.05).
   Conclusions: The HEPEP was the first model that has been found to be effective in controlling of S. stercoralis in rural communities in the northeast Thailand. The results should encourage policy makers and public health personnel to improve control programs, as well as health promotion, with regard to parasites.

TI The Why We Retweet scale
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL MEDIA; RELIABILITY
AB Background
   Twitter offers a platform for rapid diffusion of information and its users' attitudes and behaviors. Insights about information propagation via retweets (the message forwarding function) offer observable explanations of ways in which modern human interactions get organized in the form of online networks, and contextualized in the form of public health, policy decisions, disaster management, and civic participation. This study conceptualized and validated the Why We Retweet Scale to contextualize retweeting behavior.
   Objective
   Twitter users were identified using clustering algorithms that consider a users' position in their network and invited for an online survey. Participants (N = 1433) responded to 19 questions about why they retweet. Exploratory factor Analysis (EFA) was conducted on a scale development sample (70% of original sample), which informed the Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) on a scale testing sample (30% of the original sample). Varimax rotation was used to obtain a rotated factor solution, which resulted in interpretable factors. Demographic differences among scale factors were analyzed using one-way ANOVA or independent samples t-tests.

   The final model (chi(2)(21)= 28, RMSEA = .03 [90% CI, 0.00-0.06], CFA = .99, TLI = 0.99) represented a parsimonious solution with 4 factors, measured by 2-3 items each, creating a final scale consisting of 9 items. Factor labels and definitions were: (1) Show approval, "Show support to the tweeter"; (2) Argue, "To argue against a tweet that I disagree with"; (3) Gain attention, "Add followers or gain attention"; and (4) Entertain, "Create humor/amusement". Demographic differences were also reported.
   Conclusions
   The Why We Retweet Scale offers a useful conceptualization and assessment of motivations for retweeting. In the future, communication strategists might consider the factors associated with information propagation when designing campaign messages to maximize message reach and engagement on Twitter.

AB Background
   Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of public health challenges among immigrant refugees and their surrounding communities in developing countries. Evaluating the treatment outcome of TB patients is one of the key indicators to understand the performance of TB control program. Hence, this study aims to assess profile, treatment outcome and factors associated with unsuccessful outcome of TB patients treated under the TB control program among refugees and their surrounding communities (SCs) in Gambella Regional State, Ethiopia.
   Methodology
   Retrospective study was conducted in the health facilities of refugee and their SCs in Gambella Regional State from March 1 to May 30, 2017. Demographic and related data of all TB patients registered in TB Control Program between September, 2008 and October, 2017 in health facilities of refugee and the SCs was extracted using data extraction format. Eight years trend of TB, treatment outcome and factors associated with unsuccessful outcome among refugees and the SCs were computed using SPSS version 20.0 software.
   Result
   A total of 886 refugees and 3284 SCs TB patients, registered for anti TB treatment in the last eight years, were evaluated in the study. The trend of all forms of TB is progressively increasing among refugees contrary to the SCs in the course of the study period (X-2 trend = 207.7; P<0.0001). Smear positive pulmonary TB (PTB+) was found to be predominant (57.6%) TB form in refugees while smear negative pulmonary TB (PTB-) (44.8%) is in the SCs (X-2 = 185.834; P<0.0001). There was also significant difference in the treatment outcome (X-2 = 170.915; P<0.0001). Mean treatment success rate was 74.2% and 88.1% for refugees and the SCs, respectively (X-2 = 92.887; P<0.0001). The study also revealed that the risk of unsuccessful TB treatment outcome was significantly higher among refugee (AOR = 2.17; 95% CI: 1.69-2.77), retreated cases (AOR = 1.53; 95% CI: 1.07-2.17), patients aged between 35-44 years (AOR = 1.38; 95% CI: 1.0-1.91), and greater than 44 years old (AOR = 1.77; 95% CI: 1.28-2.44), and patients with extra pulmonary TB (EPTB) form (AOR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.04-1.73) compared to their counterparts. Patient coming from rural area (AOR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.62-0.97), who are female (AOR = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.63-0.91) and TB/HIV non-infected (AOR = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.51-0.77) were more likely to be successfully treated.
   Conclusion
   The study confirmed that there was low treatment success rate among refugees compared to the SCs. Being refugee, retreated case, patient's age. 35 years old, EPTB form, gender, rural patient address and HIV status were predictor factors for unsuccessful treatment outcome. Hence, the study urges the need for strengthened TB prevention program among refugees with due consideration of identified predictor factors to prevent the potential effect of hosting refugee to the SCs and the nations at large.

AB Background: A sequence of annual measles epidemics has been observed from January 2013 to April 2017 in the South West Shoa Zone of the Oromia Region, Ethiopia. We aimed at estimating the burden of disease in the affected area, taking into account inequalities in access to health care due to travel distances from the nearest hospital.
   Methods: We developed a dynamic transmission model calibrated on the time series of hospitalized measles cases. The model provided estimates of disease transmissibility and incidence at a population level. Model estimates were combined with a spatial analysis to quantify the hidden burden of disease and to identify spatial heterogeneities characterizing the effectiveness of the public health system in detecting severe measles infections and preventing deaths.
   Results: A total of 1819 case patients and 36 deaths were recorded at the hospital. The mean age was 6.0 years (range, 0-65). The estimated reproduction number was 16.5 (95% credible interval (CI) 14.5-183) with a cumulative disease incidence of 2.34% (95% CI 2.06-2.66). Three thousand eight hundred twenty-one (95% CI 1969-5671) severe cases, including 2337 (95% CI 716-4009) measles-related deaths, were estimated in the Woliso hospital's catchment area (521,771 inhabitants). The case fatality rate was found to remarkably increase with travel distance from the nearest hospital: ranging from 0.6% to more than 19% at 20 km. Accordingly, hospital treatment prevented 1049 (95% CI 757-1342) deaths in the area.
   Conclusions: Spatial heterogeneity in the access to health care can dramatically affect the burden of measles disease in low-income settings. In sub-Saharan Africa, passive surveillance based on hospital admitted cases might miss up to 60% of severe cases and 98% of related deaths.

AB BackgroundRecent global progress in scaling up malaria control interventions has revived the goal of complete elimination in many countries. Decreasing transmission intensity generally leads to increasingly patchy spatial patterns of malaria transmission in elimination settings, with control programs having to accurately identify remaining foci in order to efficiently target interventions.FindingsThe role of connectivity between different pockets of local transmission is of increasing importance as programs near elimination since humans are able to transfer parasites beyond the limits of mosquito dispersal, thus re-introducing parasites to previously malaria-free regions. Here, we discuss recent advances in the quantification of spatial epidemiology of malaria, particularly Plasmodium falciparum, in the context of transmission reduction interventions. Further, we highlight the challenges and promising directions for the development of integrated mapping, modeling, and genomic approaches that leverage disparate datasets to measure both connectivity and transmission.ConclusionA more comprehensive understanding of the spatial transmission of malaria can be gained using a combination of parasite genetics and epidemiological modeling and mapping. However, additional molecular and quantitative methods are necessary to answer these public health-related questions.

AB Background: Depression is an important public health concern due to its devastating morbidity and mortality among older adults. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of depression and associated factors among older adults (age >= 60 years) in Ambo Town, Ethiopia, 2016.
   Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among older adults in Ambo town from May to June 2016. Geriatric depression scale item 15 (GDS 15) was used to conduct face-to-face interviews with 800 study participants. Data were entered into Epi Info version 7 and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression analysis were employed. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval was used to calculate significance.
   Results: The prevalence of depression was found to be 41.8% [CI = 38.5%, 45.5%]. The multivariable logistic regression model revealed that female sex (AOR = 1.72; 95% CI = 1.12, 2.66), trading (AOR = 2.44; 95% CI =1.32, 4.57), living with children (AOR = 3.19, 95% CI =1.14, 8.93) and retirement (AOR = 3.94, 95% CI = 2.11, 7.35) were associated with depression among older adults.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of depression among older adult was found to be high. Due emphasis needs to be given to screening and treating depression, especially among older females, retired individuals, adults living with children and merchants.

AB Infectious diseases continue to pose a significant public health burden despite the great progress achieved in their prevention and control over the last few decades. Our ability to disentangle the factors and mechanisms driving their propagation in space and time has dramatically advanced in recent years. The current era is rich in mathematical and computational tools and detailed geospatial information, including sociodemographic, geographic, and environmental data, which are essential to elucidate key drivers of infectious disease transmission from epidemiological and genetic data. Indeed, this paradigm shift was driven by dramatic advances in complex systems approaches along with substantial improvements in data availability and computational power. The burgeoning output of infectious disease spatial modeling suggests that we are close to a fully integrated approach for early epidemic detection and intervention. This special collection in BMC Medicine aims to bring together a broad range of quantitative investigations that improve our understanding of the spatiotemporal transmission dynamics of infectious diseases in order to mitigate their impact on the human population.

AB Background: Local mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission has been reported in two counties in the contiguous United States (US), prompting the issuance of travel, prevention, and testing guidance across the contiguous US. Large uncertainty, however, surrounds the quantification of the actual risk of ZIKV introduction and autochthonous transmission across different areas of the US.
   Methods: We present a framework for the projection of ZIKV autochthonous transmission in the contiguous US during the 2015-2016 epidemic using a data-driven stochastic and spatial epidemic model accounting for seasonal, environmental, and detailed population data. The model generates an ensemble of travel-related case counts and simulates their potential to have triggered local transmission at the individual level in the 2015-2016 ZIKV epidemic.
   Results: We estimate the risk of ZIKV introduction and local transmission at the county level and at the 0.025 degrees x 0.025 degrees cell level across the contiguous US. We provide a risk measure based on the probability of observing local transmission in a specific location during a ZIKV epidemic modeled after the epidemic observed during the years 2015-2016. The high spatial and temporal resolution of the model allows us to generate statistical estimates of the number of ZIKV introductions leading to local transmission in each location. We find that the risk was spatially heterogeneously distributed and concentrated in a few specific areas that account for less than 1% of the contiguous US population. Locations in Texas and Florida that have actually experienced local ZIKV transmission were among the places at highest risk according to our results. We also provide an analysis of the key determinants for local transmission and identify the key introduction routes and their contributions to ZIKV transmission in the contiguous US.
   Conclusions: This framework provides quantitative risk estimates, fully captures the stochasticity of ZIKV introduction events, and is not biased by the under-ascertainment of cases due to asymptomatic cases. It provides general information on key risk determinants and data with potential uses in defining public health recommendations and guidance about ZIKV risk in the US.

AB BackgroundMore patients are dying in non-palliative care settings than in palliative care settings. How health care providers care for adult patients at the end-of-life stage in non-palliative care settings has not been adequately explored. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of health care providers in caring for patients at the end-of-life stage in non-palliative care settings.MethodsThis is a qualitative study. Twenty-six health care providers from eight health care institutions which are based in Shanghai were interviewed individually between August 2016 and February 2017. Three levels of health care, i.e., acute care, sub-acute care, or primary care, was provided in the health care institutions. The interviews were analyzed using qualitative content analysis.ResultsThree themes emerged from the interviews: (i) Definition of the end-of-life stage: This is mainly defined based on a change in treatment. (ii) Health care at the end-of-life stage: Most patients spent their last weeks in tertiary/secondary hospitals, transferring from one location to another and receiving disease- and symptom-focused treatment. Family-dominated decision making was common when discussing treatment options. Nurses instinctively provided extra care attention to patients, but nursing care is still task-oriented. (iii) Challenges, difficulties, and the future. From the interviews, it was found that pressure from families was the main challenge faced by health care providers. Three urgent tasks before the end-of-life care can become widely available in the future were identified from the interviews, including educating the public on death, extending government support, and creating better health care environment.ConclusionThe end-of-life care system of the future should involve health care institutions at all levels, with established mechanisms of collaboration between institutions. Care should be delivered to patients with various life-threatening diseases in both palliative and non-palliative care settings. But first, it is necessary to address the obstacles to the development of end-of-life care, which involve health care providers, patients and their families, and the health care system as a whole.

AB Over the past few decades, a growing body of epidemiological studies found the effects of temperature on cardiovascular disease, including the risk for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Our study aimed to investigate whether there is an association between extremely temperature and acute myocardial infarction hospital admission in Beijng, China. We obtained 81029 AMI cases and daily temperature data from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016. We employed a time series design and modeled distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) to analyze effects of temperature on daily AMI cases. Compared with the 10th percentile temperature measured by daily mean temperature (Tmean), daily minimum temperature (Tmin) and daily minimum apparent temperature (Armin), the cumulative relative risks (CRR) at 1st percentile of Tmean, Tmin and ATmin for AMI hospitalization were 1.15(95% CI: 1.02, 1.30), 1.24(95% CI: 1.11, 1.38) and 1.41(95% CI: 1.18, 1.68), respectively. Moderate low temperature (10th vs 25th) also had adverse impact on AMI events. The susceptive groups were males and people 65 years and older. No associations were found between high temperature and AMI risk. The main limitation of the study is temperature exposure was not individualized. These findings on cold-associated AMI hospitalization helps characterize the public health burden of cold and target interventions to reduce temperature induced AMI occurrence.

AB Recent years have witnessed greater involvement of European Union (EU) organisations in health communication campaigns that address chronic diseases and that are designed for implementation in multiple countries. This development raises challenges inherent in adapting the design of public health communication campaigns to multi-national settings. This article provides a first exploratory investigation of these challenges and how to address them based on data gathered from four expert focus groups, each concentrated on a common risk factor for chronic disease: smoking, alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet and sedentary lifestyle. Despite the exploratory nature of the data, it was possible to identify several common key challenges: variation in behaviours, social and cultural norms, and issues related to language and communication channels, the divide between EU stakeholders and local actors, and differences in national legislation and available resources. Two risk factor specific challenges were also identified: effective messaging for complex issues (unhealthy diet) and the involvement of industry representatives (smoking, sedentary lifestyle). We propose conceiving of cross-national communication campaigns as providing a common blueprint and structure that can inform and support the development of differentiated yet harmonised local campaigns.

DE Surgeons; Health promotion; Professional practice; Hospitals; Attitude

AB BackgroundThe high prevalence of non-communicable diseases places significant demands on the healthcare system. As a result, hospitals are seeking to broaden their role to include more integrated health promotion. Strong leadership at different levels of the organisation is required for the successful integration of health promotion in hospital settings. The status of surgeons within healthcare affords them significant influence over clinical practice, and by extension, institutional policy and practice. The voice of this professional group is, however, absent from preventative health literature. The aim of this research is to identify which health promotion activities surgeons undertake, and to explore the attitudes of the profession towards health promotion activities.MethodsA mixed methods study will be conducted, guided by the principles of sequential explanatory design. Quantitative results from a clinician survey will be followed by in-depth, semi structured interviews to explore findings in more depth through qualitative analysis. We will recruit from general and orthopaedic surgeons and registrars in a major tertiary hospital in a regional city in Australia (n approximate to 31). Data will be collected, independently coded and analysed using a qualitative descriptive approach. Quantitative and qualitative results will be merged during interpretation to provide complementary perspectives of interrelated contextual factors that influence health promotion activities amongst hospital surgeons.DiscussionThe depth of insight gained from these highly professionalised clinicians will offer a distinctive perspective on current practice, as well as the challenges of implementing effective health promotion into surgical practice. The findings from this research will assist in guiding strategy and policy at both clinical and institutional levels on health promotion planning and practice. Gaining insights from surgeons will strengthen the evidence base to assist the integration of health promotion into hospital practice.

AB BackgroundMultiple risk behaviour (MRB) refers to two or more risk behaviours such as smoking, drinking alcohol, poor diet and unsafe sex. Such behaviours are known to co-occur in adolescence. It is unknown whether MRB interventions are equally effective for young people of low and high socioeconomic status (SES). There is a need to examine these effects to determine whether MRB interventions have the potential to narrow or widen inequalities.MethodsTwo Cochrane systematic reviews that examined interventions to reduce adolescent MRB were screened to identify universal interventions that reported SES. Study authors were contacted, and outcome data stratified by SES and intervention status were requested. Risk behaviour outcomes alcohol use, smoking, drug use, unsafe sex, overweight/obesity, sedentarism, peer violence and dating violence were examined in random effects meta-analyses and subgroup analyses conducted to explore differences between high SES and low SES adolescents.ResultsOf 49 studies reporting universal interventions, only 16 also reported having measured SES. Of these 16 studies, four study authors provided data sufficient for subgroup analysis. There was no evidence of subgroup differences for any of the outcomes. For alcohol use, the direction of effect was the same for both the high SES group (RR 1.26, 95% CI: 0.96, 1.65, p=0.09) and low SES group (RR 1.14, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.32, p=0.08). The direction of effect was different for smoking behaviour in favour of the low SES group (RR 0.83, 95% CI: 0.66, 1.03, p=0.09) versus the high SES group (RR 1.16, 95% CI: 0.82, 1.63, p=0.39). For drug use, the direction of effect was the same for both the high SES group (RR 1.29, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.73, p=0.08) and the low SES group (RR 1.28, 95% CI: 0.84, 1.96, p=0.25).ConclusionsThe majority of studies identified did not report having measured SES. There was no evidence of subgroup difference for all outcomes analysed among the four included studies. There is a need for routine reporting of demographic information within studies so that stronger evidence of effect by SES can be demonstrated and that interventions can be evaluated for their impact on health inequalities.

AB Background
   Round-the-clock use of smartphones holds a potential for awakenings and/ or shorter sleep duration, which may have adverse health consequences. We aim to describe overnight smartphone activity among young adults and to characterize those with smartphone interrupted sleep in terms of sleep impairment and mental and physical health indicators.
   Methods
   We use unique objective high-resolution information on timing of smartphone activity (based on >250,000 phone actions) continuously monitored over a four-week period among 815 young adults combined with indicators of mental and physical health.
   Results
   We find substantial overnight smartphone activity. More than 12% had smartphone activity in the middle of the night (3 to 5 hours after self-reported bedtime) and 41% had smartphone interrupted sleep on at least one weekday during a 4-week period. Those with frequent smartphone interrupted sleep had on average 48 minutes shorter self-reported sleep duration and higher body mass index, whereas there were no differences in physical or mental health symptoms.
   Conclusions
   The substantial smartphone activity during bed hours among young adults may pose a public health challenge and especially the relation to overweight warrants close attention.

AB BackgroundGlobally, depressive disorders are one of the most common forms of mental illness. Using data from the most recent Global Burden of Disease, Injury, and Risk Factor Study 2016 (GBD 2016), we aimed to describe the burden of disease attributable to depressive disorders in terms of prevalence and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in South Asia countries (namely India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan).MethodsGBD 2016 used epidemiological data on depressive disorders (major depression and dysthymia) from South Asia and a Bayesian meta-regression tool (DisMod-MR 2.1) to model prevalence and DALYs of depressive disorders by age, sex, country and year. DALYs were calculated from the years lived with disability (YLDs), derived from the prevalence of depressive disorders and disability weights, obtained from a community and internet-based surveys. The analyses adjusted for comorbidity, data sources and multiple modelling, and estimates were presented with 95% uncertainty intervals (UI).ResultsIn 2016, the age-standardised prevalence of depressive disorders in South Asia was 3.9% (95% UI: 3.6-4.2%), 4.4% (95% UI: 4.4-4.8%) in Bangladesh, 3.9% (95% UI: 3.6-4.2%) in India, 3.0% (95% UI: 2.8-3.3%) in Pakistan, 4.0% (95% UI: 3.7-4.3%) in Nepal and 3.7% (95% UI: 3.4-4.1%) in Bhutan. In South Asia, depressive disorders accounted for 9.8 million DALYs (95% UI: 6.8-13.2 million) or 577.8 (95% UI: 399.9-778.9) per 100,000 population in 2016. Of these, major depressive disorders (MDD) accounted for 7.8 million DALYs (95% UI: 5.3-10.5 million). India generated the largest numbers of DALYs due to depressive disorders and MDD, followed by Bangladesh and Pakistan. DALYs due to depressive disorders were highest in females and older adults (75-79years) across all countries.ConclusionOur findings show the substantial public health burden of depressive disorders in South Asian populations and healthcare systems. Given the scale of depressive disorders, improvement in overall population health is possible if South Asian countries prioritise the prevention and treatment of depressive disorders.

AB BackgroundIn recent decades, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has seen an exponentially growing antibiotic resistance, which is exacerbated by the use of antibiotics without a prescription and other various factors. However, no published data are available on factors influencing non-prescription use of antibiotics among the general public in Saudi Arabia using an in-depth interview technique.MethodsSemi-structured interviews were carried out with 40 Saudi participants from the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, selected via snowball sampling technique. Participants were enrolled based on the following inclusion criteria: 18years of age or older and had self-medicated themselves with antibiotics in the past two years. Data collection was continued until data saturation was attained. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim and analysed using NVivo 10 software.ResultsParticipants (80% female) had a mean (SD) age of 30years (10.2). Self-medication with antibiotics was associated with various inappropriate antibiotic use behaviours and negative outcomes such as antibiotic resistance, treatment failures and adverse events. Interviews revealed that different reasons contribute to the rise of self-medication with antibiotics, ranging from difficulty accessing healthcare services, participant's cultural beliefs and practices, lack of knowledge about antibiotics and antibiotic resistance, and weak regulatory enforcement.ConclusionsThe findings of the present study will aid in generating data that may provide an insight when designing future interventions to promote public health awareness regarding safe and effective use of antibiotics.

AB BackgroundBeing overweight and obesity during adolescence are worldwide public health problems. This study examined the relationship between actual weight, body image, and emotional and behavioral problems among Chinese adolescents.MethodsA total of 3841 adolescents (age range, 11-16years) from 5 Chinese cities were included in this cross-sectional study. All of the study participants were asked to complete questionnaires (including demographic features, strengths and difficulties questionnaires, pubertal development scale), and their height and weight were measured at the same time. Body image was measured in two ways: self-perceived weight and body satisfaction. The relationship between weight status and mental health was estimated by multivariate logistic regression for boys and girls.ResultsOur study showed a difference by sex for prevalence of being overweight/obesity and body dissatisfaction among Chinese adolescents. Boys were more likely to be overweight or obese than girls (30.4% vs. 21.5%, p<0.05), but girls were more likely to be dissatisfied with their bodies than boys (41.2% vs. 27.9%, p<0.05). In the logistic regression, body image, not actually being overweight, was significantly associated with a higher risk of emotional and behavioral problems. Compared to perceived normal weight boys, boys who perceived themselves as underweight had an increased likelihood of emotional problems (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=1.73; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.16-2.57), conduct problems (OR=1.73; 95% CI, 1.20-2.50), and total difficulties (OR=1.50; 95% CI, 1.09-2.05). Compared to body satisfaction, body dissatisfaction was a risk factor for emotional problems (boys: OR=2.80; 95% CI, 1.84-4.25; girls: OR=2.18; 95% CI, 1.42-3.36), conduct problems (boys: OR=1.87, 95% CI, 1.26-2.76; girls: OR=2.79; 95% CI, 1.46-5.30), hyperactivity problems (boys: OR=1.67; 95% CI, 1.09-2.55; girls: OR=2.04; 95% CI, 1.13-3.69), and total difficulties (boys: OR=2.03; 95% CI, 1.45-2.84; girls: OR=2.30; 95% CI, 1.46-3.56).ConclusionsBeing overweight and obese during adolescence are very serious public health problems in China. Body image was a more substantial predictor for adolescent emotional and behavioral problems than actually being overweight/obesity.

AB Many trematode parasites cause infection in humans and are thought to be a major public health problem. Their ecological diversity in different regions provides challenging questions on evolution of these organisms. In this report, we perform transcriptome analysis of the giant intestinal fluke, Fasciolopsis buski, using next generation sequencing technology. Short read sequences derived from polyA containing RNA of this organism were assembled into 30,677 unigenes that led to the annotation of 12,380 genes. Annotation of the assembled transcripts enabled insight into processes and pathways in the intestinal fluke, such as RNAi pathway and energy metabolism. The expressed kinome of the organism was characterized by identifying all protein kinases. A rough draft genome assembly for Fasciolopsis buski is also reported herewith with SRA accessions for crosschecking the findings in the analyzed transcriptome data. Transcriptome data also helped us to identify some of the expressed transposable elements. Though many Long Interspersed elements (LINEs) were identified, only two Short Interspersed Elements (SINEs) were visible. Overall transcriptome and draft genome analysis of F. buski helped us to characterize some of its important biological characteristics and provided enormous resources for development of a suitable diagnostic system and anti-parasitic therapeutic molecules.

TI Applying Corporate Political Activity ( CPA) analysis to Australian

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID PUBLIC-HEALTH POLICY; STRATEGY; MODEL
AB Aims
   This research aimed to assess the application to the gambling industry, of Corporate Political Activity (CPA) analysis previously developed from public health research on tobacco industry interactions with political institutions and previously applied to the alcohol industry, but not the gambling industry.
   Background
   A growing body of literature has confirmed how public interest outcomes are frequently opposed by vested interests. This research focused on gambling industry submissions to a 2013 Australian Parliamentary inquiry into sports betting advertising. Gambling advertising became highly controversial following deregulation of sports betting advertising in Australia subsequent to the 2008 Australian High Court Betfair challenge. The dramatic increase in gambling advertising during sporting event broadcasts at children's viewing times and on new interactive technology, sparked public concerns. A series of national regulatory reviews followed and the gambling industry was actively involved in opposing further regulation.
   Method
   The research used a corporate political activity (CPA) framework of analysis developed by UK tobacco public health researchers, which identified strategies and tactics used internationally by the tobacco industry, to broker pro-tobacco public policy outcomes. Testing the application of this CPA framework to gambling pro-industry strategies/tactics, this research focused on gambling industry submissions to the 2013 Australian Parliamentary Committee Inquiry.
   Results
   Like the tobacco industry, the research found the gambling industry used identified strategies and tactics, some new tactics and a new strategy of 'Corporate Social Responsibility', promoting 'responsible' industry practices and pre-emptive establishment of internal 'responsibility' units/practices. Despite public concerns regarding sports betting advertising, the gambling industry reinforced individual choice/blame for harms and claimed it acted responsibly. It did this using strategies identified in the tobacco industry CPA framework: information strategy (and shaping the evidence base); financial incentive strategy; constituency building strategy; policy substitution strategy; legal strategy; and constituency fragmentation and destabilization strategy.
   Conclusion
   Similar to the CPA analysis applied to tobacco and alcohol industries, the research demonstrated the usefulness of the CPA taxonomy for analyzing and documenting pre-emptive industry policy strategies and tactics, exposing gambling industry efforts to maintain industry self-regulation via voluntary codes and avoid more government regulation. Cross-sectoral application of the framework signals great potential for use of CPA by policymakers and public health advocates as a tool in the analysis of corporate industry arguments/discourses.

AB Background
   Despite the urgent need for new, effective antibiotics, few antibiotics of value have entered the market during the past decades. Therefore, incentives have been developed to stimulate antibiotic R&D. For these incentives to be effective, geographic availability for recently approved antibiotics needs to be better understood. In this study, we analyze geographic availability and market introduction of antibiotics approved between 1999 and 2014.
   Material and method
   We identified antibiotics, considered new chemical entities (NCEs) for systemic use approved globally between 1999 and 2014, from national medicine agencies' lists of approved drugs, and data from the WHO Collaborating Center for Drug Statistics. Geographic availability was mapped using sales data from IQVIA, and analyzed with regards to class, indication, safety, and origin.
   Results
   Of the 25 identified NCEs, only 12 had registered sales in more than 10 countries. NCEs with the widest geographic availability had registered sales in more than 70 countries within a ten-year timeframe and 30 countries within a three-year timeframe, spreading across five different geographic regions and three country income classes. Half (52%) of the NCEs had an indication for infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, little diversity was seen regarding target pathogen and indication. Antibiotics originated from and/or marketed by companies from the US or Europe had greater geographic availability compared to Japanese antibiotics, which seldom reached outside of Asia. For 20 NCEs developers chose to fully or partially sublicense marketing rights to a number of companies of different sizes.
   Conclusion
   Our findings show great variation in geographic availability of antibiotics, indicating that availability in multiple regions and country income classes is possible, but rarely seen within a few years of market authorization. Sublicensing agreements between multiple companies was common practice. Moreover, differences were seen between countries regarding benefit/risk evaluations and company behavior. These findings could be a potential source of uncertainties, and create barriers to assure that working antibiotics are developed and made available according to public health needs.

AB Background
   Quality of service provision in health facilities is fundamental to ensure effective care. However, women's actual experience of care is often neglected.
   Objective
   To assess perceived quality of institutional delivery services and associated factors among women who delivered in public health facilities of Southwest Ethiopia.
   Method
   Community based cross-sectional study was conducted in three districts of Jimma zone, Southwestern Ethiopia, from February 29 to March 20, 2016. A total of 423 mothers who delivered in public health facilities during the last 12 months were selected to participate in the study. Study participants were identified using simple random sampling procedure. Principal component analysis was used to generate scores for three sub-dimensions of perceived quality. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of these sub-dimensions.
   Results
   Perceived quality of institutional delivery services was measured with three dimensions: perceived interpersonal interaction, health care delivery and health facility/structure. We found that perceived quality of interpersonal interaction was negatively affected by educational level (read and write) (beta: -0.331, 95% CI: -0.523, -0.140), urban residence (beta: -0.485, 95% CI: -0.696, -0.275), antenatal care (less than three visits) (beta: -0.238, 95% CI: -0.419,-0.056) and delivery service attended by male provider (beta: -1.286, 95% CI: -1.463,-1.109). Perceived quality of health care delivery was negatively associated with still birth (beta: -0.642, 95% CI: -1.092,-0.193) and delivery services attended by male provider (beta: -0.689, 95% CI: -0.907,-0.472). Urban residence (beta: -0.260, 95% CI: -0.515,-0.005), and antenatal care (less than three visits) (beta: -0.394, 95% CI: -0.628,-0.161) were negatively associated with perceived quality of health facility/structure.
   Conclusion
   Overall, the perceived quality of institutional delivery services was low. We recommend that health managers and health care providers jointly work to transform birth care at the health facilities to deliver person-centered care. Addressing the preferences of clients is as important as taking care of structural concerns pinpointed in this study.

AB Introduction
   Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) impairs respiratory physiology and functional ability, resulting in economic and social dependence upon others. Patients with tuberculosis especially multi drug resistant (MDR-TB) suffer from social isolation, stigma, lack of support and economic constraints. In Ethiopia, the trend of MDR TB is increasing and becoming a serious public health problem. However, little is known about patients except treatment outcomes, financial burden and psychological distress with serious deficiency of data on Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL). Hence, the aim of this study was to assess HRQOL of MDR TB patients in comparison with drug sensitive pulmonary TB (DSTB) patients.
   Methods
   We included 100 cases of MDR and 300 controls with DSTB who were matched by sex. Data were collected using SF- 36v2 TM questionnaire and analysed with SPSS version 20. Independent t-test and conditional logistic regression analysis was done considering P-values of less than 0.05 statistically significant. Eight in-depth interviews were also conducted with both groups and represented with verbatim quotations and narrative texts.
   Results
   There were no statistically significant differences in mean scores for health related quality of life between cases and controls (57.61 +/- 16.42 and 59.13 +/- 22.10) nor were there significant differences in physical functioning, role disruption due to physical problems, vitality, social functioning, role disruption due to emotional distress, or overall mental health. Individuals with MDR-TB were significantly more likely to be single, a current student, and with lower education and families with more than 5 people than individuals with Drug sensitive TB, all of which were significantly associated with poorer HRQOL (p<0.05). There was good internal consistency of the scale scores, with a Cronbach's alpha value of 0.73.
   Conclusion
   Individuals with MDR-TB reported statistically worse general health but less bodily pain than individuals with Drug sensitive TB. To regain the role function they lost, we recommend that health facilities, media and all other stakeholders educate the community, households and students about pulmonary tuberculosis, treatment, prevention methods and therapeutic approaches towards TB patients, specifically MDR-TB.

ID ATTITUDES
AB Concern about mental health issues and the treatment of mentally disordered offenders attracts considerable public attention. This study aimed to gather the experiences and opinions of people who have experienced admission to a psychiatric ward in order to grasp their reaction to, and understanding of, the legislation behind the involuntary admission of psychiatric patients. A web-based questionnaire survey was conducted with a total of 379 participants, using a cross-sectional, exploratory design. The data were analyzed using a chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test, and a logistic regression analysis. According to the results, many patients were satisfied with their treatment during psychiatric admission; however, only few participants said that they had been given an adequate explanation for their involuntary treatment. Most participants expected qualified assistance after discharge, although the prospect of a regular visit from an official was not entirely supported by the participants. Patient satisfaction was relevant to the discussion of their needs after discharge and in developing a crisis plan during admission. These findings suggest that psychiatric patients accept inpatient treatment as long as they receive an adequate explanation. More qualified care such as relapse prevention would be expected to lead to better satisfaction. For them to welcome regular visits from an official, patients may need more information and discussion.

AB Background
   The obesity epidemic presents a major public health challenge, and a poor diet quality has been identified as one of the most important contributing factors. Whereas a sufficient fruit and vegetable consumption has been associated with several positive health outcomes, the long-term effect on overweight and obesity is unclear. Thus, the aims of this study were to investigate if one year with free school fruit had any effect on weight status 14 years later, and if it affected the birth weight of the participants' children.
   Methods
   In 2001, 10-12-year old Norwegian children, received one year of free school fruit in the intervention study "Fruits and Vegetables Make the Marks" (FVMM) and in 2016, a total of 1081 participants of 2049 eligible responded to a follow-up survey. Multilevel logistic regression was used to investigate if one year of free school fruit was associated with weight status and with birthweight status of the offspring. The analyses were adjusted for gender, educational level, and the offspring analysis also for parents' weight status, and the nested design (child/parent).
   Results
   The odds ratios of being overweight (OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.70, 1.24) or having a child with high or low birth weight (OR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.21, 1.30) in the intervention group compared to the control group were not statistically significant, 14 years after the intervention period.
   Conclusions
   One year of free school fruit did not have an effect on weight status on the participants or birth weight of their offspring, 14 years after the intervention period. Although, results from the present study contribute to fill the knowledge gaps concerning long-term effects of public health efforts on weight status, more follow-up studies with larger samples are warranted.

AB Background: Early diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) and involvement of the public-private partnership are critical to eradicate TB. Patients need to receive proper treatment through the National Tuberculosis Control Programme (NTP). This study describes various predictors for health seeking behaviour of TB patients and health system delay made by the different health care providers.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a public health facility of a rural area in Bangladesh. Newly diagnosed smear positive pulmonary TB (PTB) patients who were >= 15 years of age were sequentially enrolled in this study. The socio-demographic characteristics and proportion of health care utilization by the patients, and health system delay made by the health care providers were calculated. Multivariate analysis was conducted to determine the independent association of the risk factors with the time to seek medical care.
   Results: Two hundred and eighty patients were enrolled in this study. Among them, 73.6% were male and 26.4% were female. A hundred percent of patients primarily sought treatment for their cough, 170 (60.7%) first consulted a non-qualified practitioner while 110 patients (39.3%) first consulted with qualified practitioners about their symptoms. Pharmacy contact was the highest (27.9%) among the non-qualified practitioners, and 58.9% non-qualified practitioners prescribed treatment without any laboratory investigation. The average health system delay was 68.5 days. Multiple logistic regressions revealed a significant difference between uneducated and educated patients (OR 2.33; CI 1.39-3.92), and qualified and non-qualified practitioners (OR 2.34; CI 1.38-3.96) to be independent predictors of health system delay.
   Conclusions: Compared to men, fewer women sought TB treatment. Uneducated patients and questionably qualified practitioners made for a longer delay in detecting TB. Increasing public health awareness and improving health seeking behavior of females and uneducated patients, and greater participation of the qualified practitioners in the NTP are highly recommended.

AB Background: Viral hepatitis is an important public health issue in sub-Saharan Africa. Due to rising mortality from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and limited implementation of screening and treatment programmes, it has been characterised as a neglected tropical disease. Synthesis of the existing evidence on the epidemiology of viral hepatitis B, C and D in Malawi is required to inform policy and identify research gaps.
   Methods: We searched Pubmed, EMBASE and Scopus for studies reporting the epidemiology of viral hepatitis B, C and D in Malawi from 1990 to 2018. Articles reporting prevalence estimates were included provided they described details of participant selection, inclusion criteria and laboratory methods (detection of HBsAg, anti-HCV or anti-HDV antibody, HCV antigen or HCV RNA or HDV RNA). We assessed study quality using a prevalence assessment tool. Where appropriate, a pooled prevalence was calculated using a DerSimonian Laird random effects model.
   Results: Searches identified 199 studies, 95 full text articles were reviewed and 19 articles were included. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroprevalence was assessed in 14 general population cohorts. The pooled prevalence among adults was 8.1% (95% CI 6.1, 10.3). In 3 studies where HBsAg was stratified by HIV status, no effect of HIV on HBsAg prevalence was observed (OR 1.2 (95% CI: 0.8, 1.6, p = 0.80)). In a single study of HIV/HBV infected individuals, anti-hepatitis D antibody (anti-HDV) prevalence was low (1.5%). HCV antibody prevalence (anti-HCV) ranged from 0.7 to 18.0% among 12 cohorts in general populations. Among three studies which used PCR to confirm current infection, the pooled rate of HCV RNA confirmation among anti-HCV positive individuals was only 7.3% (95% CI: 0.0, 24.3).
   Conclusions: Hepatitis B is highly prevalent in Malawi. There is a paucity of epidemiological data from rural areas where 85% of the population reside, and the Northern region. Priority research needs include large-scale representative community studies of HBV, HDV and HCV seroprevalence, assessment of children following introduction of the HBV vaccine in 2002, prevalence estimates of viral hepatitis among individuals with cirrhosis and HCC and data on HCV prevalence using PCR confirmation, to support a viral hepatitis strategy for Malawi.

AB Background: High prevalence of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) among adolescents is a serious public health concern. Although many factors are attributed to adolescents' risk of STI infections, the association between out of school adolescents' employment status and STIs has not been thoroughly explored in Uganda, yet many adolescents are known to be employed. Consequently, the extent to which adolescents' employment status may be a risk factor for unprotected sex and STIs among female adolescents is unclear. This study examines the association between female out of school adolescents' employment status and STI status using the Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS) data for 2016.
   Methods: Both descriptive and multilevel binary logistic regressions were used to analyse the data. The descriptive statistics provided an overview of the association between the two main variables while the multilevel binary logistic estimated the relationship between employment status and STI status, while controlling for other fixed factors and community random factors.
   Results: Compared to female adolescents who were not employed or not working, the odds of reporting positive STIs were significantly higher for female adolescents who were working but received no pay (1.801(95% CI=1.105-2.936), were self-employed in agriculture (1.502 (95% CI=1.003-2.250) and who did manual jobs (2.258(95% CI=1.429-3.568) whether skilled or not. Likewise, female adolescents who had two or more lifetime sexual partners (11.679 (95% CI=1.254-2.248) had significantly higher odds of reporting STIs than those who had only one lifetime sexual partner.
   Conclusion: Out of school female adolescents who are employed in various types of low wage employments are at greater risk of exposure to STIs than their counterparts who do not work in Uganda. Instead of being a protective factor against the risk of STIs, their employment may expose them to risky sexual behaviour and STIs, given the vulnerabilities female adolescents who have dropped out of school tend to report. Therefore, the provision of decent employment opportunities for these females may provide an avenue for instructional scaffolding to build the life skills and empower these females so that they are better able to reduce their exposure to STIs.

AB Background: Hip fractures are a major worldwide public health problem and includes two main types of fractures: the intracapsular (cervical) and the extracapsular (trochanteric and subtrochanteric) fractures. The aim of this study on patients with trochanteric and subtrochanteric hip fractures was to describe the epidemiology, treatment and outcome in terms of mortality within the context of a large register study.
   Methods: A descriptive epidemiological register study including patients registered in the national Swedish Fracture Register from January 2014 to December 2016. Inclusion criteria were all primary surgically treated traumatic non-pathological trochanteric and subtrochanteric femoral fractures in patients aged 18years and above. Individual patient data (age, gender, injury location, injury cause, fracture type, treatment and timing of surgery) were retrieved from the register database. Mortality data was obtained via linkage to the Swedish Death Register.
   Results: A total of 10,548 consecutive patients were identified and included in the study. The mean (SD) age for all patients was 82 +/- 11years and the majority of the patients were females (69%). Most of the fractures were caused by a fall at the same level (83%) at the patients' accommodation (75%). Fractures were classified using the AO/OTA classification as 31-A1 in 29%, as 31-A2 in 49% and as 31-A3 in 22% of the cases. The most commonly used implant was a short antegrade intramedullary nail (42%), followed by a plate with sliding hip screw (37%). With increasing fracture complexity, the proportion of intramedullary nails was increasing, and also the use of long versus short nails. The majority of the patients were operated within 36h (90%). There was a higher mortality at 30 days and 1 year for males, and for all those who were delayed to surgery >36h.
   Conclusion: Safety measures to prevent fall at elderly patient's accommodation might be a way to reduce the number of trochanteric and subtrochanteric hip fractures. Surgery as soon as possible without delay should be considered to reduce the mortality rate. The selection of surgical methods depends on the fracture complexity.

AB Background: The European Health Examination Survey in Luxembourg (EHES-LUX) is a population based survey performed from 2013 to 2015 with the aim to establish baseline information on the general health status of the Luxembourg population aged 25 to 64 years. The paper introduces the study design, recruitment method and representativeness of the sample, and summarizes the sociodemographic characteristics of participants and the prevalence of major health outcomes.
   Methods: EHES-LUX is based on a random sample representative of the population of Luxembourg based on gender, age and district of residence. The sample size of the study was determined to provide accurate prevalence estimates for major chronic conditions. During two visits, data were collected from participants through a questionnaire (personal data, health status and health care), medical examinations (anthropometric measures, electrocardiogram and spirometry) and biological analysis (blood, urine and hair). Means and frequencies were used to describe the general characteristics of the population and a one-way ANOVA to test the representativeness of the sample and the comparability of participants and non-participants.
   Results: A total of 1529 individuals participated in this study (participation rate of 24.1%). Differences between participants and non-participants based on gender, age and district of residence were corrected by sampling weights. The mean age (+/- SD) of participants was 44.9 (+/- 10.1) years, of which 52.8% were women. Based on clinical measurements, nearly 20% of participants were obese and more than one in three participants were overweight. From measurements (respectively from self-report), 22.0% (respectively 12.2%) were hypertensive, 49.3% (respectively 22.5%) had hypercholesterolemia, 3.5% (respectively 3.7%) had diabetes and 7.6% (respectively 6.0%) had depressive symptoms.
   Conclusions: This nationwide epidemiological study on the general health status of Luxembourg residents provides updated prevalence estimates on a range of major health conditions. This information can be used by health authorities to evaluate policies and public health initiatives. At European level, prevalence data obtained by this study following the EHES-Reference Committee (EHES-RC) recommendations, will be comparable between European countries participating in this program.

AB Background: With the proliferation of social casino games (SCGs) online, which offer the opportunity to gamble without monetary gains and losses, comes a growing concern regarding the effects of these unregulated games on public health, particularly among adolescents. However, given the limited research pertaining to SCG use, little is currently known about the manner in which adolescents engage with this new gambling medium. The present study aims to identify the factors that characterize adolescent social casino gamers, and to determine whether these factors differ by SCG type. Moreover, the study examines the extent to which social casino gaming is associated with monetary gambling and problem gambling in this cohort.
   Method: Data were obtained from students in Grades 9 to 12 (n = 10,035) residing in the Canadian provinces of Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador. Participants completed the Youth Gambling Survey (YGS), which is a supplementary instrument administered alongside the Canadian Student Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey (CSTADS). Logistic regression was used to assess the factors associated with SCG play.
   Results: Overall, 12.4% of respondents reported having participated in SCGs in the past three months. Compared to adolescents who did not report playing SCGs, SCG players were typically more likely to participate in monetary gambling activities, and were more prevalently classified as problem gamblers of low-to-moderate severity or high severity. Although profiles of SCG players differed across SCG game types, factors significantly associated with the playing of SCGs were gender, weekly spending money, having friends and parents who gamble, and screen time. It was also shown that current smokers were significantly more likely to participate in simulated slots online relative to adolescents who did not play SCGs.
   Conclusion: Significant associations exist between SCG play, monetary gambling, and problem gambling among adolescents. Gambling intervention efforts directed at this population should aim to identify personal and environmental factors associated with social casino gaming, and should be tailored to different types of SCGs.

AB Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a major public health concern worldwide affecting up to one in five women at reproductive age. It is associated with biochemical and hormonal disturbances as well as adverse cosmetic, reproductive, metabolic, and psychological consequences, resulting in worsened quality of life. The aim of the present study is evaluating the quality of life and determining its degrading factors among Iranian women suffering from this syndrome.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 200 PCOS women in Hamadan, Iran. In order to measure quality of life we used the Persian version of Health-related Quality of Life Questionnaire for PCOS (PCOSQ). Descriptive statistics was used to explore the data. In addition linear regression analysis was performed to assess factors affecting health-related quality of life in this population.
   Results: The mean score for quality of life domains (from the greatest to the least serious concern) were: infertility (3.43 +/- 1.63), emotions (3.55 +/- 1.17), menstrual problems (3.77 +/- 1.36), body hair (3.80 +/- 2.05) and weight (4.32 +/- 1.80), respectively. The higher score represents better function. However, multivariate analysis revealed that hirsutism had the strongest impact on the patients' quality of life (p < 0.001) followed by infertility (p = 0.038) and menstrual irregularity (p = 0.003).
   Conclusion: The findings showed that impairment of quality of life was associated with PCOS related conditions such as hirsutism, infertility and menstrual problems.

AB Antibiotic resistance is a major public health problem requiring the early optimization of antibiotic prescriptions. Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time Of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been shown to accurately identify bacteria from positive blood culture. Here, we developed a rapid detection of Escherichia coli resistance to amoxicillin (AMX) and cefotaxime (CTX) from positive blood culture based on MALDI-TOF MS. Potential sparing of broad-spectrum antibiotics was also evaluated. We tested 103 E. coli-positive blood cultures. Blood cultures were subculture 1-hour in antibiotic-free rich liquid media before further incubation with and without AMX for 2.5 h or CTX for 2 h. Protein extracts associated with an internal control were spotted on a MALDI-TOF target and spectra were analyzed with the MBT-ASTRA prototype software (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany). Bacterial growth ratio was calculated from the AUC spectra obtained in the presence and absence of the antibiotic and compared to a threshold which classified E. coli as susceptible or resistant. Results were interpreted with MICs determined using agar dilution method as reference technique. MBT-ASTRA recognized 95% and 84% of the AMX-and CTX-susceptible isolates, respectively. Overall, quantitative analysis of mass spectra allows susceptibility testing within 4 hours after the positivity of blood culture with E. coll. At the first report of positive blood culture, MALDI-TOF MS would then provide the prescribers with the bacterial identification and the susceptibility to AMX and CTX, thus limiting the use of broad-spectrum compounds.

AB Introduction
   Childhood obesity is currently a serious public health challenge in developing countries. Therefore, an accurate assessment of adiposity is required. The objective of this study was to validate BIA prediction equations for the assessment of total body water and adiposity or percentage of body fat for the first time in Senegalese school-aged children.
   Methods
   One-hundred-fifty-one (151) pupils who were 8-11 years old were randomly selected from four public schools in Dakar. The body composition measured by deuterium dilution method (DDM) was used as the reference method and compared to that predicted by BIA using a multi-frequency analyser. Stepwise backward multiple linear regression was performed to calculate TBW and %BF in a subsample, which were then validated in the rest of the sample. The Bland and Altman approach was used to assess the agreement between the two methods (bias and limits of agreement).
   Results
   FFM was higher in boys (24.6 +/- 6.9 kg) compared to girls (21.2 +/- 3.3 kg; P<0.001), and FM was lower in boys: 3.7 kg [0.9-26.4] compared to girls: 4.5 kg [1.7-22.7]. Overall, 11.3% of children presented excess adiposity (%BF >25% in boys, and >30% in girls) and 2.0% were obese according to WHO cut points for obesity (BMI z-score >+2.0). The equations developed were as follows: TBW = 0.376(Height(2)/Z(50))-0.470 (sex) +0.076(weight) +0.065 (height)-2.28.
   %BF = -1.10(height(2)/Z(50)) +3.14(sex)+1.57(weight)-4.347. These specific equations showed good precision and a low and non-significant mean bias (0.11 kg, P = 0.279; and 0.19 kg, P = 0.764) for TBW and %BF, respectively.
   Conclusion
   The newly developed equations can be used as an accurate and alternative screening tool for the assessment of obesity among children in various settings.

TI Anemia and associated factors among adolescent girls living in Aw-Barre
   refugee camp, Somali regional state, Southeast Ethiopia
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID DEFICIENCY; IRON
AB Background
   Adolescent girls have a higher risk of anemia due to an increased requirement, low intake of hematopoietic nutrients and low intake of a nutrient that enhance absorption of these hematopoietic nutrients. Adolescent girls living in refugee camps are more vulnerable to anemia. The study aimed to determine the prevalence of anemia and associated factors among adolescent girls aged 10-19 years in Aw-Barre refugee camp, Somalia regional state, Southeast Ethiopia.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional study design was employed. Study participants were recruited using a simple random sampling technique. A structured questionnaire was used to collect the data. Hemoglobin level was tested using HemoCueHb 301 from 10 mu l finger prick blood samples. Adolescents with a hemoglobin level of <12.5gm/dl after altitude adjustment were classified as anemic. Data were entered using Epi Info version 7.0 and analyzed using SPSS version 20.0. Binary logistic regression was used to explore the association of independent variables with anemia. Variables having P-value <= 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
   Results
   Four hundred thirty-seven adolescent girls participated in the study with a response rate of 95.83%. The prevalence of anemia was 22% (95% CI (17.6, 26.1)). Late adolescents were 2 times more likely to have anemia as compared to early adolescents (AOR: 1.95, 95% CI (1.09, 3.47). Those who stayed >= 8 years in the camp were 3 times more likely to develop anemia (AOR: 2.92, 95% CI (1.14, 7.50)). Those who ate heme iron food sources less than one time per month were 11 times more likely to develop anemia compared to those who ate more than twice within a week (AOR: 11.42, 95% CI (3.42, 38.18)).
   Conclusions
   The prevalence of anemia among adolescent girls was a moderate public health problem. Education and awareness on adolescent nutrition with special attention of late adolescents and duration in the refugee camps is warranted. Moreover, promoting the intake of foods rich in heme iron is suggested.

TI Costs and cost-effectiveness of LEEP versus cryotherapy for treating
   cervical dysplasia among HIV-positive women in Johannesburg, South
   Africa
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID INFECTION; RISK
AB Background
   Cervical cancer incidence is significant in countries, such as South Africa, with high burdens of both HIV and human papillomavirus (HPV). Cervical cancer is largely preventable if dysplasia is diagnosed and treated early, but there is debate regarding the best approaches for screening and treatment, especially for low-resource settings. Currently South Africa provides Pap smears followed by colposcopic biopsy and LEEP if needed in its public health facilities. We estimated the costs and cost-effectiveness of two approaches for treating cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher (CIN2+) among HIV-infected women, most of whom were taking antiretroviral treatment, at a public HIV treatment facility in Johannesburg, South Africa.
   Methods
   Method effectiveness was derived from an intention-to-treat analysis of data gathered in a clinical trial completed previously at the study facility. In the trial, women who were diagnosed with CIN2+ and eligible for cryotherapy were randomized to cryotherapy or LEEP. If women were CIN2+ at six months as determined via Pap smear and colposcopic biopsy, all women-regardless of their original treatment assignment-received LEEP. "Cure" was then defined as the absence of disease at 12 months based on Pap smear and colposcopic biopsy. Health service costs were estimated using micro-costing between June 2013 and April 2014. Capital costs were annualized using a discount rate of 3%. Two different service volume scenarios were considered, and results from an as-treated analysis were considered in sensitivity analysis.
   Results
   In total, 166 women with CIN2+ were enrolled (86 had LEEP; 80 had cryotherapy). At 12 months, cumulative loss to follow-up was 12.8% (11/86) for the LEEP group and 13.8% (11/80) for cryotherapy. Based on the unadjusted intention-to-treat analysis conducted for this economic evaluation, there was no significant difference in efficacy. At 12 months, 83.8% (95% CI 73.8-91.1) of women with CIN2+ at baseline and randomized to cryotherapy were free of CIN2+ disease. In contrast, 76.7% (95% CI 66.4-85.2) of women assigned to LEEP were free from disease. On average, women initially treated with cryotherapy were less costly per patient randomized at US $ 118.00 (113.91-122.10), and per case "cured" at US$ 140.90 (136.01-145.79). Women in the LEEP group cost US$ 162.56 (157.90-167.22) per patient randomized and US$ 205.59 (199.70-211.49) per case cured. In the as-treated analysis, which was based on trial data, LEEP was more efficacious than cryotherapy; however, the difference was not significant. Cryotherapy remained more cost-effective than LEEP in all sensitivity and scenario analyses.
   Conclusions
   For this cost-effectiveness analysis, using an intention-to-treat approach and taking into consideration uncertainty in the clinical and cost outcomes, a strategy involving cryotherapy plus LEEP if needed at six months was dominant to LEEP plus LEEP again at six months if needed for retreatment. However, compared to other studies comparing LEEP and cryotherapy, the efficacy results were low in both treatment groups-possibly due to the HIV-positivity of the participants. Further research is needed, but at present choosing the "right" treatment option may be less important than ensuring access to treatment and providing careful monitoring of treatment outcomes.

AB BackgroundUnderstanding the perceived importance of Patient-Centered Care (PCC) among Palestinian doctors and how the provider and other clinical characteristics may impact their views on PCC is essential to determine the extent to which PCC can be implemented. This study investigates the provision of PCC among hospital doctors in a developing and unstable country, namely, Palestine.MethodsThis descriptive, cross-sectional research employed self-report survey among 369 Palestinian doctors working in hospitals in 2016. Respondents completed the Provider-Patient Relationship Questionnaire (PPRQ) and were asked to rate the importance of 16 PCC subjects in a context-free manner. Then they scored the existence of eight contextual attributes in their workplace.ResultsAlthough 71.4% of the participants got training in communication, only 45% of the participants knew about PCC. 48.8% of doctors considered the exchange of information with patients most important PCC component. Clustering identified three groups of doctors: 32.4% of doctors reported good perceptions of PCC, 47.5% moderate; and 20.1% poor. Older, married, and specialist doctors and those familiar with PCC are more likely classified in the good cluster. Results revealed a significant difference between doctors' views based on their gender, experience, marital status, previous knowledge about PCC, and type of hospital in favor of males, experienced, married, familiar with PCC, and doctors in private hospital respectively. The level of job interest, nurses' cooperation, the tendency of patients to hide information, and doctor's friendly style were positively related with more perceived importance of PCC.ConclusionWe identified benchmark doctors who perceive the high relative importance of PCC. Our results highlighted knowledge gaps and training weaknesses among doctors in public and private hospitals in respect to their views on PCC. Decision makers may invest in the determined contextual predictors to enhance attitudes towards PCC. This work doesn't address patients' views on PCC.

DE Rotavirus associated diarrhoea; Children; Rotavirus vaccine; Kenya
ID GASTROENTERITIS; PROTECTION; INFANTS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MORTALITY
AB Background: Rotavirus infection is the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis globally in children under 5 years of age and is responsible for approximately 5% of all child deaths yearly. Rotavirus vaccination is considered an effective public health strategy to prevent infection and reduce the severity of disease. Multi-centre country trials on rotavirus vaccines demonstrated efficacy rates of more than 85% in developed countries but only about 65% in developing nations. Rotavirus vaccination was introduced into the Kenya Expanded Programme on Immunization (KEPI) in 2014. The objective of our study was to determine the prevalence of rotavirus infection, severity of acute diarrhoea and to determine the rotavirus vaccination status among children aged 3-24months presenting with acute diarrhoea at Kenyatta National Hospital after introduction of rotavirus vaccine in Kenya.
   Methods: A total of 365 children aged 3-24months presenting with acute diarrhoea at KNH were recruited from August 2016 to April 2017. Data on rotavirus vaccination status, nutritional status, feeding practices and sociodemographic characteristics were obtained and a full clinical evaluation of the patients was done. Severity of the gastroenteritis was assessed using the 20 point Vesikari Clinical Severity Scoring System. The children who were admitted were followed up for 7days using hospital ward registers. Comorbid conditions were established from patient's clinical records and physical examination. Stool specimens from study participants were tested for rotavirus using a commercially available enzyme linked immunosorbent immunoassay kit- ProSpecT Rotavirus Microplate Assay.
   Results: Majority of the children (96.7%) had received rotavirus vaccinations. The overall rotavirus prevalence was 14.5% and was higher among 17-24months at 19.5%. The prevalence somewhat differed by gender, nutritional status, exclusive breastfeeding status, age and education level of mother/caregiver. Overall, a half of the children had severe acute diarrhoea and there were some differences in severity by child/mother characteristics.
   Conclusion: There is still burden of rotavirus diarrhoea after introduction of rotavirus vaccine and the prevalence varies by child characteristics.

AB Background: Childhood obesity continues to be a significant public health issue worldwide. Recent national studies in Spain show a stable picture. However, prevalence and trends differ by socio-economic status, age, and region. We present the trend in childhood excess weight prevalence, aged 8-15years, in Andalusia from 2011-2012 to 2015-2016 by socio-economic status.
   Methods: Using the cross-sectional Andalusian Health Surveys, objective anthropometric measures were taken for a representative sample of 8-15year olds in Andalusia in 2011-2012 and 2015-2016. Prevalence and changes in prevalence of excess weight (overweight plus obesity) were calculated, using both the WHO and IOTF criteria, overall and for sex, age and three different indicators of SES.
   Results: Overall prevalence of excess weight decreased from 42.0% in 2011-2012 to 35.4% in 2015-2016. Overweight decreased from 28.2 to 24.2% and obesity from 13.8 to 11.2%. In 2011-2012 the prevalence of excess weight in boys was 46.0%and 37.9% in girls; in 2015-2016 the difference became significant with 41% of boys with excess weight compared with 30% in girls.
   Conclusions: Childhood excess weight prevalence in Andalusia has decreased slightly between 2011-2012 and 2015-2016. Notably, a decrease in obesity prevalence in girls aged 8-15years was recorded. In 2011-2012 a social gradient for excess weight prevalence across three SES indicators was observed: in 2015-2016 this gradient disappeared. Nonetheless, prevalence remains too high.

AB Background: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) are global health burden. Medication adherence in people living with HIV (PLWH) is a key element in reducing morbidity and mortality. Quantitative and qualitative assessment of research activity helps identify research gaps as well as efforts implemented to improve adherence behaviors in PLWH. The aim of the current study was to assess and analyze literature on HIV/AIDS-related medication adherence using bibliometric methods.
   Methods: SciVerse Scopus was used to accomplish the purpose of the current study. The study period included all times up to 2017. The analysis was restricted to documents published in academic journals.
   Results: Search strategy retrieved 3021 documents with an average of 32.5 citations per document, an h-index of 136, and an average of 4.4 authors per documents. The volume of literature on HIV/AIDS-related medication adherence constituted 1.3% of the overall HIV/AIDS literature. There was a significant (p < 0.01; r = 0.9) correlation between the growth of publications in AIDS-related stigma and medication adherence. The regions of America (567.9) had the highest research output per one million infected people (567.9) followed by the European region (314.3), Western Pacific Region (70.7), Eastern Mediterranean region (31.4), South East Asia (34.0), and Africa (19.3). Geographical distribution of publications showed an active contribution of certain countries in the Southern and Eastern region of Sub-Saharan Africa. Harvard University (8.4%; n = 254) was the most active institution. The top cited documents focused on the impact of adherence on disease outcome and the impact of text messages on improving medication adherence.
   Conclusion: Research on medication adherence in PLWH showed regional variations. International research collaboration with high burden regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa needs to be strengthened to achieve the global target of ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030.

ID PHASE; CONSTITUENTS
AB Background: Scientific and professional development opportunities for early career scientists in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are limited and not consistent. There is a disproportionately low number of biomedical and clinical researchers in LMIC's relative to their high burden of disease, a disparity that is aggravated by emigration of up to 70% of scientists from their countries of birth for education and employment elsewhere. To help address this need, a novel University-accredited, immersive fellowship program was established by a large public-academic-private network. We sought to describe the program and summarize progress and lessons learned over its first 7-years.
   Methods: Hallmarks of the program are a structured learning curriculum and bespoke research activities tailored to the needs of each fellow. Research projects expose the scientists to state-of-the-art methodologies and leading experts in their fields while also ensuring that learnings are implementable within their home infrastructure. Fellows run seminars on drug discovery and development that reinforce themes of scientific leadership and teamwork together with practical modules on addressing healthcare challenges within their local systems. Industry mentors achieve mutual learning to better understand healthcare needs in traditionally underserved settings. We evaluated the impact of the program through an online survey of participants and by assessing research output.
   Results: More than 140 scientists and clinicians from 25 countries participated over the 7-year period. Evaluation revealed strong evidence of knowledge and skills transfer, and beneficial self-reported impact on fellow's research output and career trajectories. Examples of program impact included completion of post-graduate qualifications; establishment and implementation of good laboratory- and clinical-practice mechanisms; and becoming lead investigators in local programs. There was a high retention of fellows in their home countries (> 75%) and an enduring professional network among the fellows and their mentors.
   Conclusions: Our experience demonstrates an example for how multi-sectoral partners can contribute to scientific and professional development of researchers in LMICs and supports the idea that capacity-building efforts should be tailored to the specific needs of beneficiaries to be maximally effective. Lessons learned may be applied to the design and conduct of other programs to strengthen science ecosystems in LMICs.

AB Background: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is common and its prevalence has increased steadily over several decades. Monitoring of rates and severity of CKD across populations is critical for policy development and resource planning. Administrative health data alone has insufficient sensitivity for this purpose, therefore utilizing population level laboratory data and novel methodology is required for population-based surveillance. The aims of this study include a) develop the Manitoba CKD Cohort, b) estimate CKD prevalence, c) identify individuals at high risk of progression to kidney failure and d) determine rates of comorbid health conditions.
   Methods: Administrative health and laboratory data from April 1996 to March 2012 were linked from the data repository at the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy. Prevalence was estimated using three methods: a) all CKD cases in administrative and laboratory databases; b) all CKD cases captured only through the laboratory data; c) and the capture-recapture method. Patients were stratified by risk by estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) and albuminuria based on Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. For comorbid health conditions, the counts were modelled using a Generalized Linear Model (GLM).
   Results: The Manitoba CKD Cohort consisted of 55,876 people with CKD. Of these, 18,342 were identified using administrative health data, 27,393 with laboratory data, and 10,141 people were identified in both databases. The CKD prevalence was 5.6% using the standard definition, 10.6% using only people captured by the laboratory data and 10.6% using the capture-recapture method. Of the identified cases, 46% were at high risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), 41% were at low risk and 13% were not classified, due to unavailable laboratory data. High risk cases had a higher burden of comorbid conditions.
   Conclusion: This study reports a novel methodology for population based CKD surveillance utilizing a combination of administrative health and laboratory data. High rates of CKD at risk of progression to ESKD have been identified with this approach. Given the high rates of comorbidity and associated healthcare costs, these data can be used to develop a targeted and comprehensive public health surveillance strategy that encompass a range of interrelated chronic diseases.

TI Medication administration error and contributing factors among pediatric
   inpatient in public hospitals of Tigray, northern Ethiopia
SO BMC PEDIATRICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Medication administration error; Pediatrics; Inpatient; Tigray; Ethiopia
ID EVENTS
AB Background: Medication administration error is a medication error that occurs while administering a medication to a patient. A variety of factors make pediatrics more susceptible to medication errors and its consequences. In low-income countries, like Ethiopia, there is no sufficient evidence regarding medication administration error among pediatrics. The aim of this study is, therefore, to determine the magnitude and factors associated with medication administration error among pediatric population.
   Methods: A prospective observational based cross sectional study design was conducted from January to April 2017. Data collection was done using pre-tested structured questionnaire and blind observation checklist to health professionals in charge of administering selected medications. A total of 1282 medication administrations were obtained using single population proportion formula from patients in the selected public hospitals and the samples were selected using multistage sampling technique. Multivariable logistic regression using odds ratio and 95% confidence interval was used to determine the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. Variables with p-value < 0.05 were considered as independent factors for medication administration error.
   Result: A total of 1251 medication administrations were observed from 1251 patients. The occurrence of medication administration error was 62.7% with 95% CI (59.6%, 65.0%), wrong dose being the most common type of medication administration error with an occurrence rate of 53.7%. Medications administered for pediatric patients less than 1 month age, administered by bachelor degree holder health professionals, prepared in facilities without medication preparation room, prepared in facilities without medication administration guide and administer for patients who have two or more prescribed medications were more likely to have medication administration error than their counterparts with AOR (95% CI) of 7.54(2.20-25.86), 1.52 (1.07-2.17), 13.45 (8.59-21.06), 4.11 (2.89-5.85), and 2.42 (1.62-3.61), respectively.
   Conclusion: This study has revealed that there is high occurrence of medication administration error among pediatric inpatients in public hospitals of Tigray, Northern Ethiopia.. Age of patients, educational level of medication administrators, availability of the medication preparation room and guide, and the number of medications given per single patient were statistically significant factors associated with occurrence of medication administration error.

AB Background
   The HIV-1 epidemic in Ethiopia has been shown to be dominated by two phylogenetically distinct subtype C clades, the Ethiopian (C'-ET) and East African (C-EA) clades, however, little is known about the temporal dynamics of the HIV epidemic with respect to subtypes and distinct clades. Moreover, there is only limited information concerning transmission of HIV-1 drug resistance (TDR) in the country.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional survey was conducted among young antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive individuals recently diagnosed with HIV infection, in Gondar, Ethiopia, 2011-2013 using the WHO recommended threshold survey. A total of 84 study participants with a median age of 22 years were enrolled. HIV-1 genotyping was performed and investigated for drug resistance in 67 individuals. Phylogenetic analyses were performed on all available HIV sequences obtained from Gondar (n = 301) which were used to define subtype C clades, temporal trends and local transmission clusters. Dating of transmission clusters was performed using BEAST.
   Result
   Four of 67 individuals (6.0%) carried a HIV drug resistance mutation strain, all associated with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). Strains of the C-EA Glade were most prevalent as we found no evidence of temporal changes during this time period. However, strains of the C-SA Glade, prevalent in Southern Africa, have been introduced in Ethiopia, and became more abundant during the study period. The oldest Gondar transmission clusters dated back to 1980 (C-EA), 1983 (C-SA) and 1990 (C'-ET) indicating the presence of strains of different subtype C clades at about the same time point in Gondar. Moreover, some of the larger clusters dated back to the 1980s but transmissions within clusters have been ongoing up till end of the study period. Besides being associated with more sequences and larger clusters, the C-EA Glade sequences were also associated with clustering of HIVDR sequences. One cluster was associated with the G190A mutation and showed onward transmissions at high rate.
   Conclusion
   TDR was detected in 6.0% of the sequenced samples and confirmed pervious reports that the two subtype C clades, C-EA and C'-ET, are common in Ethiopia. Moreover, the findings indicated an increased diversity in the epidemic as well as differences in transmission clusters sizes of the different clades and association with resistance mutations. These findings provide epidemiological insights not directly available using standard surveillance and may inform the adjustment of public health strategies in HIV prevention in Ethiopia.

   EFFICACY; ADULTS
AB Objective
   The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a preclinical oral prophylaxis education program by examining the effectiveness of the teaching module on changes to the students' attitudes towards their individual hygiene behaviors with interdental brushes (IDBs).
   Methods
   As being part of a new didactic program on oral interproximal prophylaxis, all preclinical third-year students (n = 96) enrolled in the 2014/15 academic year received theoretical, preclinical, and clinical lessons on interproximal prophylaxis. The evaluation of educational outcomes was linked to observed changes in students' hygiene behaviors using interdental brushes. Knowledge, skills, attitudes, satisfaction, competence and performance were also explored. The evaluation interviews were recorded at each recall, i.e., 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 1 year after baseline.
   Results
   Motivation to use IDBs is clearly related to the perception of the effectiveness of the brushes and the perception of bleeding reduction. At one week, 89.6% of subjects reported using IDBs. Individual use decreased significantly from one week to one month (-26%, p =0.006) while a non-significant upward trend occurred between one month and three months. Among students reporting usage of IDBs at 1 year (20.8%), only 2.0% used IDBs daily. Most students would recommend IDBs to other people at the beginning (69.8%). However, this share dropped to 50% at 3 months. IDB-users prescribed more than non-users.
   Discussion and public health implications
   The implementation of a module on interdental hygiene practices in the oral health program is strongly recommended. However, corrective measures should be considered regarding the organization and frequency of recall periods in order to improve the performance of the curriculum.

AB Introduction
   Intestinal parasitic infections are a major public health problem in inter-tropical areas. The aim of our study was to describe the situation in Mahajanga, Madagascar with a particular focus on two protozoa, Dientamoeba fragilis and Blastocystis sp.
   Methods
   This was a prospective study from February to June 2015. Stool samples from symptomatic hospitalized patients and asymptomatic volunteers were submitted to microscopy and molecular assays in order to detect parasites.
   Results
   A wide panel of intestinal parasites were identified among the 265 included subjects, protozoa being the most prevalent with 72.8% whereas the prevalence of helminths and microsporidia was of 7.9% and 4.5%, respectively. Blastocystis sp. was the most prevalent protozoa (64.5% of the entire cohort) followed by various amoebas (35.5%) and flagellates (27,5%). We only detected subtypes 1, 2 and 3 of Blastocystis sp. Among the patients positive for D. fragilis (9.4%), 23 carried genotype 1 and 1 genotype 2. For the first time, we detected in 4 human stools the DNA of a recently described protozoon, Simplicimonas similis. Interestingly, subjects living in urban areas harbored significantly more different parasitic species than subjects living in rural areas with a correlation between sanitary level of neighborhood and protozoan infection. However, there was no difference in prevalence of digestive symptoms between parasite-free and parasite-infected subjects, except for Giardia intestinalis which had more symptomatic carriers.
   Discussion
   Our study reveals a high overall parasite prevalence, similar to what had been found in 2003 in the same city and to other prevalence studies conducted in Africa. The poor access of the population to sanitary infrastructures may explain this result. Data from our study provide valuable key for sanitation programs and prevention of fecal-related infectious diseases.

AB Introduction
   Vector Borne Diseases (VBDs) have a major impact on public health and socio-economic development. Inter-sectoral collaboration was recommended as one of the key elements of Integrated Vector Management (IVM), however limited evidence measures the effect and contribution of intersectoral approaches including but not only IVM. This systematic review aims to assess the existing evidence on all forms of inter-sectoral collaboration in VBD control and prevention, identify any gaps and develop a framework from a global perspective.
   Methods
   Articles were identified through a search of PUBMED, Science of Direct, Web of Knowledge, Google Scholar and WHO archives using key words and excluded duplications (n = 2,034). The exclusion of non-VBDs control and prevention interventions resulted in 194 eligible titles/abstract/keywords for full text assessment. Further exclusion of non-peer reviewed articles, non-declaration of ethical clearance, reviews and expert opinion articles resulted in 50 articles finally being included for analysis with the extraction of data on outcome, factor/s influencing the effectiveness, indicators of collaboration and sustainability.
   Results
   Of the 50 articles included in the analysis, 19 articles were categorized as of moderate-strong quality. All articles compared pre- and post-intervention outcomes against disease or vector variables. Three papers included outcome variables on intersectoral collaboration and participation indicator. However, no paper undertook component analysis by different sectors or different activities. Only one paper compared cost data for community-intersectoral intervention for IRS and traditional "vertical" IRS. Six factors were identified as influencing the effectiveness of inter-sectoral collaboration. Five of six factors are the main ones, namely the approach (37/47), resources (34/47), relationships (33/47), management (29/47) and shared vision (20/47) factors. A conceptual framework has been developed based on this review.
   Conclusion
   This review shows the importance of inter-sectoral collaboration to reduce VBDs or vector densities. However, very few studies measured how much inter-sectoral collaboration contributes to the impact. Further high-quality studies using inter-sectoral collaboration indicators are recommended to be undertaken.

TI Commercialization of obstetric and neonatal care in the Democratic
   Republic of the Congo: A study of the variability in user fees in
   Lubumbashi, 2014

AB Objective
   In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, insufficient state financing of the health system produced weak progress toward targets of Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5. In Lubumbashi, almost all women pay out-of-pocket for obstetric and neonatal care. As no standard pricing system has been implemented, there is great variation in payments related to childbirth between health facilities and even within the same facility. This work investigates the determinants of this variation.
   Methods
   We conducted a cross-sectional study including women from admission through discharge at 92 maternity wards in Lubumbashi in March 2014. The women's payments were collected and validated by triangulating interviews of new mothers and nurses with document review. We studied payments related to delivery from the perspective of women delivering. The total was the sum of the payments linked to seeking and accessing care and transport of the woman and companion. The determinants were assessed by multilevel regression.
   Results
   Median payments for delivery varied by type: for an uncomplicated vaginal delivery, US$45 (range, US$17-260); for a complicated vaginal delivery US$60 (US$16-304); and for a Cesarean section, US$338 (US$163-782). Vaginal delivery was more expensive at health centers than in general referral hospitals or polyclinics. Cesarean sections done in corporate polyclinics and hospitals were more expensive than those done in the general referral hospitals. Referral of delivering women, use of more highly trained personnel, and a longer stay in the maternity unit contributed to higher expenses. A vaginal delivery in the private sector was more cost-effective than in the public sector.
   Conclusion
   To guarantee universal coverage of high-quality care, we suggest that the government and funders in DRC support health insurance and risk pool initiatives, and introduce and institutionalize free mother and infant care.

TI Identification of hospital cost drivers using sparse group lasso
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH-CARE; REGRESSION; SELECTION; SURGERY; MODELS
AB Public hospital spending consumes a large share of government expenditure in many countries. The large cost variability observed between hospitals and also between patients in the same hospital has fueled the belief that consumption of a significant portion of this funding may result in no clinical benefit to patients, thus representing waste. Accurate identification of the main hospital cost drivers and relating them quantitatively to the observed cost variability is a necessary step towards identifying and reducing waste. This study identifies prime cost drivers in a typical, mid-sized Australian hospital and classifies them as sources of cost variability that are either warranted or not warranted-and therefore contributing to waste. An essential step is dimension reduction using Principal Component Analysis to preprocess the data by separating out the low value 'noise' from otherwise valuable information. Crucially, the study then adjusts for possible co-linearity of different cost drivers by the use of the sparse group lasso technique. This ensures reliability of the findings and represents a novel and powerful approach to analysing hospital costs. Our statistical model included 32 potential cost predictors with a sample size of over 50,000 hospital admissions. The proportion of cost variability potentially not clinically warranted was estimated at 33.7%. Given the financial footprint involved, once the findings are extrapolated nationwide, this estimation has far-reaching significance for health funding policy.

AB Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have dramatically changed the landscape of hepatitis C treatment and prevention. The World Health Organization has called for the elimination of hepatitis C as a public health threat by 2030. However, the discrepancy in DAA prices across low-, middle- and high-income countries is considerable, ranging from less than US$ 100 to approximately US$ 40,000 per course, thus representing a major barrier for the scale-up of treatment and elimination. This article describes DAA pricing and pathways to accessing affordable treatment, providing case studies from Australia, Egypt and Portugal. Pathways to accessing DAAs include developing comprehensive viral hepatitis plans to facilitate price negotiations, voluntary and compulsory licenses, patent opposition, joint procurement, and personal importation schemes. While multiple factors influence the price of DAAs, a key driver is a country's capacity and willingness to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies. If negotiations do not lead to a reasonable price, governments have the option to utilise flexibilities outlined in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. Affordable access to DAAs is underpinned by collaboration between government, civil society, global organisations and pharmaceutical companies to ensure that all patients can access treatment. Promoting these pathways is critical for influencing policy, improving access to affordable DAAs and achieving hepatitis C elimination.

TI Associations of lack of voluntary private insurance and out-of-pocket
   expenditures with health inequalities. Evidence from an international
   longitudinal survey in countries with universal health coverage
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CARE-SYSTEMS; PREVALENCE; SHARE
AB Objectives
   In countries with universal health coverage (UHC), national public health insurances cover 70% of health expenditures on average, but health care user fees and out-of-pocket expenditures have been neglected in empirical patient-centered health inequality research. This study is the first to investigate how health care-related factors are associated with health status among middle-aged and elderly people-vulnerable groups for the burden of illness-in countries with UHC.
   Design
   Longitudinal observational cohort study.
   Setting
   Population-based cohort Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) in twelve countries with UHC.
   Participants
   Non-institutionalized people aged 50 and older (n = 29,260). Two subsamples were also used: participants without global activity limitation at baseline (n = 16,879) and participants without depression at baseline (n = 21,178).
   Main outcome measures
   Risk of death, risk of global activity limitations, and risk of depression. We used mixed-effects Cox proportional hazards regressions to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for all-cause mortality, physical limitations, and depression.
   Results
   Having a voluntary private insurance to cover health expenses not included in the public health care system (44.1% of the total sample) was a protective factor for all outcomes (HR <= 0.91), controlling for a large range of socio-economic variables. On the contrary, having out-of-pocket expenditures (62.4%) was a risk factor (HR >= 1.12).
   Conclusions
   UHC systems are not free from health inequalities: there is a potential effect of lack of voluntary private insurance and out-of-pocket expenditures on mortality and health. Health care-related factors should be at focus in future researches designed to understand and address health inequalities. Reducing out-of-pocket expenditures and developing voluntary private insurance may protect against premature illness and death.

AB Objective
   Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) is a pressing human right issue and public health concern. We conducted a systematic review of quantitative and qualitative studies published in the past decade on CSA in India to examine the distribution of the prevalence estimates for both genders, to improve understanding of the determinants and consequences of CSA and identify gaps in the current state of research.
   Methods
   For this systematic review, we searched electronic literature databases (PubMed, POPLINE, and PsycINFO) for articles published in English on Child Sexual Abuse in India between January 1, 2006 and January 1, 2016 using 55 search terms. Data were extracted from published articles only.
   Findings
   Fifty-one studies met inclusion criteria for the review. The review indicates that prevalence rates of CSA is high among both boys and girls in India. Due to heterogeneity of study designs and lack of standardised assessments, reported prevalence estimates varied greatly among both genders in different studies. There is a need to conduct representative studies using a validated instrument to obtain valid epidemiological estimates. Commercial sex workers, men who have sex with men, and women with psychiatric disorders were at higher risks for sexual abuse during childhood. In addition, the synthesis of qualitative data across studies included in the review suggests that exposure and perpetration of CSA is a multifaceted phenomenon grounded in the interplay between individual, family, community, and societal factors. The review indicates poor physical, behavioural, social, and mental health outcomes of CSA in India. We conclude with a research agenda calling for quantitative and qualitative studies to explore the determinants and perpetration of child sexual abuse in India from an ecological lens. This research agenda may be necessary to inform the development of a culturally tailored primary prevention and treatment strategy for CSA victims in India.

TI Contribution of social factors to maternal deaths in urban India: Use of
   care pathway and delay models
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MORTALITY; INTERVENTIONS; CHANDIGARH; CHILD
AB This paper uses care pathway and delay models to better understand the possible social reasons for maternal deaths in a city with good public and private health infrastructure. The findings can inform programmes to reduce maternal mortality. During 2007-15, 136 maternal deaths were reported in Chandigarh, India. Using World Health Organisation's verbal autopsy questionnaire, interviews were conducted with primary caregivers of 68 (50%) of the 136 deceased women, as majority of the families had returned to their native places. We used process-tracing techniques to construct the care pathways and identify delays, and explored open-ended responses using thematic analysis. The mean age of the deceased women was 27 years, 51% resided in slums, 32% were primigravida, 25% had their deliveries assisted by traditional birth attendants, and 23% had Caesarean section. Eight percent died at home, and 54% died in tertiary level facilities. Post-partum haemorrhage (26.5%), and complications of puerperium (25%) and labour/delivery (14.7%) were the reported medical causes. Male child preference and norms for home delivery were identified as the distal socio-cultural causes. Individual and family level factors included: shame on multiple pregnancies; fear of discrimination from providers; past successful deliveries at home leading to overconfidence and not seeking institutional care; and lack of awareness about family planning, antenatal care, and danger signs of pregnancy. Healthcare system factors were: non-availability of senior doctors at the time of consultation in the emergency that delayed initiation of immediate treatment, and lack of availability of life-saving equipment due to patient load. Empirical evidence was found on social causes of maternal deaths, which could have been prevented by appropriate actions at individual, family, societal, institutional and policy levels. This study identified potential preventable causes of primarily social origin, which could help in taking actionable steps at several levels to further reduce maternal deaths in India.

TI Bat rabies in Washington State: Temporal-spatial trends and risk factors
   for zoonotic transmission (2000-2017)

DT Article

AB Background
   Rabies is a zoonotic viral disease that can affect all mammals. In the United States, the majority of human rabies cases are caused by bats, which are the only known reservoirs for rabies virus (RABV) in Washington State. We sought to characterize bat RABV epidemiology in Washington among bats submitted by the public for RABV testing.
   Methods
   We examined temporal and spatial trends in RABV positivity (% positive) for taxonomically identified bats submitted to diagnostic laboratories during 2006-2017. For a subset of Myotis species, we evaluated sensitivity and predictive value positive (PPV) of morphological identification keys, using mitochondrial markers (cytochrome b) as a reference. For bats tested during 2000-2016, we analyzed RABV positivity by circumstances of encounters with humans, cats, and dogs.
   Results
   During 2006-2017, RABV positivity for all bat species was 6.0% (176/2,928). Among species with >= 100 submissions, RABV positivity was 2.0%-11.7% and highest among big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus). An increasing trend in annual positivity was significant only for big brown bats (P = 0.02), and was circumstantially linked to a geographic cluster. Sensitivity and PPV of morphological identification keys was high for M. evotis but varied for M. lucifugus, M. californicus, M. yumanensis, and M. septentrionalis. A positive RABV result was significantly associated with nonsynanthropic species, abnormal behavior, abnormal hiding, injury, biting, found in a body of water, found alive, found outdoors, and caught by a dog.
   Conclusion
   Monitoring passive RABV surveillance trends enables public health authorities to perform more accurate risk assessments. Differences in temporal and spatial trends in RABV positivity by bat species indicate the importance of collecting taxonomic data, although morphological identification can be unreliable for certain Myotis species. Current public health practices for RABV exposures should be maintained as RABV infection in bats can never be excluded without diagnostic testing.

TI Sports participation in sport clubs, gyms or public spaces: How users of
   different sports settings differ in their motivations, goals, and sports
   frequency
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SELF-DETERMINATION; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; EXERCISE; BEHAVIOR; INTEGRATION;
   HEALTHISM; ADULTS; NEEDS
AB Background
   To develop targeted policy strategies to increase sports participation, more insight is needed into the behavioural patterns and preferences of users of different club-organized (i.e., sports clubs) and non-club organized (i.e., gyms, health centres or swimming pools) or informal sports settings such as public spaces. This study investigates 1) how users of different settings differ regarding self-determined motivations and goals, and sociodemographic and sports-related characteristics, and 2) how the association of motivations and goals with sports participation may differ between users of different sports settings.
   Methods
   Data were collected through online surveys among Dutch adults aged 18-80 years (N = 910). Ordinal regression analyses were used to investigate the effects of sports settings, the level of self-determined motivations and goals, and interaction effects of motivations and goals with different sports settings, on sports frequency.
   Results
   Users of different sports settings differed in their personal characteristics, motivations and goals. In general, controlled motivations were negatively associated with sports frequency (B = -0.46). However, among club members, extrinsic goals related to image (B = 0.44), as well as intrinsic goals related to skill development (B = 0.40) and social affiliation (B = 0.47) had significant positive associations with sports frequency. Health-related goals significantly increased sports frequency among users of informal settings, such as public spaces.
   Conclusion
   The association of motivational variables with sports participation differs between settings. This implies that sports frequency is higher when participants engage in settings that better fit their motivations and goals. Because of the growing importance of informal and flexible settings and health goals, professionals in the sports and health domains should take into account the motivations, goals and needs of different target groups who (want to) use unorganized, informal sports settings including public spaces.

AB Background: There is growing evidence of the public health benefits of promoting cycling. The ways that the built environment and perceived social norms independently influence cycling participation is well established. However, whether these factors interact to influence cycling participation has not been examined. Such research is important because understanding the effect of multiple socio-ecological factors and the interactions between them is needed to guide the development of interventions and strategies to increase cycling participation. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the interactive effects of the built environment and perceived social norms on transport and recreational cycling.
   Methods: Data was collected using a self-administered online questionnaire from 228 office workers in Metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Measures used in previous research were employed to assess self-reported transport and recreation cycling in the last week, perceptions of neighbourhood built environment, perceived social norms towards cycling, and objective land-use mix, residential density and street connectivity of the suburbs in which participants lived and work. Multiple binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore the interactive effects of the built environment and perceived social norms on transport and recreation cycling. All interactive effects were considered significant at p < 0.10.
   Results: There was a significant interactive effect between the workplace built environment and perceived group norm on transport cycling (p = 0.06). There were no other significant interactive effects observed between components of the built environment and perceived social norms on transport or recreational cycling.
   Conclusions: The interactive effect found in this study provides some evidence that the workplace built environment interacts with perceived group norms to influence cycling for transport. Positive perceptions of the workplace built environment, such as showers and secure bike racks, can somewhat compensate for the negative influence of when cycling is considered less of a norm among, family, friend or colleagues. However, the findings of this study did not support that the neighbourhood built environment and perceived social norms interact to influence cycling for recreation or transport. These findings contribute to the knowledge of how multiple factors may reciprocate to influence individual's decision to cycle. More research into the interactive effects of socioecological factors is warranted.

AB The ongoing transmission of Mycobacterium (M.) leprae reflected in a very slow decline in leprosy incidence, forces us to be innovative and conduct cutting-edge research. Single dose rifampicin (SDR) as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for contacts of leprosy patients, reduces their risk to develop leprosy by 60%. This is a promising new preventive measure that can be integrated into routine leprosy control programmes, as is being demonstrated in the Leprosy Post-Exposure Programme that is currently ongoing in eight countries.
   The limited (60%) effectiveness of SDR is likely due to the fact that some contacts have a preclinical infection beyond the early stages for which SDR is not sufficient to prevent the development of clinical signs and symptoms of leprosy. An enhanced regimen, more potent against a higher load of leprosy bacteria, would increase the effectiveness of this preventive measure significantly.
   The Netherlands Leprosy Relief (NLR) is developing a multi-country study aiming to show that breaking the chain of transmission of M. leprae is possible, evidenced by a dramatic reduction in incidence. In this study the assessment of the effectiveness of an enhanced prophylactic regimen for leprosy is an important component. To define the so called PEP++ regimen for this intervention study, NLR convened an Expert Meeting that was attended by clinical leprologists, public health experts, pharmacologists, dermatologists and microbiologists.
   The Expert Meeting advised on combinations of available drugs, with known efficacy against leprosy, as well as on the duration of the intake, aiming at a risk reduction of 80-90%. To come to a conclusion the Expert Meeting considered the bactericidal, sterilising and bacteriostatic activity of the potential drugs. The criteria used to determine an optimal enhanced regimen were: effectiveness, safety, acceptability, availability, affordability, feasibility and not inducing drug resistance.
   The Expert Meeting concluded that the enhanced regimen for the PEP++ study should comprise three standard doses of rifampicin 600 mg (weight adjusted when given to children) plus moxifloxacin 400 mg given at fourweekly intervals. For children and for adults with contraindications for moxifloxacin, moxifloxacin should be replaced by clarithromycin 300 mg (weight adjusted).

AB The number of patients presenting for care at gender clinics is increasing, yet the proportion of adults in the general population who want gender-affirming medical treatment remains essentially unknown. We measured the wish for cross-sex hormones or gender-affirming surgery, as well as other aspects of gender incongruence, among the general adult population of Stockholm County, Sweden. A population-representative sample of 50,157 Stockholm County residents ages 22 and older comprise the Stockholm Public Health Cohort. They were enrolled in 2002, 2006, and 2010 and followed-up in roughly 4-year intervals, with questions on health, lifestyle and social characteristics. In 2014, participants received the item "I would like hormones or surgery to be more like someone of a different sex." Two additional items concerned other aspects of gender incongruence: "I feel like someone of a different sex, and I would like to live as or be treated as someone of a different sex." Each item had four answer options ("Not at all correct," "Somewhat or occasionally correct," "Quite correct," and "Absolutely correct"). For each item, any of the three affirmative answer choices were considered as some level of agreement. Calibration weights were used to estimate population-representative rates with 95% confidence intervals. The desire for cross-sex hormones or surgery was reported by 0.5% (95% CI, 0.4%-0.7%) of participants. Feeling like someone of a different sex was reported by 2.3% (95% CI, 2.1%-2.6%). Wanting to live as or be treated as a person of another sex was reported by 2.8% (95% CI, 2.4%-3.1%). These findings greatly exceed estimates of the number of patients receiving gender-affirming medical care. Clinicians must be prepared to recognize and care for patients experiencing discomfort due to gender incongruence and those who would like gender-affirming medical treatment.

AB Background: Inappropriate use of medications, particularly among minority older adults with co-morbidity, remains a major public health concern. The American Geriatrics Society (AGS) reports that Potentially Inappropriate Medication (PIM) continues to be prescribed for older adults, despite evidence of poor outcomes. The main objective of this study was to examine the prevalence of PIM use among underserved non-institutionalized hypertensive older African-American adults. Furthermore, this study examines potential correlations between PIM use and the number and type of chronic conditions.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study is comprised of a convenience sample of 193 hypertensive non-institutionalized African-American adults, aged 65 years and older recruited from several senior housing units located in underserved areas of South Los Angeles. The updated 2015 AGS Beers Criteria was used to identify participants using PIMs.
   Results: Almost one out of two participants had inappropriate medication use. While the average number of PIMs taken was 0.87 drugs, the range was from one to seven medications. Almost 23% of PIMs were due to drugs with potential drug-drug interactions. The most common PIM was the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and Central Nervous System (CNS) active agents. Nearly 56% of PIMs potentially increased the risk of falls and fall-associated bone fractures. The use of PIMs was significantly higher among participants who reported a higher number of chronic conditions. Nearly 70% of participants with PIM use reported suffering from chronic pain.
   Conclusions: The major reason for high levels of polypharmacy, PIMs, and drug interactions is that patients suffer from multiple chronic conditions. But it may not be possible or necessary to treat all chronic conditions. Therefore, the goals of care should be explicitly reviewed with the patient in order to determine which of the many chronic conditions has the greatest impact on the life goals and/or functional priorities of the patient. Those drugs that have a limited impact on the patient's functional priorities and that may cause harmful drug-drug interactions can be reduced or eliminated, while the remaining medications can focus on the most important functional priorities of the patient.

   STIGMA; SCHIZOPHRENIA; DISORDERS; DEPRESSION; FATALISM; BELIEFS; CULTURE
AB Background: Stigma towards people with mental health problems (PMHP) is known to have substantial negative impacts on their lives. More in-depth exploration of the stigma and discrimination experienced by PMHP in low-and middle-income countries is needed. Previous research suggests that negative attitudes towards PMHP are widespread among the Filipino general public. However, no study has investigated PMHP's own experiences of being stigmatised in the Philippines.
   Methods: A qualitative study was conducted on the stigma experienced by PMHP (including people with epilepsy) and its related factors in the Philippines, employing the constructivist grounded theory approach. We analysed data on 39 PMHP collected through interviews with PMHP, their carers, and community health volunteers who know them well.
   Results: The findings highlight the culturally and socio-economically specific contexts, consequences, and impact modifiers of experiences of stigma. Participants emphasised that PMHP face stigma because of the cultural traits such as the perception of mental health problem as a disease of the family and the tendency to be overly optimistic about the severity of the mental health problem and its impact on their life. Further, stigma was experienced under conditions where mental health care was not readily available and people in the local community could not resolve the PMHP's mental health crisis. Stigma experiences reduced social networks and opportunities for PMHP, threatened the economic survival of their entire family, and exacerbated their mental health problems. An individual's reaction to negative experiences can be fatalistic in nature (e.g. believing in it is God's will). This fatalism can help PMHP to remain hopeful. In addition, traditional communal unity alleviated some of the social exclusion associated with stigma.
   Conclusions: The study indicates that existing stigma-reduction strategies might have limitations in their effectiveness across cultural settings. Therefore, we propose context-specific practical implications (e.g. emphasis on environmental factors as a cause of mental health problems, messages to increase understanding not only of the possibility of recovery but also of challenges PMHP face) for the Philippines.

AB Background: Uganda halved its maternal mortality to 343/100,000 live births between 1990 and 2015, but did not meet the Millennium Development Goal 5. Skilled, timely and good quality antenatal (ANC) and delivery care can prevent the majority of maternal/newborn deaths and stillbirths. We examine coverage, equity, sector of provision and content of ANC and delivery care between 1991 and 2011.
   Methods: We conducted a repeated cross-sectional study using four Uganda Demographic and Health Surveys (1995, 2000, 2006 and 2011). Using the most recent live birth and adjusting for survey sampling, we estimated percentage and absolute number of births with ANC (any and 4+ visits), facility delivery, caesarean sections and complete maternal care. We assessed socio-economic differentials in these indicators by wealth, education, urban/ rural residence, and geographic zone on the 1995 and 2011 surveys. We estimated the proportions of ANC and delivery care provided by the public and private (for-profit and not-for-profit) sectors, and compared content of ANC and delivery care between sectors. Statistical significance of differences were evaluated using chi-square tests.
   Results: Coverage with any ANC remained high over the study period (> 90% since 2001) but was of insufficient frequency; < 50% of women who received any ANC reported 4+ visits. Facility-based delivery care increased slowly, reaching 58% in 2011. While significant inequalities in coverage by wealth, education, residence and geographic zone remained, coverage improved for all indicators among the lowest socio-economic groups of women over time. The private sector market share declined over time to 14% of ANC and 25% of delivery care in 2011. Only 10% of women with 4+ ANC visits and 13% of women delivering in facilities received all measured care components.
   Conclusions: The Ugandan health system had to cope with more than 30,000 additional births annually between 1991 and 2011. The majority of women in Uganda accessed ANC, but this contact did not result in care of sufficient frequency, content, and continuum of care (facility delivery). Providers in both sectors require quality improvements. Achieving universal health coverage and maternal/newborn SDGs in Uganda requires prioritising poor, less educated and rural women despite competing priorities for financial and human resources.

DT Article
DE Vaccine; History; Classification; Supply; Price; China
AB Background: Vaccine regulation in China meets World Health Organization standards, but China's vaccine industry and immunization program have some characteristics that differ from other countries. We described the history, classification, supply and prices of vaccines available and used in China, compared with high-and middle-incomes countries to illustrate the development of Chinese vaccine industry and immunization program.
   Methods: Immunization policy documents were obtained from the State Council and the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC). Numbers of doses of vaccines released in China were obtained from the Biologicals Lot Release Program of the National Institutes for Food and Drug Control (NIFDC). Vaccine prices were obtained from Chinese Central Government Procurement (CCGP). International data were collected from US CDC, Public Health England, European CDC, WHO, and UNICEF.
   Results: Between 2007 and 2015, the annual supply of vaccines in China ranged between 666 million and 1,190 million doses, with most doses produced domestically. The government's Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) prevents 12 vaccine preventable diseases (VPD) through routine immunization. China produces vaccines that are in common use globally; however, the number of routinely-prevented diseases is fewer than in high- and middle-income countries. Contract prices for program (EPI) vaccines ranged from 0.1 to 5.7 US dollars per dose - similar to UNICEF prices. Contract prices for private-market vaccines ranged from 2.4 to 102.9 US dollars per dose - often higher than prices for comparable US, European, and UNICEF vaccines.
   Conclusion: China is a well-regulated producer of vaccines, but some vaccines that are important globally are not included in China's EPI system in China. Sustained and coordinated effort will be required to bring Chinese vaccine industry and EPI into an era of global leadership.

AB Background: High rates of suicidal behaviours among Indigenous Australians have been documented. Justice-involved individuals are also at a higher risk for engaging in suicidal behaviours. This study sought to ascertain the prevalence and correlates of suicidal behaviours for 107 Indigenous adult males in custody in Victoria, Australia.
   Methods: Participants undertook a structured interview comprising a psychiatric assessment Information on suicidal behaviours (ideation and attempts), socio-demographics, environmental stressors, negative life events and mental health was obtained.
   Results: A high proportion of Indigenous males in custody experienced lifetime suicidal ideation (63.7%) and over one-half had attempted suicide (54.5%). A smaller, yet significant number of participants experienced ideation over the past 12 months (27.9%). Having a loved one pass away within the past 12 months predicted recent ideation; lifetime ideation and a diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder predicted a lifetime suicide attempt.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of suicidal behaviours among Indigenous people in custody is remarkably high. Correlates of suicidal behaviours for Indigenous people in custody in this study likely manifest in the community, denoting an urgent public health response. Prevention must begin in communities at-risk for suicidal behaviours. The development of low intensity mental health service infrastructure in communities to promote awareness and provide accessible, least restrictive support and treatment is necessary. Correctional institutions must also continue to improve custodial suicide prevention and management initiatives.

TI Understanding intersections of social determinants of maternal

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID INEQUALITIES; DISPARITIES; MORTALITY
AB Objective
   To explore intersections of social determinants of maternal healthcare utilization using the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm which is a machine-learning method used to construct prediction models.
   Methods
   Institutional review board approval for this study was granted from Public Health Service- Ethical Review Board (PHS-ERB) and from the Health Ministry Screening Committee (HMSC) facilitated by Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). IRB review and approval for the current analyses was obtained from University of California, San Diego. Cross-sectional data were collected from women with children aged 0-11 months (n = 5,565) from rural households in 25 districts of Uttar Pradesh, India. Participants were surveyed on maternal healthcare utilization including registration of pregnancy (model-1), receipt of antenatal care (ANC) during pregnancy (model-2), and delivery at health facilities (model -3). Social determinants of health including wealth, social group, literacy, religion, and early age at marriage were captured during the survey. The Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm was used to explore intersections of social determinants of healthcare utilization.
   Results
   CART analyses highlight the intersections, particularly of wealth and literacy, in maternal healthcare utilization in Uttar Pradesh. Model-1 documents that women who are poorer, illiterate and Muslim are less likely to have their pregnancies registered (71.4% vs. 86.0% in the overall sample). Model-2 documents that poorer, illiterate women had the lowest ANC coverage (37.7% vs 45% in the overall sample). Model-3, developed for deliveries at health facilities, highlighted that illiterate and poor women have the lowest representation among facility deliveries (59.6% vs. 69% in the overall sample).
   Conclusion
   This paper explores the interactions between determinants of maternal healthcare utilization indicators. The findings in this paper highlights that the interaction of wealth and literacy can play a very strong role in accentuating or diminishing healthcare utilization among women. The study also reveals that religion and women's age at marriage also interact with wealth and literacy to create substantial disparities in utilization. The study provides insights into the effect of intersections of determinants, and highlights the importance of using a more nuanced understanding of the impact of co-occurring forms of marginalization to effectively tackle inequities in healthcare utilization.

TI High-fat diet suppresses the positive effect of creatine supplementation
   on skeletal muscle function by reducing protein expression of
   IGF-PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway

AB High-fat (HF) diets in combination with sedentary lifestyle represent one of the major public health concerns predisposing to obesity and diabetes leading to skeletal muscle atrophy, decreased fiber diameter and muscle mass with accumulation of fat tissue resulting in loss of muscle strength. One strategy to overcome the maleficent effects of HF diet is resistance training, a strategy used to improve muscle mass, reverting the negative effects on obesity-related changes in skeletal muscle. Together with resistance training, supplementation with creatine monohydrate (CrM) in the diet has been used to improve muscle mass and strength. Creatine is a non-essential amino acid that is directly involved in the cross-bridge cycle providing a phosphate group to ADP during the initiation of muscle contraction. Besides its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects CrM also upregulates IGF-1 resulting in hyperthophy with an increase in muscle function. However, it is unknown whether CrM supplementation during resistance training would revert the negative effects of high-fat diet on the muscle performance. During 8 weeks we measured muscle performance to climb a 1.1m and 80 degrees ladder with increasing load on trained rats that had received standard diet or high-fat diet, supplemented or not with CrM. We observed that the CrM supplementation up-regulated IGF-1 and phospho-AKT protein levels, suggesting an activation of the IGF1P13K-Akt/PKB-mTOR pathway. Moreover, despite the CrM supplementation, HF diet downregulated several proteins of the IGF1-PI3K-Akt/PKB-mTOR pathway, suggesting that diet lipid content is crucial to maintain or improve muscle function during resistance training.

TI Methodological considerations in clinical outcomes assessment of
   pharmacy-based minor ailments management: A systematic review
SO PLOS ONE

DT Review
ID COMMUNITY PHARMACY; SELF-MEDICATION; SYMPTOMS; QUALITY; SERVICE; IMPACT;
   USAGE; CARE
AB Background
   The accessibility of services within community pharmacies provides an ideal opportunity to manage minor ailments, yet over 1.1 pound billion is spent by the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom (UK) in managing minor ailments in high cost settings. There is a need to review the evidence base around clinical effectiveness of pharmacy- based management of minor ailments since the absence of such may lead to under- utilisation of pharmacy services and non- implementation of available pharmacy service models. This study aimed to systematically review the methodological approaches used to assess clinical outcomes of pharmacy- based management of minor ailments in the research literature.
   Methods
   A systematic review was conducted to identify relevant literature using the following databases: Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, IPA, CRD, CDSR, and Google Scholar from publication year 2000 onwards. Studies were included if they evaluated clinical outcomes of pharmacybased management of any minor ailments, with or without a comparator setting such as Emergency Departments (EDs) or general practices. Screening and selection of titles, abstracts and full texts followed by data extraction and quality assessment (QA) was conducted. Paired researchers, from the team, reviewed papers using a protocol based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta- Analysis Protocols (PRISMAP). QA was undertaken using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP). Reporting was conducted in accordance with PRISMA checklist and statements.
   Results
   A total of 19 studies were included. The majority of studies were observational, conducted in community pharmacies, and did not use a comparator participant group nor a comparator setting. Interventions included counselling, medicines supply and provision of advice on the management of minor ailments. One study used the randomised controlled trial (RCT) design with majority of the study utilising observational design. A range of clinical outcomes including symptom severity, pattern, resolution, and quality of life were reported. Methods used for the assessment of clinical outcomes were, overall, poorly reported. This included a lack of information on the development and validation of the data collection tools and the timing of baseline and follow-up data collection. Adverse clinical outcomes data were collected by only seven studies.
   Conclusions
   Currently, there are methodological limitations in the studies that have sought to assess clinical outcomes of pharmacy-based management of minor ailments. Such lack of high quality evidence may contribute to failings to shift care from high cost settings, such as EDs and general practices. Generation of high quality evidence is likely to influence public choices when seeking care for minor ailments. There is scope for development of a core outcomes set specific to minor ailments management and development of a validated methodology for measuring such outcomes in a research study.

   EXPENDITURES; POPULATION; MORTALITY; TIMES; VARIABLES; PAYMENTS
AB This paper uses two nationally representative sets of medical claims data from medical assistance and universal public health insurance systems to examine how medical assistance system assignment affects short-term inpatient health care provision. In Japan, the medical assistance system, which is part of a public assistance system, provides medical care services for its beneficiaries without imposing any financial burdens, such as copayments or advance premium payments. These circumstances can lead to inpatient costs, as physicians may provide more treatments because there is a financial incentive. Because the assignment of public assistance in Japan is not random but is subject to means testing by the local government, I employ the instrumental variable model to control the potential correlation. I find that medical expenditure is significantly higher for medical assistance patients than for universal public health insurance patients, with an arc elasticity of approximately 0.20. This elasticity is slightly greater than that found for inpatient care in the randomized RAND Health Insurance Experiment and recent empirical studies on low-income populations. In addition, the elasticities for patients who receive medication, treatment and surgery are greater.

AB Background: Antimicrobial resistance is a public-health threat and antimicrobial consumption is the main contributor. The ten-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV10) was introduced into the Icelandic vaccination program in 2011.
   The aim was to estimate the vaccine impact of PHiD-CV10 on outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions in children.
   Methods: Eleven Icelandic birth-cohorts (2005-2015) were followed from birth until three years of age or to the end of the study period (December 31, 2016). Birth-cohorts were grouped as vaccine non-eligible (VNEC, 2005-2010) or vaccine eligible (VEC, 2011-2015). Data on primary care visits for respiratory infections and antimicrobial prescriptions were extracted from two national registers. Using national identification numbers, prescriptions were linked to physician visits if filled within three days of the visit. Incidence rates and incidence rate ratios between VNEC and VEC were calculated. An Andersen-Gill model was used to model the individual level data, accounting for repeated events and censoring. Vaccine impact was calculated as (1 - Hazard Ratio) x 100%.
   Results: Included were 53,510 children who contributed 151,992 person-years of follow-up and filled 231,660 antimicrobial prescriptions. The incidence rate was significantly lower in the VEC compared to the VNEC, 144.5 and 157.2 prescriptions per 100 person-years respectively (IRR 0.92, 95%CI 0.91-0.93). Children in VEC were more likely to have filled zero (IRR 1.16 (95%CI 1.10-1.23) and 1-4 (IRR 1.08 95%CI 1.06-1.11) prescriptions compared to children in VNEC. The vaccine impact of PHiD-CV10 against all-cause antimicrobial prescriptions was 5.8% (95%CI 1.6-9.8%).When only considering acute otitis media-associated prescriptions, the vaccine impact was 21.8% (95%CI 11.5-30.9%).
   Conclusion: The introduction of PHiD-CV10 lead to reduced antimicrobial use in children, mainly by reducing acute otitis media episodes. This intervention therefore reduces both disease burden and could slow the spread of antimicrobial resistance.

AB Background: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs)-producing Escherichia coli (E. coli) isolates in environment water become progressively a potential threat to public health, while the detailed information about the ESBL-producing E. coli isolates in the rivers and lakes in Northwest China is scarce. In the present study, it was aimed to characterize the ESBL-producing E. coli isolated from the surface waters in Northwest China.
   Results: A total of 2686 E. coli isolates were obtained from eleven rivers and lakes in Northwest China to screen for ESBL producers. Seventy-six (2.8%) isolates were classified as ESBL producers, and phylogenic groups D and A accounted for 59.2% of the ESBL producers. CTX-Ms were the predominant ESBLs genotype, and they were represented by seven bla(CTX-M) subtypes. bla(CTX-M-14) was the most prevalent specific CTX-M gene, followed by bla(CTX-M-9), bla(CTX-M-123), bla(CTX-M-15), bla(CTX-M-27), bla(CTX-M-1) and bla(CTX-M-65). Moreover, 54 of the 76 ESBL producers carried at least one plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) gene, and aac(6')-Ib-cr was predominant. The overall occurrence of virulence factors ranged from 1.3% (eae) to 48.7% (traT). Thirty-seven sequence types (STs) were confirmed among the 76 ESBL producers, and the predominant was ST10, which was represented by 10 isolates; importantly, clone B2-ST131, associated with severe infections in humans and animals, was detected three times.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli from the rivers and lakes in Northwest China was low (2.8%), and the extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) pathotype was the most commonly detected on the basis of the virulence factor profiles. 76.3% of ESBL producers harbored more than one beta-lactamase gene, and bla(CTX-M-14) was the predominant genotype. Notably, one ST131 isolate from Gaogan Canal simultaneously harbored bla(CTX-M-9), bla(CTX-M-15), bla(CTX-M-123), bla(KPC-2), bla(NDM-1), bla(OXA-2) as well as the PMQR genes qnrA, qnrS and aac(6')-Ib-cr.

AB Background: Female sex workers (FSWs) in many settings have restricted access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services. We therefore conducted an implementation study to test a 'diagonal' intervention which combined strengthening of FSW-targeted services (vertical) with making public health facilities more FSW-friendly (horizontal). We piloted it over 18 months and then assessed its performance.
   Methods: Applying a convergent parallel mixed-methods design, we triangulated the results of the analysis of process indicators, semi-structured interviews with policy makers and health managers, structured interviews with health care providers and group discussions with peer outreach workers. We then formulated integrated conclusions on the interventions' feasibility, acceptability by providers, managers and policy makers, and potential sustainability.
   Results: The intervention, as designed, was considered theoretically feasible by all informants, but in practice the expansion of some of the targeted services was hampered by insufficient financial resources, institutional capacity and buy-in from local government and private partners, and could not be fully actualised. In terms of acceptability, there was broad consensus on the need to ensure FSWs have access to SRH services, but not on how this might be achieved. Targeted clinical services were no longer endorsed by national government, which now prefers a strategy of making public services more friendly for key populations. Stakeholders judged that the piloted model was not fully sustainable, nor replicable elsewhere in the country, given its dependency on short-term project-based funding, lack of government endorsement for targeted clinical services, and viewing the provision of community activities as a responsibility of civil society.
   Conclusions: In the current Mozambican context, a 'diagonal' approach to ensure adequate access to sexual and reproductive health care for female sex workers is not fully feasible, acceptable or sustainable, because of insufficient resources and lack of endorsement by national policy makers for the targeted, vertical component.

AB Background: Dental caries is a major public health issue affecting a large proportion of the general population. The disease is associated with behavioural factors and is thus preventable to a high degree. Individuals may need assistance to be able to change their oral health behaviour. There is a lack of such interventions for adults affected by severe caries. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), a form of cognitive behavioural therapy, on oral health behaviour in young adults with poor oral health.
   Methods: The study included a two group parallel randomised controlled trial at general dental clinics, with young adults, 18-25 years of age, >= two manifest proximal dental caries lesions (n = 135); 67 were treated with ACT and 68 with standard disease information only, respectively. Primary outcomes: oral health behaviours (tooth-brushing, flossing, use of toothpicks, and additional fluoride use). The CONSORT principles for RCTs were used, including intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses. The Chi-square, Mann-Whitney, and Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests were applied, including effect sizes.
   Results: The study groups did not differ with regard to oral health behaviour variables at baseline. The intervention group improved all their oral health behaviours significantly over time (effect sizes, 0.26-0.32), while the control group showed improved behaviours on two measures (flossing and additional use of fluoride, effect sizes, 0.22-0.23).
   Conclusions: By testing a psychological intervention on young adults (18-25 years of age) with a high prevalence of caries, we found an immediate positive effect with improved oral health behaviours.

AB Ethiopia's average life expectancy has improved by more than 18 years from 1990 to 2015. This initiated interest to study the gain in life expectancy with respect to age structure and cause of death. Applying a life expectancy decomposition technique on secondary data obtained from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, the study found that the burden of disease in Ethiopia has declined from 626.18 in 1990 to 225.69 in 2015 per 1000 population measured in age-standardized rate of life years lost. The major causes of burden in 1990; namely lower respiratory tract infections, neonatal disorders, diarrheal diseases and neglected tropical diseases at rates of 89.2, 63.2, 61.2, and 42.2 age-standardized years of life lost per 1000 population respectively; have shown a fast decline in 2015. Deaths from neglected tropical disease showed 94.95% reduction, contributing to 5.71(27.30%) years gain in life expectancy followed by lower respiratory tract infection and diarrheal disease contributing about 4.65 years (22.23%) and 1.48 years (7.10%) respectively. On the other hand, about 3.3 (15.73%) years and 6.4 (30.71%) years of increase in life expectancy are achieved through improved longevity in infants and children aged 1-4 years respectively. In conclusion, the study found that reductions in under-five child mortality and decline in burden of major communicable diseases could explain the major gain in life expectancy. However, findings also revealed that the prevalence of non-communicable diseases and injuries are on the rise calling for the need to be addressed by the public health system.

TI A four-stage DEA-based efficiency evaluation of public hospitals in
   China after the implementation of new medical reforms
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB This study applied the non-parametric four-stage data envelopment analysis method (Four-Stage DEA) to measure the relative efficiencies of Chinese public hospitals from 2010 to 2016, and to determine how efficiencies were affected by eight factors. A sample of public hospitals (n = 84) was selected from Chongqing, China, including general hospitals and traditional Chinese medicine hospitals graded level 2 or above. The Four-Stage-DEA method was chosen since it enables the control of the impact of environment factors on efficiency evaluation results. Data on the number of staff, government financial subsidies, the number of beds and fixed assets were used as input whereas the number of out-patients and emergency department patients and visits, the number of discharged patients, medical and health service income and hospital bed utilization rate were chosen as study outputs. As relevant environmental variables, we selected GDP per capita, permanent population, population density, number of hospitals and number of available sickbeds in local medical institutions. The relative efficiencies (i.e. technical, pure technical, scale) of sample hospitals were also calculated to analyze the change between the first stage and fourth stage every year. The study found that Four-Stage-DEA can effectively filter the impact of environmental factors on evaluation results, which sets it apart from other models commonly used in existing studies.

TI Prevalence, incidence, predictors, treatment, and control of
   hypertension among HIV-positive adults on antiretroviral treatment in
   public sector treatment programs in South Africa
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article

   THERAPY; DISEASE; ASSOCIATION; EPIDEMIC; HEART
AB Background
   One of the key risk factors for cardiovascular disease is hypertension. Hypertension, which leads to heart attacks and strokes, already affects one billion people worldwide, making it a global public health issue. Incidence and prevalence of the condition is on the rise in low-and middle-income countries, with the biggest increase in sub-Saharan Africa and South Africa at the forefront. We examined the prevalence, incidence, predictors, treatment, and control of hypertension among HIV-positive patients on ART in a large South African observational cohort.
   Methods
   We conducted a prospective study of ART naive adults initiating ART at a public sector HIV clinic in South Africa between April 2004-2017. Patients with diagnosed hypertension at ART initiation were excluded from the incidence analysis. Log-binomial regression was used to estimate predictors of hypertension at ART initiation, while competing risks regression was used to evaluate the relationship between predictors of incident hypertension, accounting for death as a competing risk.
   Results
   Among 77,696 eligible patients, 22.0% had prevalent hypertension at ART initiation. Of the remaining patients with no hypertension at ART initiation, 8,125 incident hypertension cases were diagnosed over the period of follow-up, corresponding to an incident rate of 5.4 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval (CI): 5.3-5.6). We found patients >= 40 years of age and patients with a body mass index (BMI) >= 25kg/m(2) were at increased risk of both prevalent and incident hypertension. Male patients and those with pre-hypertension at ART initiation had increased hazards of hypertension over the period of follow-up. When assessing the choice of antiretroviral drug in first-line ART, patients initiated on nevirapine were at 27% increased risk of developing hypertension compared to those initiated on efavirenz, while patients who initiated on either zidovudine or stavudine had a 40% increased risk of developing hypertension compared to patients initiated on tenofovir. Patientswith poorer health status at ART initiation (i.e. WHO III/IV stage, low CD4 count, low hemoglobin levels and low BMI) had a decrease risk of prevalent hypertension. We found an inverse relationship in patients with a CD4 count <50 cells/mm(3) at ART initiation who had a 25% increased risk of incident hypertension compared to those with a CD4 count >= 350 cells/mm(3).
   Conclusion
   Over 20% of patients in our cohort had hypertension at ART initiation, and 13% of those with normal blood pressure at ART initiation developed hypertension while on ART. Older patients, males, those on nevirapine, zidovudine or stavudine, and those who are overweight/obese should be targeted for frequent blood pressure monitoring and the identification of other cardiovascular risk factors to encourage lifestyle modifications. Additionally, these groups should be offered pharmaceutical therapy to help prevent myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and kidney disease. Further research is needed to determine the level of access and adherence to pharmaceutical treatment for hypertension in this population. Additionally, an HIV-negative comparison population is needed to assess the association of the HIV virus itself with hypertension.

AB Objectives
   The aims of this study were to investigate (1) whether and (2) the extent to which Taiwanese older adults' leisure time activity (LTA) trajectories mediated the potential association between their sociodemographic factors and their functional disability trajectories.
   Methods
   Longitudinal data from four waves of the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging (TLSA), collected between 1996 and 2007, were used for analysis (N = 3,429). Parallel-process latent growth curve modeling was adopted to evaluate the process by which LTA mediated between sociodemographic factors (age, gender, education, self-rated health, comorbidities, and depression) and the outcome process of functional disabilities.
   Results
   When mediated by baseline level of LTA, five sociodemographic factors-age, gender, education level, self-rated health, and number of comorbidities-had significant and negative mediating effects on baseline or change in functional disability, thus improving disability outcomes. However, four of the sociodemographic factors (age, education level, and number of comorbidities), when mediated through the rate of change in LTA, were found to have significant and positive mediating effects, which increased disability levels. The proportion of effects mediated by the LTA trajectory ranged from 0% to 194%.
   Discussion
   The large proportion of effects mediated through the LTA process underlines the importance of LTA to public health policy and health programs for older adults. The study's findings shed light on how to better target populations of older adults to promote an active lifestyle and achieve more successful aging in late life in Asian countries.

TI "I should have started earlier, but I was not feeling ill!" Perceptions
   of Kalenjin women on antenatal care and its implications on initial
   access and differentials in patterns of antenatal care utilization in
   rural Uasin Gishu County Kenya
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID DETERMINANTS; BOOKING
AB Aim
   The aim of this study was to explore how Kalenjin women in rural Uasing Gishu County in Kenya perceive antenatal care and how their perceptions impede or motivate earlier access and continuous use of antenatal care services.
   Methods
   A study was conducted among 188 pregnant and post-natal mothers seeking care in 23 rural public health facilities. Gestational age at the initial antenatal care booking was established from their medical cards. Further researcher-administered questionnaire with closed and open-ended questions was used. Key informant interviews with traditional birth attendants (n = 6) and maternal and child health nursing officers (n = 6) were also conducted for triangulation. Descriptive statistics were applied using SPSS programme. The interviews of women who gave consent to be audio recorded (n = 52) were transcribed and thematically analysed using MAXQDA program, based on Andersen and Newman's (1973) behavioural model of health services utilization.
   Results
   The mean gestational age at booking initial biomedical care was 23.36 weeks. Only 18 patients (10%) booked before 13 weeks and 45% made four or more visits. The main reasons given for early booking were: illness in index pregnancy (42%) checking the foetus position and monitoring foetus progress (7%). The main reasons given for late booking were: no reason (31%), was not feeling sick (16%), fear or shame due to unexpected pregnancy (13%). Almost half of the respondents (44%) used both biomedical and traditional antenatal care services. Main reasons for visiting traditional care were to: check foetus position and reposition it (63%), collect medicinal herbs (31%), relief discomforts through massage (18%).
   Conclusion
   Early antenatal care booking is meant for women with unpleasant physical signs and symptoms. Later ANC is meant to check foetus position and reposition it to cephalic presentation and monitor its progress and this is only possible if the foetus is large.

AB Background
   Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS are the major public health problems in many parts of the world particularly in resource limited countries like Ethiopia. Although studies have been conducted on the prevalence and associated factors of TB/HIV co-infection in Ethiopia, there is no comprehensive data on the magnitude and risk factors at a national and regional levels. Therefore, this review is aimed to summarize the prevalence of TB/HIV co-infection in Ethiopia using meta-analysis based on a systematic review of published articles & grey literatures.
   Methods
   To conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis, major databases such as Pub Med, Google scholar, CINAHL, Africa Journals Online and Google were systematically searched using search terms. PRISMA guideline was followed in the study. Two authors extracted all necessary data using a standardized data extraction format, and analysis was done using STATA version 11. A Statistical heterogeneity across the studies was evaluated by using Cochran's Q test and I-2 statistic. The pooled effect size was conducted in the form of prevalence and associations were measured using odds ratio. Moreover, the univariate meta regression was performed by considering the sample size to determine potential sources of heterogeneity. The Egger's weighted regression and Begg's rank correlation tests were used to assess potential publication biases.
   Results
   This meta-analysis included 21 studies with a total of 12,980 participants. The pooled prevalence of TB/HIV Co-infection was 25.59% (95% CI (20.89% - 30.29%). A significant association was found between low CD4 counts (OR: 3.53; 95% CI: 1.55, 8.06), advanced WHO stage (OR: 6.81; 95% CI: 3.91, 11.88) and TB/HIV/AIDS Co-infection.
   Conclusion
   This finding revealed that the magnitude of TB/HIV co-infection in Ethiopia is increasing and deserves special attention. Low CD4 count and advanced WHO stage are contributing factors for dual infection. Establishing mechanisms such as Conducting surveillance to determine HIV burden among TB patients and TB burden among HIV patients, and intensifying the three I's (Intensive case finding, INH Preventive Therapy and Infection control) should be routine work of clinicians. Moreover, early screening & treatment should be provided to those patients with low CD4 count and advanced WHO stage.

AB Arboviruses are a major public health problem worldwide and are predominantly present in intertropical areas. Chikungunya, dengue and zika viruses have been implicated in recent epidemics in Asia, America and Africa. In Cameroon, data on these viruses are fragmentary. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of detection of these three viruses in febrile patients in Douala, Cameroon. A cross-sectional and descriptive study was conducted from March to April 2017 at the New-Bell District Hospital in Douala. Blood samples were collected from febrile patients and tested for malaria infections using Rapid Diagnostic test. Plasma harvested was later analyzed for the presence of chikungunya, dengue and zika viruses by a Trioplex real-time RT-PCR at Centre Pasteur of Cameroon. A total of 114 participants were included, of which 63.2% were females, reflecting a sex ratio (female/male) of 1.7. The median age was 26 years, range [0.25-81]. Eight (7%) of the 114 participants were infected with Dengue virus (DENV) among which 5 were identified as serotype 1. No cases of infection by either Zika virus or Chikungunya virus were detected. Three cases of dengue-malaria co-infection (13%) were recorded. No association was found between socio-demographic factors and dengue infection. The phylogenetic analysis of the partial envelope E gene showed that all the five DENV serotype 1 samples belonged to sub-type V, similarly to strains from West African countries, particularly those from Nigeria, Senegal and Cote d'Ivoire. This study showed the circulation of DENV serotype 1 in febrile patients and raises the alarm for the establishment of a sustained surveillance system to detect cases and prevent potential outbreaks in Cameroon. The existence of dengue-malaria co-infections suggests that surveillance of arboviruses should not be limited to febrile, non-malarial cases.

AB Background: High consumption of antibiotics has been identified as an important driver for the increasing antibiotic resistance, considered to be one of the greatest threats to public health globally. Simply informing the public about this consequence is insufficient to induce behavioral change. This study explored beliefs and perceptions among Swedes, with the aim of identifying factors promoting and hindering a judicious approach to antibiotics use. The study focused primarily on the medical use of antibiotics, also considering other aspects connected with antibiotic resistance, such as travelling and food consumption.
   Methods: Data were collected through focus group discussions at the end of 2016. Twenty-three Swedes were recruited using an area-based approach and purposive sampling, aiming for as heterogeneous groups as possible regarding gender (13 women, 10 men), age (range 20-81, mean 38), and education level. Interview transcripts were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. The Health Belief Model was used as a theoretical framework.
   Results: Antibiotic resistance was identified by participants as a health threat with the potential for terrible consequences. The severity of the problem was perceived more strongly than the actual likelihood of being affected by it Metaphors such as climate change were abundantly employed to describe antibiotic resistance as a slowly emerging problem. There was a tension between individual (egoistic) and collective (altruistic) reasons for engaging in judicious behavior. The individual effort needed and antibiotics overprescribing were considered major barriers to such behavior. In their discussions, participants stressed the need for empowerment, achieved through good health communication from authorities and family physicians.
   Conclusions: Knowledge about antibiotic consumption and resistance, as well as values such as altruism and trust in the health care system, has significant influence on both perceptions of individual responsibility and on behavior. This suggests that these factors should be emphasized in health education and health promotion. To instead frame antibiotic resistance as a slowly emerging disaster, risks diminish the public perception of being susceptible to it.

AB Background: Strategies to reduce childhood obesity and improve nutrition include creating school food environments that promote healthy eating. Despite well-documented health benefits of fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption, many U.S. school-aged children, especially low-income youth, fail to meet national dietary guidelines for FV intake. The Cafeteria Assessment for Elementary Schools (CAFES) was developed to quantify physical attributes of elementary school cafeteria environments associated with students' selection and consumption of FV. CAFES procedures require observation of the cafeteria environment where preparation, serving, and eating occur; staff interviews; photography; and scoring.
   Methods: CAFES development included three phases. First, assessment items were identified via a literature review, expert panel review, and pilot testing. Second, reliability testing included calculating inter-item correlations, internal consistency (Kuder-Richardson-21 coefficients), and inter-rater reliability (percent agreement) based on data collected from 50 elementary schools in low-income communities and 3187 National School Lunch Program participants in four U.S. states. At least 43% of each participating school's students qualified for free- or reduced-price meals. Third, FV servings and consumption data, obtained from lunch tray photography, and multi-level modeling were used to assess the predictive validity of CAFES.
   Results: CAFES' 198 items (grouped into 108 questions) capture four environmental scales: room (50 points), table/display (133 points), plate (4 points), and food (11 points). Internal consistency (KR-21) was 0.88 (overall), 0.80 (room), 0.72 (table), 0.83 (plate), and 0.58 (food). Room subscales include ambient environment, appearance, windows, layout/visibility, healthy signage, and kitchen/serving area. Table subscales include furniture, availability, display layout/presentation, serving method, and variety. Inter-rater reliability (percent agreement) of the final CAFES tool was 90%. Predictive validity analyses indicated that the total CAFES and four measurement scale scores were significantly associated with percentage consumed of FV served (p < .05).
   Conclusions: CAFES offers a practical and low-cost measurement tool for school staff, design and public health practitioners, and researchers to identify critical areas for intervention; suggest low- and no-cost intervention strategies; and contribute to guidelines for cafeteria design, food presentation and layout, and operations aimed at promoting healthy eating among elementary school students.

AB Background: Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region in 2013, with serious implications for population health in the region. In 2016, the World Health Organization declared the ZIKV outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern following a cluster of associated neurological disorders and neonatal malformations. In 2017, Zika cases declined, but future incidence in LAC remains uncertain due to gaps in our understanding, considerable variation in surveillance and the lack of a comprehensive collation of data from affected countries.
   Methods: Our analysis combines information on confirmed and suspected Zika cases across LAC countries and a spatio-temporal dynamic transmission model for ZIKV infection to determine key transmission parameters and projected incidence in 90 major cities within 35 countries. Seasonality was determined by spatio-temporal estimates of Aedes aegypti vectorial capacity. We used country and state-level data from 2015 to mid-2017 to infer key model parameters, country-specific disease reporting rates, and the 2018 projected incidence. A 10-fold cross-validation approach was used to validate parameter estimates to out-of-sample epidemic trajectories.
   Results: There was limited transmission in 2015, but in 2016 and 2017 there was sufficient opportunity for wide-spread ZIKV transmission in most cities, resulting in the depletion of susceptible individuals. We predict that the highest number of cases in 2018 would present within some Brazilian States (Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro), Colombia and French Guiana, but the estimated number of cases were no more than a few hundred. Model estimates of the timing of the peak in incidence were correlated (p < 0.05) with the reported peak in incidence. The reporting rate varied across countries, with lower reporting rates for those with only confirmed cases compared to those who reported both confirmed and suspected cases.
   Conclusions: The findings suggest that the ZIKV epidemic is by and large over within LAC, with incidence projected to be low in most cities in 2018. Local low levels of transmission are probable, but the estimated rate of infection suggests that most cities have a population with high levels of herd immunity.

AB Background: Healthy movement behaviours of Canadian children and youth have been found to be suboptimal; this is associated with declines in physical fitness, increases in obesity, and elevated chronic disease risk. Physical literacy is an evolving construct representing foundational domains upon which physically active lifestyles are based. Many sectors and organizations in Canada are embracing physical literacy in their programs, practices, policies, and research; however, the use of inconsistent definitions and conceptualizations of physical literacy had been identified by stakeholders as hindering promotion and advancement efforts.
   Methods: With leadership from ParticipACTION, organizations from the physical activity, public health, sport, physical education, and recreation sectors collaborated to create a physical literacy consensus definition and position statement for use by all Canadian organizations and individuals. The process involved an environmental scan, survey of related evidence, stakeholder consultations, and creation of a Steering Committee. From this background work a consensus statement was drafted, shared with stakeholders, revised, and ratified.
   Results: Canada's Physical Literacy Consensus Statement was launched in June 2015 at the International Physical Literacy Conference in Vancouver, British Columbia. To further promote the Consensus Statement, the Sport for Life Society developed and simultaneously released the "Vancouver Declaration", which contained additional guidance on physical literacy. Both the Consensus Statement and the Declaration endorsed the International Physical Literacy Association's definition of physical literacy, namely "the motivation, confidence, physical competence, knowledge and understanding to value and take responsibility for engagement in physical activities for life".
   Conclusions: Sector partners hope that the Consensus Statement, with its standardized definition, brings greater harmony, synergy, and consistency to physical literacy efforts in Canada and internationally. Going forward, the impact of this initiative on the sector, and the more distal goal of increasing habitual physical activity levels, should be assessed.

AB Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a major etiological agent of various public health issues, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. EV71 causes hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) and is associated with serious neurological disorders in young children. A formalin-inactivated EV71 candidate vaccine (KCDC-HFMDV1-EV71) based on the C4 subgenotype was previously developed and confirmed to be a potential candidate vaccine for prevention of EV71 infection in mice. In this study, an inactivated EV71 vaccine was used for analysis of long-term immunogenicity and efficacy in cynomolgus monkeys, a common nonhuman primate model. The vaccine was immunized three times at 0, 4, and 8 weeks with either 20-mu g doses of EV71 candidate vaccine formulated with aluminum hydroxide gel adjuvant or phosphate-buffered saline as a control. The group immunized with the inactivated EV71 showed significantly increased EV71-specific antibody and serum neutralizing antibody titers at 3 weeks after vaccination and maintained these elevated titers until the end of the experiment (54 weeks after vaccination). The sera from vaccinated cynomolgus monkeys showed a crossreactive neutralizing antibody response to the heterologous subtype of EV71 (B1-4, C1, and C2). These findings suggest that the inactivated EV71 candidate vaccine may be a potential vaccine candidate and valuable tool for the control of HFMD.

AB Geographical variations and influential factors of disease prevalence are crucial information enabling optimal allocation of limited medical resources and prioritization of appropriate treatments for each regional unit. The purpose of this study was to explore the geographical variations and influential factors of cardiometabolic disease prevalence with respect to 230 administrative districts in South Korea. Global Moran's I was calculated to determine whether the standardized prevalences of cardiometabolic diseases (hypertension, stroke, and diabetes mellitus) were spatially clustered. The CART algorithm was then applied to generate decision tree models that could extract the diseases' regional influential factors from among 101 demographic, economic, and public health data variables. Finally, the accuracies of the resulting model-hypertension (67.4%), stroke (62.2%), and diabetes mellitus (56.5%)-were assessed by ten-fold cross-validation. Marriage rate was the main determinant of geographic variation in hypertension and stroke prevalence, which has the possibility that married life could have positive effects in lowering disease risks. Additionally, stress-related variables were extracted as factors positively associated with hypertension and stroke. In the opposite way, the wealth status of a region was found to have an influence on the prevalences of stroke and diabetes mellitus. This study suggested a framework for provision of novel insights into the regional characteristics of diseases and the corresponding influential factors. The results of the study are anticipated to provide valuable information for public health practitioners' cost-effective disease management and to facilitate primary intervention and mitigation efforts in response to regional disease outbreaks.

TI Dietary or supplemental fermentable fiber intake reduces the presence of
   Clostridium XI in mouse intestinal microbiota: The importance of higher

   PROFILES
AB Objectives
   Clostridium difficile infection is a public health concern. C. difficile was found in healthy human intestine as a member of Clostridium XI. Because soluble fermentable fiber ingestion affects intestinal microbiota, we used fiber-containing diets to determine the intestinal microbial condition that could reduce the presence of Clostridium XI.
   Methods
   Newly weaned male mice were assigned to three published diets: Control AIN-93G purified diet with only poorly fermented cellulose; Control plus 5% purified fermentable fiber inulin; Chow with wheat, soybean and corn that provide a mixture of unpurified dietary fibers. Methods were developed to quantify 24-hour fecal microbial load and microbial DNA density. The relative abundance of bacterial genera and the bacterial diversity were determined through 16S rRNA sequence-based fecal microbiota analysis.
   Results
   Mice adjusted food intake to maintain the same energy intake and body weight under these three moderate-fat (7% w:w) diets. Chow-feeding led to higher food intake but also higher 24-h fecal output. Chow-feeding and 1-8 wk ingestion of inulin-supplemented diet increased daily fecal microbial load and density along with lowering the prevalence of Clostridium XI to undetectable. Clostridium XI remained undetectable until 4 weeks after the termination of inulin-supplemented diet. Fermentable fiber intake did not consistently increase probiotic genera such as Bifidobacterium or Lactobacillus. Chow feeding, but not inulin supplementation, increased the bacterial diversity.
   Conclusions
   Increase fecal microbial load/density upon fermentable fiber ingestion is associated with a lower and eventually undetectable presence of Clostridium XI. Higher bacterial diversity or abundance of particular genera is not apparently essential. Future studies are needed to see whether this observation can be translated into the reduction of C. difficile at the species level in at-risk populations.

AB Background: Physical literacy is the foundation of a physically active lifestyle. Sedentary behaviour displays deleterious associations with important health indicators in children. However, the association between sedentary behaviour and physical literacy is unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify the aspects of physical literacy that are associated with key modes of sedentary behaviour among Canadian children participating in the RBC-CAPL Learn to Play study.
   Methods: A total of 8,307 children aged 8.0-12.9 years were included in the present analysis. Physical literacy was assessed using the Canadian Assessment of Physical Literacy, which measures four domains (Physical Competence, Daily Behaviour, Motivation and Confidence, Knowledge and Understanding). Screen-based sedentary behaviours (TV viewing, computer and video game use), non-screen sedentary behaviours (reading, doing homework, sitting and talking to friends, drawing, etc.) and total sedentary behaviour were assessed via self-report questionnaire. Linear regression models were used to determine significant (p<0.05) correlates of each mode of sedentary behaviour.
   Results: In comparison to girls, boys reported more screen time (2.7 +/- 2.0 vs 2.2 +/- 1.8 hours/day, Cohen's d=0.29), and total sedentary behaviour (4.3 +/- 2.6 vs 3.9 +/- 2.4 hours/day, Cohen's d=0.19), but lower non-screen-based sedentary behaviour (1.6 +/- 1.3 vs 1.7 +/- 1.3 hours/day, Cohen's d=0.08) (all p<0.05). Physical Competence (standardized beta's: -0.100 to -0.036, all p<0.05) and Motivation and Confidence (standardized beta's: -0.274 to -0.083, all p<0.05) were negatively associated with all modes of sedentary behaviour in fully adjusted models. Knowledge and Understanding was negatively associated with screen-based modes of sedentary behaviour (standardized beta's: -0.039 to -0.032, all p<0.05), and positively associated with non-screen sedentary behaviour (standardized beta: 0.098, p<0.05). Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run score and log-transformed plank score were negatively associated with all screen-based modes of sedentary behaviour, while the Canadian Agility and Movement Skill Assessment score was negatively associated with all modes of sedentary behaviour other than TV viewing (all p<0.05).
   Conclusions: These results highlight differences in the ways that screen and non-screen sedentary behaviours relate to physical literacy. Public health interventions should continue to target screen-based sedentary behaviours, given their potentially harmful associations with important aspects of physical literacy.

AB Background
   Despite the substantial attention to primary care (PC), few studies have addressed the relationship between patients' experience with PC and their health status in low- and middle-income countries. This study aimed to (1) test the association between overall patient-centered PC experience (OPCE) and self-rated health (SRH) and (2) identify specific features of patient-centered PC associated with better SRH (i.e., excellent or very good SRH) in 6 Latin American and Caribbean countries.
   Methods and findings
   We conducted a secondary analysis of a 2013 public opinion cross-sectional survey on perceptions and experiences with healthcare systems in Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Jamaica, Mexico, and Panama; the data were nationally representative for urban populations. We analyzed 9 features of patient-centered PC. We calculated OPCE score as the arithmetic mean of the PC features. OPCE score ranged from 0 to 1, where 0 meant that the participant did not have any of the 9 patient-centered PC experiences, while 1 meant that he/she reported having all these experiences. After testing for interaction on the additive scale, we analyzed countries pooled for aim 1, with an interaction term for Mexico, and each country separately for aim 2. We used multiple Poisson regression models double-weighted by survey and inverse probability weights to deal with the survey design and missing data. The study included 6,100 participants. The percentage of participants with excellent or very good SRH ranged from 29.5% in Mexico to 52.4% in Jamaica. OPCE was associated with reporting excellent or very good SRH in all countries: adjusting for socio-demographic and health covariates, patients with an OPCE score of 1 in Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Jamaica, and Panama were more likely to report excellent or very good SRH than those with a score of 0 (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] 1.61, 95% CI 1.37-1.90, p < 0.001); in Mexico, this association was even stronger (aPR 4.27, 95% CI 2.34-7.81, p < 0.001). The specific features of patient-centered PC associated with better SRH differed by country. The perception that PC providers solve most health problems was associated with excellent or very good SRH in Colombia (aPR 1.38, 95% CI 1.01-1.91, p = 0.046) and Jamaica (aPR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02-1.43, p = 0.030). Having a provider who knows relevant medical history was positively associated with better SRH in Mexico (aPR 1.47, 95% CI 1.03-2.12, p = 0.036) but was negatively associated with better SRH in Brazil (aPR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56-0.89, p = 0.003). Finally, easy contact with PC facility (Mexico: aPR 1.35, 95% CI 1.04-1.74, p = 0.023), coordination of care (Mexico: aPR 1.53, 95% CI 1.19-1.98, p = 0.001), and opportunity to ask questions (Brazil: aPR 1.42, 95% CI 1.11-1.83, p = 0.006) were each associated with better SRH. The main study limitation consists in the analysis being of cross-sectional data, which does not allow making causal inferences or identifying the direction of the association between the variables.
   Conclusions
   Overall, a higher OPCE score was associated with better SRH in these 6 Latin American and Caribbean countries; associations between specific characteristics of patient-centered PC and SRH differed by country. The findings underscore the importance of high-quality, patient-centered PC as a path to improved population health.

TI Organophosphate exposures during pregnancy and child neurodevelopment:
   Recommendations for essential policy reforms
SO PLOS MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID PRENATAL EXPOSURE; PESTICIDE EXPOSURE; MALATHION; COHORT
AB Widespread use of organophosphate (OP) pesticides to control insects has resulted in ubiquitous human exposures.
   High exposures to OP pesticides are responsible for poisonings and deaths, particularly in developing countries.
   Compelling evidence indicates that prenatal exposure at low levels is putting children at risk for cognitive and behavioral deficits and for neurodevelopmental disorders.
   To protect children worldwide, we recommend the following:
   Governments phase out chlorpyrifos and other OP pesticides, monitor watersheds and other sources of human exposures, promote use of integrated pest management (IPM) through incentives and training in agroecology, and implement mandatory surveillance of pesticide-related illness.
   Health professions implement curricula on the hazards from OP pesticides in nursing and medical schools and in continuing medical education courses and educate their patients and the public about these hazards.
   Agricultural entities accelerate the development of nontoxic approaches to pest control through IPM and ensure the safety of workers through training and provision of protective equipment when toxic chemicals are to be used.

TI Retention in HIV care during the 3 years following release from
   incarceration: A cohort study
SO PLOS MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article

   PUBLIC-HEALTH; ALL-CAUSE; IMPACT; ENGAGEMENT; PEOPLE; RISK
AB Background
   Sustained retention in HIV care (RIC) and viral suppression (VS) are central to US national HIV prevention strategies, but have not been comprehensively assessed in criminal justice (CJ) populations with known health disparities. The purpose of this study is to identify predictors of RIC and VS following release from prison or jail.
   Methods and findings
   This is a retrospective cohort study of all adult people living with HIV (PLWH) incarcerated in Connecticut, US, during the period January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2011, and observed through December 31, 2014 (n = 1,094). Most cohort participants were unmarried (83.7%) men (77.0%) who were black or Hispanic (78.1%) and acquired HIV from injection drug use (72.6%). Prison-based pharmacy and custody databases were linked with community HIV surveillance monitoring and case management databases. Post-release RIC declined steadily over 3 years of follow-up (67.2% retained for year 1, 51.3% retained for years 1-2, and 42.5% retained for years 1-3). Compared with individuals who were not re-incarcerated, individuals who were re-incarcerated were more likely to meet RIC criteria (48% versus 34%; p < 0.001) but less likely to have VS (72% versus 81%; p = 0.048). Using multivariable logistic regression models (individual-level analysis for 1,001 individuals after excluding 93 deaths), both sustained RIC and VS at 3 years post-release were independently associated with older age (RIC: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.22-2.12; VS: AOR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.06-1.78), having health insurance (RIC: AOR = 2.15, 95% CI = 1.60-2.89; VS: AOR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.53-2.64), and receiving an increased number of transitional case management visits. The same factors were significant when we assessed RIC and VS outcomes in each 6-month period using generalized estimating equations (for 1,094 individuals contributing 6,227 6-month periods prior to death or censoring). Additionally, receipt of antiretroviral therapy during incarceration (RIC: AOR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.07-1.65; VS: AOR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.56-2.34), early linkage to care post-release (RIC: AOR = 2.64, 95% CI = 2.03-3.43; VS: AOR = 1.79; 95% CI = 1.45-2.21), and absolute time and proportion of follow-up time spent re-incarcerated were highly correlated with better treatment outcomes. Limited data were available on changes over time in injection drug use or other substance use disorders, psychiatric disorders, or housing status.
   Conclusions
   In a large cohort of CJ-involved PLWH with a 3-year post-release evaluation, RIC diminished significantly over time, but was associated with HIV care during incarceration, health insurance, case management services, and early linkage to care post-release. While re-incarceration and conditional release provide opportunities to engage in care, reducing recidivism and supporting community-based RIC efforts are key to improving longitudinal treatment outcomes among CJ-involved PLWH.

AB Background
   Evidence of the short-term effects of ambient air pollution on the risk of ischemic stroke in low-and middle-income countries is limited and inconsistent. We aimed to examine the associations between air pollution and daily hospital admissions for ischemic stroke in China.
   Methods and findings
   We identified hospital admissions for ischemic stroke in 2014-2016 from the national database covering up to 0.28 billion people who received Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) in China. We examined the associations between air pollution and daily ischemic stroke admission using a two-stage method. Poisson time-series regression models were firstly fitted to estimate the effects of air pollution in each city. Random-effects meta-analyses were then conducted to combine the estimates. Meta-regression models were applied to explore potential effect modifiers. More than 2 million hospital admissions for ischemic stroke were identified in 172 cities in China. In single-pollutant models, increases of 10 mu g/m(3) in particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <2.5 mu m (PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O-3) and 1 mg/m(3) in carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations were associated with 0.34% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20%-0.48%), 1.37% (1.05%-1.70%), 1.82% (1.45%-2.19%), 0.01% (-0.14%-0.16%), and 3.24% (2.05%-4.43%) increases in hospital admissions for ischemic stroke on the same day, respectively. SO2 and NO2 associations remained significant in two-pollutant models, but not PM2.5 and CO associations. The effect estimates were greater in cities with lower air pollutant levels and higher air temperatures, as well as in elderly subgroups. The main limitation of the present study was the unavailability of data on individual exposure to ambient air pollution.
   Conclusions
   As the first national study in China to systematically examine the associations between short-term exposure to ambient air pollution and ischemic stroke, our findings indicate that transient increase in air pollution levels may increase the risk of ischemic stroke, which may have significant public health implications for the reduction of ischemic stroke burden in China.

AB Background
   Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is characterised by a high degree of spatial clustering at all scales, and this feature remains even with successful control measures. VL is targeted for elimination as a public health problem in the Indian subcontinent by 2020, and incidence has been falling rapidly since 2011. Current control is based on early diagnosis and treatment of clinical cases, and blanket indoor residual spraying of insecticide (IRS) in endemic villages to kill the sandfly vectors. Spatially targeting active case detection and/or IRS to higher risk areas would greatly reduce costs of control, but its effectiveness as a control strategy is unknown. The effectiveness depends on two key unknowns: how quickly transmission risk decreases with distance from a VL case and how much asymptomatically infected individuals contribute to transmission.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   To estimate these key parameters, a spatiotemporal transmission model for VL was developed and fitted to geo-located epidemiological data on 2494 individuals from a highly endemic village in Mymensingh, Bangladesh. A Bayesian inference framework that could account for the unknown infection times of the VL cases, and missing symptom onset and recovery times, was developed to perform the parameter estimation. The parameter estimates obtained suggest that, in a highly endemic setting, VL risk decreases relatively quickly with distance from a case-halving within 90m-and that VL cases contribute significantly more to transmission than asymptomatic individuals.
   Conclusions/Significance
   These results suggest that spatially-targeted interventions may be effective for limiting transmission. However, the extent to which spatial transmission patterns and the asymptomatic contribution vary with VL endemicity and over time is uncertain. In any event, interventions would need to be performed promptly and in a large radius (>= 300m) around a new case to reduce transmission risk.

AB After obtaining certification of the absence of transmission of the Trypanosoma cruzi by Triatoma infestans in 2006, other native species of protozoan vectors have been found in human dwellings within municipalities of the State of Parana, Southern Brazil. However, the spatial distribution of T. cruzi vectors and how climatic and landscape combined variables explain the distribution are still poorly understood. The goal of this study was to predict the potential distribution of T. cruzi vectors as a proxy for Chagas disease transmission risk using Ecological Niche Models (ENMs) based on climatic and landscape variables. We hypothesize that ENM based on both climate and landscape variables are more powerful than climate-only or landscape-only models, and that this will be true independent of vector species. A total of 2,662 records of triatomines of five species were obtained by community-based entomological surveillance from 2007 to 2013. The species with the highest number of specimens was Panstrongylus megistus (73%; n = 1,943), followed by Panstrongylus geniculatus (15.4%; 411), Rhodnius neglectus (6.0%; 159), Triatoma sordida (4.5%; 119) and Rhodnius prolixus (1.1%; 30). Of the total, 71.9% were captured at the intradomicile. T. cruzi infection was observed in 19.7% of the 2,472 examined insects. ENMs were generated based on selected climate and landscape variables with 1 km(2) spatial resolution. Zonal statistics were used for classifying the municipalities as to the risk of occurrence of synanthropic triatomines. The integrated analysis of the climate and landscape suitability on triatomines geographical distribution was powerful on generating good predictive models. Moreover, this showed that some municipalities in the northwest, north and northeast of the Parana state have a higher risk of T. cruzivector transmission. This occurs because those regions present high climatic and landscape suitability values for occurrence of their vectors. The frequent invasion of houses by infected triatomines clearly indicates a greater risk of transmission of T. cruzi to the inhabitants. More public health attention should be given in the northern areas of the State of Parana, which presents high climate and landscape suitabilities for the disease vectors. In conclusion, our results through spatial analysis and predictive maps showed to be effective in identifying areas of potential distribution and, consequently, in the definition of strategic areas and actions to prevent new cases of Chagas' disease, reinforcing the need for continuous and robust surveillance in these areas.

TI Use of data-mining to support real-world cost analyses: An example using
   HER2-positive breast cancer in Iran
SO PLOS ONE

ID ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY; TRASTUZUMAB; TRIAL
AB Introduction
   Patient registries play an important role in obtaining real-world evidence of the cost-effectiveness of treatments. However, their implementation is costly and sometimes infeasible in many middle-income countries (MICs). We explored the combination of data-mining and a large claims database to estimate the direct healthcare costs of HER2-positive breast cancer (BC) treatment in Iran and the fraction of total costs from trastuzumab use.
   Method
   We performed a retrospective analysis of claims data from the Iran Social Security Organization, a health insurer which covers approximately 50%(-40 million) of the Iranian population, in the period of 21/03/2011-20/03/2014. A data-mining algorithm using R software and validated using patient dossiers in the Cancer Research Center identified 1295 patients and divided them into the three main HER2-positive breast cancer stages (early, loco-regional and advanced). A payer perspective was used to calculate the absolute and relative direct costs of healthcare services associated with the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer in the public and private healthcare systems.
   Results
   The number of women totaled 802 (early), 125 (loco-regional) and 218 (advanced). The mean age[SD] was 45[10], 46[10] and 48[10] years, respectively, while mean follow-up in all stages was approximately one year. Average costs of direct healthcare care in early, loco-regional and advanced stages were (sic)11,796 (95%CI: (sic)9,356-(sic)12,498), (sic)8,253 (95% CI: (sic)6,843-(sic)10,002), and (sic)17,742 (95%CI: (sic)15,720-(sic)19,505), respectively. Trastuzumab accounted for the largest share of total costs in all three stages (range: 53-76%).
   Conclusion
   Wherever comprehensive patient registries are infeasible or costly, real-world costs can be estimated through claims databases and data-mining strategies. Using this method, real-world costs have been estimated in Iran. The stage-specific cost estimates derived from this study can be used to perform real-world cost-effectiveness analyses of therapies for HER2-positive BC and support healthcare financing decisions.

AB Human diseases of zoonotic origin are a major public health problem. Simian foamy viruses (SFVs) are complex retroviruses which are currently spilling over to humans. Replicationcompetent SFVs persist over the lifetime of their human hosts, without spreading to secondary hosts, suggesting the presence of efficient immune control. Accordingly, we aimed to perform an in-depth characterization of neutralizing antibodies raised by humans infected with a zoonotic SFV. We quantified the neutralizing capacity of plasma samples from 58 SFV-infected hunters against primary zoonotic gorilla and chimpanzee SFV strains, and laboratory-adapted chimpanzee SFV. The genotype of the strain infecting each hunter was identified by direct sequencing of the env gene amplified from the buffy coat with genotypespecific primers. Foamy virus vector particles (FVV) enveloped by wild-type and chimeric gorilla SFV were used to map the envelope region targeted by antibodies. Here, we showed high titers of neutralizing antibodies in the plasma of most SFV-infected individuals. Neutralizing antibodies target the dimorphic portion of the envelope protein surface domain. Epitopes recognized by neutralizing antibodies have been conserved during the cospeciation of SFV with their nonhuman primate host. Greater neutralization breadth in plasma samples of SFV-infected humans was statistically associated with smaller SFV-related hematological changes. The neutralization patterns provide evidence for persistent expression of viral proteins and a high prevalence of coinfection. In conclusion, neutralizing antibodies raised against zoonotic SFV target immunodominant and conserved epitopes located in the receptor binding domain. These properties support their potential role in restricting the spread of SFV in the human population.

AB Use of tobacco products is injurious to health in men and women. However, tobacco use by pregnant women receives greater scrutiny because it can also compromise the health of future generations. More men smoke cigarettes than women. Yet the impact of nicotine use by men upon their descendants has not been as widely scrutinized. We exposed male C57BL/6 mice to nicotine (200 mu g/mL in drinking water) for 12 wk and bred the mice with drug-naive females to produce the F1 generation. Male and female F1 mice were bred with drug-naive partners to produce the F2 generation. We analyzed spontaneous locomotor activity, working memory, attention, and reversal learning in male and female F1 and F2 mice. Both male and female F1 mice derived from the nicotine-exposed males showed significant increases in spontaneous locomotor activity and significant deficits in reversal learning. The male F1 mice also showed significant deficits in attention, brain monoamine content, and dopamine receptor mRNA expression. Examination of the F2 generation showed that male F2 mice derived from paternally nicotine-exposed female F1 mice had significant deficits in reversal learning. Analysis of epigenetic changes in the spermatozoa of the nicotine-exposed male founders (F0) showed significant changes in global DNA methylation and DNA methylation at promoter regions of the dopamine D2 receptor gene. Our findings show that nicotine exposure of male mice produces behavioral changes in multiple generations of descendants. Nicotine-induced changes in spermatozoal DNA methylation are a plausible mechanism for the transgenerational transmission of the phenotypes. These findings underscore the need to enlarge the current focus of research and public policy targeting nicotine exposure of pregnant mothers by a more equitable focus on nicotine exposure of the mother and the father.

AB Background
   Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an emerging neglected mosquito-borne viral zoonotic disease of domestic animals and humans, with potential for global expansion. The objectives of this study were: to assess perceived relative burden and seasonality of RVF in nomadic cattle herds and validate the burden with sero-prevalence impact; and assess perceived risk factors associated with the disease and risk pathways for RVF virus in nomadic pastoral herds of North-central Nigeria using pastoralists' existing veterinary knowledge.
   Methods
   Participatory Epidemiology (PE) survey was conducted in Fulani nomadic pastoral communities domiciled in Niger State between January and December 2015. A cross-sectional sero-prevalence investigation was also carried out in nomadic pastoral cattle herds to validate outcomes of PE. A total of nine nomadic pastoral communities were purposively selected for qualitative impact assessment using Participatory Rural Appraisal tools, while 97 cattle randomly sampled from 15 purposively selected nomadic herds and had their sera analyzed using c-ELISA. Kendall's Coefficient of Concordance W statistics and OpenEpi 2.3.1 were used for statistical analyses.
   Results
   Mean proportional piles (relative burden) of RVF (Gabi-gabi(F)) was 8.3%, and nomads agreement on the burden was strong (W = 0.6855) and statistically significant (P<0.001). This was validated by 11.3% (11/97; 95% CI: 6.1-18.9) sero-positivity (quantitative impact). Mean matrix scores of prominent clinical signs associated with RVF were fever (3.1), anorexia (2.1), abortion (4.1), nasal discharge (3.3), neurological disorder (8.4), diarrhoea (3.2), and sudden death (4.4), with strong agreement (W = 0.6687) and statistically significant (p<0.001). Mean proportional piles of pastoralists' perceived risk factors identified to influenced RVF occurrence were: availability of mosquitoes (18 piles, 17.6%), high cattle density (16 piles, 15.9%) and high rainfall (12 piles, 12.2%). Agreement on the risk factors was strong (W = 0.8372) and statistically significant (p<0.01). Mean matrix scores for the Entry pathway of RVF virus into the nomadic pastoral herds were: presence of RVFV infected mosquitoes (tiny biting flies) (7.9), presence of infected cattle in herds (8.4), and contacts of herd with infected wild animals at grazing (10.1). Mean matrix scores for the Spread pathway of RVF virus in herds were bites of infected mosquitoes (5.1), contacts with infected aborted fetuses/fluids (7.8), and contaminated pasture with aborted fetuses/fluids (9.7). Agreement on risk pathways was strong (W = 0.6922) and statistically significant (p<0.03). Key informants scored RVF to occurred more in Damina or late rainy season (5.3), followed by Kaka or early dry season (3.3), with strong agreement (W = 0.8719) and statistically significant (P<0.01). This study highlighted the significant existing knowledge level about RVF contained in nomadic pastoralists.
   Conclusions
   The use of PE approach is needful in active surveillance of livestock diseases in pastoral communities domiciled in highly remote areas. RVF surveillance system, control and prevention programmes that take the identified risk factors and pathways into consideration will be beneficial to the livestock industry in Nigeria, and indeed Africa. An 'OneHealth' approach is needed to improve efficiency of RVF research, surveillance, prevention and control systems, so as to assure food security and public health in developing countries.

TI Leprosy in children under 15 years of age in Brazil: A systematic review
   of the literature
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Review
ID HANSENS-DISEASE; OLD
AB Background
   Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease neglected, caused by Mycobacterium leprae, considered a public health problem because may cause permanent physical disabilities and deformities, leading to severe limitations. This review presents an overview of the results of epidemiological studies on leprosy occurrence in childhood in Brazil, aiming to alert health planners and managers to the actual need to institute special control strategies.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   Data collection consisted of an electronic search for publications in eight databases: Literature Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Glandes da Sadde (LILACS), Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), PuBMed, Biblioteca Virtual em Sacide (BVS), SciVerse Scopus (Scopus), CAPES theses database, CAPES journals database and Web of Science of papers published up to 2016. After apply selection criteria, twenty-two papers of studies conducted in four different regions of Brazil and published between 2001 and 2016 were included in the review. The leprosy detection rate ranged from 10.9 to 78.4 per 100,000 inhabitants. Despite affecting both sexes, leprosy was more common in boys and in 10-14 year -olds. Although the authors reported a high cure proportion (82-90%), between 1.7% and 5.5% of the individuals developed a disability resulting from the disease.
   Conclusions/Significance
   The findings of this review shows that leprosy situation in Brazilian children under 15 years is extremely adverse in that the leprosy detection rate remains high in the majority of studies. The proportion of cases involving disability is also high and reflects the difficulties and the poor effectiveness of actions aimed at controlling the disease. The authors suggest the development of studies in spatial clusters of leprosy, where beyond the routine actions established, are included news strategies of active search and campaigns and actions of educations inside the clusters of this disease. The new agenda needs to involve the precepts of ethical, humane and supportive care, in order to achieve a new level of leprosy control in Brazil.

TI High accuracy of an ELISA test based in a flagella antigen of Leishmania

AB Background
   Canine Visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) is a serious public health problem, thus for its control, the Ministry of Health in Brazil recommends the rapid diagnosis and euthanasia of seropositive dogs in endemic areas. Therefore, our group had previously selected six recombinant proteins (rLci1, rLci2, rLci4, rLci5, rLci8, and rLci12) due to their high potential for CVL diagnostic testing. The present study aims to produce an immunodiagnostic test using the aforementioned antigens, to improve the performance of the diagnosis of CVL recommended by Brazilian Ministry of Health.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   To evaluate the recombinant proteins in the serological assays, positive and negative samples were selected based on parasitological test (culture) and molecular test (qPCR) of splenic aspirate. Initially, we selected 135 dog serum samples, 73 positives (symptomatic and asymptomatic) and 62 negatives to screen recombinant proteins on ELISA platform. Then, for rLci5 ELISA validation, 361 serum samples collected in a cross-sectional study were selected, being 183 positives (symptomatic and asymptomatic) and 178 negatives. In the screening of the recombinant proteins, rLci5 was the only protein to present a performance statistically higher than the performance presented by EIE-LVC test, presenting 96% (IC 95%; 85-99%) vs. 83% (IC 95%; 69-92%) of sensitivity for symptomatic dogs, 71% (IC 95%; 49-97%) vs. 54% (IC 95%; 33-74%) for asymptomatic dogs and 94% (IC 95%; 83-99%) vs, 88% (IC 95%; 76-95% of specificity. Thus, the rLci5 protein was selected to compose a final ELISA test. Validation of rLci5 ELISA showed 87% (IC 81-91%) of sensitivity, 94% (IC 95%; 90-97%) of specificity and 90% accuracy. Testing the EIE-LVC with the same validation panel, we observed a lower performance when compared to ELISA rLci5 (sensitivity of 67% (IC 95%; 59-74%), specificity of 87% (IC 95%; 81-92%), and accuracy of 77%). Finally, the performance of current CVL diagnostic protocol recommended by Brazilian Ministry of Health, using DPP-LVC as screening test and EIE-LVC as confirmatory test, was compared with a modified protocol, replacing EIE-LVC by rLci5 ELISA. The current protocol presented a sensitivity of 59% (IC 95%; 52-66%), specificity of 98% (IC 95%; 95-99%) and accuracy of 80% (IC 95%; 76-84%), while the modified protocol presented a sensitivity of 71% (IC 95%; 63-77%), specificity of 99% (IC 95%; 97-100%) and accuracy of 86% (IC 95%; 83-89%).
   Conclusion
   Thus, we concluded that rLci5 ELISA is a promising test to replace EIE-LVC test and increase the diagnostic performance of CVL in Brazil.

AB Background
   Human T-Lymphotropic Virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a human oncoretrovirus that infects at least 5 to 10 million people worldwide and is associated with severe diseases. Africa appears as the largest HTLV-1 endemic area. However, the risk factors for the acquisition of HTLV-1 remain poorly understood in Central Africa.
   Methods
   We conducted an epidemiological survey between 2013 and 2017, in rural areas of 6 provinces of Gabon, in a rainforest environment. Epidemiological data were obtained and blood samples were collected after informed consent. Plasma were screened for HTLV-1 antibodies by ELISA and the positive samples were then tested by Western blot (WB). Genomic DNA derived from buffy-coat was subjected to two semi-nested PCRs amplifying either HTLV-1 envgene or LTR region fragments.
   Results
   We recruited 2,060 individuals over 15 years old, including 1,205 men and 855 women (mean age: 49 years). Of these, 299 were found to be ELISA HTLV-1/2 seropositive. According to WB criteria, 136 were HTLV-1 (6.6%), 25 HTLV-1/2 (1.2%) and 9 HTLV seroreactive (0.4%). PCR results showed that 146 individuals were positive for at least one PCR: 104 for the env gene and 131 for the LTR region. Based on both serological and molecular results, 179 individuals were considered infected with HTLV-1, leading to an overall prevalence of 8.7%. The distribution of HTLV-1 infection was heterogeneous across the country. Based on multivariable analyses, female gender, increasing age, ethnicity (Pygmy) and multiple hospitalizations (more than 5 times) were found to be independent risk factors for HTLV-1 infection. Furthermore, a non-human primate bite appeared to be marginally associated with a higher risk of HTLV-1 infection.
   Conclusion
   Based on state-of-the-art serological and molecular methods, we have demonstrated that rural adult populations in Gabon are highly endemic for HTLV-1. Our results regarding risk factors should lead to public health actions aiming to reduce HTLV-1 transmission.

TI Field safety and effectiveness of new visceral leishmaniasis treatment

   FAILURE
AB Background
   In 2010, WHO recommended the use of new short-course treatment regimens in kala-azar elimination efforts for the Indian subcontinent. Although phase 3 studies have shown excellent results, there remains a lack of evidence on a wider treatment population and the safety and effectiveness of these regimens under field conditions.
   Methods
   This was an open label, prospective, non-randomized, non-comparative, multi-centric trial conducted within public health facilities in two highly endemic districts and a specialist referral centre in Bihar, India. Three treatment regimens were tested: single dose AmBisome (SDA), concomitant miltefosine and paromomycin (Milt+PM), and concomitant AmBisome and miltefosine (AmB+Milt). Patients with complicated disease or significant co-morbidities were treated in the SDA arm. Sample sizes were set at a minimum of 300 per arm, taking into account inter-site variation and an estimated failure risk of 5% with 5% precision. Outcomes of drug effectiveness and safety were measured at 6 months.
   Results
   Out of 1,761 patients recruited, 50.6% (n = 891) received SDA, 20.3% (n = 358) AmB+Milt and 29.1% (n = 512) Milt+PM. In the ITT analysis, the final cure rates were SDA 91.4% (95% CI 89.3-93.1), AmB+Milt 88.8% (95% CI 85.1-91.9) and Milt+PM 96.9% (95% CI 95.0-98.2). In the complete case analysis, cure rates were SDA 95.5% (95% CI 93.9-96.8), AmB+Milt 95.5% (95% CI 92.7-97.5) and Milt+PM 99.6% (95% CI 98.6-99.9). All three regimens were safe, with 5 severe adverse events in the SDA arm, two of which were considered to be drug related.
   Conclusion
   All regimens showed acceptable outcomes and safety profiles in a range of patients under field conditions. Phase IV field-based studies, although extremely rare for neglected tropical diseases, are good practice and an important step in validating the results of more restrictive hospital-based studies before widespread implementation, and in this case contributed to national level policy change in India.

AB BACKGROUND:
   Cholera remains an important public health problem in major cities in Bangladesh, especially in slum areas. In response to growing interest among local policymakers to control this disease, this study estimated the impact and cost-effectiveness of preventive cholera vaccination over a ten-year period in a high-risk slum population in Dhaka to inform decisions about the use of oral cholera vaccines as a key tool in reducing cholera risk in such populations.
   METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
   Assuming use of a two-dose killed whole-cell oral cholera vaccine to be produced locally, the number of cholera cases and deaths averted was estimated for three target group options (1-4 year olds, 1-14 year olds, and all persons 1+), using cholera incidence data from Dhaka, estimates of vaccination coverage rates from the literature, and a dynamic model of cholera transmission based on data from Matlab, which incorporates herd effects. Local estimates of vaccination costs minus savings in treatment costs, were used to obtain incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for one- and ten-dose vial sizes. Vaccinating 1-14 year olds every three years, combined with annual routine vaccination of children, would be the most cost-effective strategy, reducing incidence in this population by 45% (assuming 10% annual migration), and costing was $823 (2015 USD) for single dose vials and $591 (2015 USD) for ten-dose vials per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. Vaccinating all ages one year and above would reduce incidence by >90%, but would be 50% less cost-effective ($894-1,234/DALY averted). Limiting vaccination to 1-4 year olds would be the least cost-effective strategy (preventing only 7% of cases and costing $1,276-$1,731/DALY averted), due to the limited herd effects of vaccinating this small population and the lower vaccine efficacy in this age group.
   CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:
   Providing cholera vaccine to slum populations in Dhaka through periodic vaccination campaigns would significantly reduce cholera incidence and inequities, and be especially cost-effective if all 1-14 year olds are targeted.

TI Location, seasonal, and functional characteristics of water holding
   containers with juvenile and pupal Aedes aegypti in Southern Taiwan: A
   cross-sectional study using hurdle model analyses
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID COUNT DATA; DENGUE; CITY; CAMPAIGN; IMPACT; URBAN
AB Background
   Aedes aegypti carries several viruses of public health importance, including the dengue virus. Dengue is the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease in the world. Prevention and control of dengue mainly rely on mosquito control as there is no antiviral treatment or a WHO-approved vaccine. To reduce the Ae. aegypti population, studying the characteristics of their habitats is necessary. Aedes aegypti prefer breeding in artificial water holding containers in peridomestic or domestic settings. Their juveniles (1st - 4th instar larvae and pupae) have a tendency to cluster in certain types of containers. To inform control strategies, it is important to assess whether the pupae subgroup has a distinct distribution by container type as compared to the overall group of juveniles. The objective of this study was to assess for distinct predictors (location, season, and function) of Ae. aegypti juveniles and pupae numbers in water holding containers by applying hurdle model analyses.
   Methodology
   The field component of this study was carried out from November 2013 to July 2015 in Southern Taiwan where annual autochthonous dengue has been reported for decades. Water holding containers with stagnant water were identified in a predefined urban area in Kaohsiung City (KH) and a rural area in Pingtung County. Given that mosquito survey data often include many containers with zero Ae. aegypti, a negative binomial hurdle model was applied to model the association between location, seasonal and functional characteristics of the water holding containers and the number of Ae. aegypti in each container.
   Results
   The results showed that Ae. aegypti were almost exclusively present in the urban area. In this area, the negative binomial hurdle model predicted significantly more juveniles as well as pupae Ae. aegypti in water holding containers during the wet season when compared to the dry season. Notably, the model predicted more juveniles in containers located on private property compared to those on government property, irrespective of season. As for pupae, the model predicted higher amounts in indoor containers used for water storage compared to outdoor water storage containers, irrespective of season. However, for the specific category 'other water receptacle', higher amounts of pupae were predicted in outdoor compared to indoor in water receptacles, such as flower pot saucers and water catchment buckets.
   Conclusions
   The difference in predictors for juveniles and the pupae subgroup was identified and it may be of importance to the control strategies of the authorities in KH. At present the authorities focus control activities on all water holding containers found on government property. To improve the ongoing control efforts in KH, the focus of control activities maintained by the KH authorities should be expanded to indoor water storage containers and outdoor water receptacles on both private and government properties to adequately address habitats harboring greater numbers of pupae. In addition, it is proposed to increase community engagement in managing water in all types of water holding containers located on privately owned properties (indoor and outdoor), especially during wet season.

AB Dengue is a major public health problem worldwide. Although several drug candidates have been evaluated in randomized controlled trials, none has been effective and at present, early recognition of severe dengue and timely supportive care are used to reduce mortality. While the first dengue vaccine was recently licensed, and several other candidates are in late stage clinical trials, future decisions regarding widespread deployment of vaccines and/or therapeutics will require evidence of product safety, efficacy and effectiveness. Standard, quantifiable clinical endpoints are needed to ensure reproducibility and comparability of research findings. To address this need, we established a working group of dengue researchers and public health specialists to develop standardized endpoints and work towards consensus opinion on those endpoints. After discussion at two working group meetings and presentations at international conferences, a Delphi methodology-based query was used to finalize and operationalize the clinical endpoints. Participants were asked to select the best endpoints from proposed definitions or offer revised/new definitions, and to indicate whether contributing items should be designated as optional or required. After the third round of inquiry, 70% or greater agreement was reached on moderate and severe plasma leakage, moderate and severe bleeding, acute hepatitis and acute liver failure, and moderate and severe neurologic disease. There was less agreement regarding moderate and severe thrombocytopenia and moderate and severe myocarditis. Notably, 68% of participants agreed that a 50,000 to 20,000 mm(3) platelet range be used to define moderate thrombocytopenia; however, they remained divided on whether a rapid decreasing trend or one platelet count should be case defining. While at least 70% agreement was reached on most endpoints, the process identified areas for further evaluation and standardization within the context of ongoing clinical studies. These endpoints can be used to harmonize data collection and improve comparability between dengue clinical trials.

AB Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) programmes are used to collect data which are required to assess the impact of current interventions on their progress towards achieving the World Health Organization (WHO) goals of morbidity control and elimination as a public health problem for schistosomiasis. Prevalence and intensity of infection data are typically collected from school-aged children (SAC) as they are relatively easy to sample and are thought to be most likely to be infected by schistosome parasites. However, adults are also likely to be infected. We use three different age-intensity profiles of infection for Schistosoma mansoni with low, moderate and high burdens of infection in adults to investigate how the age distribution of infection impacts the mathematical model generated recommendations of the preventive chemotherapy coverage levels required to achieve the WHO goals. We find that for moderate prevalence regions, regardless of the burden of infection in adults, treating SAC only may achieve the WHO goals. However, for high prevalence regions with a high burden of infection in adults, adult treatment is required to meet the WHO goals. Hence, we show that the optimal treatment strategy for a defined region requires consideration of the burden of infection in adults as it cannot be based solely on the prevalence of infection in SAC. Although past epidemiological data have informed mathematical models for the transmission and control of schistosome infections, more accurate and detailed data are required from M&E programmes to accurately determine the optimal treatment strategy for a defined region. We highlight the importance of collecting prevalence and intensity of infection data from a broader age-range, specifically the inclusion of adult data at baseline (prior to treatment) and throughout the treatment programme if possible, rather than SAC only, to accurately determine the treatment strategy for a defined region. Furthermore, we discuss additional epidemiological data, such as individual longitudinal adherence to treatment, that should ideally be collected in M&E programmes.

ID RARE; VARIANTS; COMMON; TOOL
AB A primary goal of the recent investment in sequencing is to detect novel genetic associations in health and disease improving the development of treatments and playing a critical role in precision medicine. While this investment has resulted in an enormous total number of sequenced genomes, individual studies of complex traits and diseases are often smaller and underpowered to detect rare variant genetic associations. Existing genetic resources such as the Exome Aggregation Consortium (>60,000 exomes) and the Genome Aggregation Database (similar to 140,000 sequenced samples) have the potential to be used as controls in these studies. Fully utilizing these and other existing sequencing resources may increase power and could be especially useful in studies where resources to sequence additional samples are limited. However, to date, these large, publicly available genetic resources remain underutilized, or even misused, in large part due to the lack of statistical methods that can appropriately use this summary level data. Here, we present a new method to incorporate external controls in case-control analysis called ProxECAT (Proxy External Controls Association Test). ProxECAT estimates enrichment of rare variants within a gene region using internally sequenced cases and external controls. We evaluated ProxECAT in simulations and empirical analyses of obesity cases using both low-depth of coverage (7x) whole-genome sequenced controls and ExAC as controls. We find that ProxECAT maintains the expected type I error rate with increased power as the number of external controls increases. With an accompanying R package, ProxECAT enables the use of publicly available allele frequencies as external controls in case-control analysis.

AB Background: Dietary supplements (DS) are nutraceuticals that improve overall health and well-being of an individual as well as reduce the risk of diseases. Evidence indicates a rising prevalence of these products worldwide especially among college students. Studies have reported an increasing use of supplements among Saudi students. However, the scope of those researches was limited to prevalence data. Hence, the aim of our study was to document the prevalence, opinions, attitudes, reasons for use and monthly cost attributed to dietary supplement use.
   Methods: A 3-month cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate use of dietary supplement among health and non-health college students at a public-sector university in Dammam city, Saudi Arabia. It was conducted using Arabic version of the Dietary supplement questionnaire (DSQ-A). A total of 469 male students responded to the survey giving a response rate of 93.8%. The students were from ten colleges of the university. The data was analyzed by SPSS version 22. The study was approved by Institutional Review Board of Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia (IRB-UGS-2018-05-074).
   Results: The overall prevalence of dietary supplement use in the university was 29.42%. In health cluster colleges, it was reported at 35.91% while in non-health cluster college it was 23.69%. Maintaining general health and well-being was the most common reason for use. Prevalence of multivitamins and whey proteins was approximately 23%. Average monthly cost of supplement was SAR 278.92 (USD 74.39). Cost was positively correlated (rho = 0.305) with satisfaction score. Students preferred brand products (16.4%). 41.4% students opined that DS may prevent chronic illness if used regularly and agreed that they are good for health. Majority of students (65%) recommended DS use only upon physician's recommendation. College clusters and study-year was associated (p-value< 0.01) with students' opinion. Students in health cluster colleges were more likely to recommend supplements (OR 3.715, p-value< 0.0001).
   Conclusion: Prevalence of dietary supplement use was lower than other local and international university students. Health cluster colleges had higher prevalence as compared to non-health cluster colleges. Multivitamins and whey protein were the most commonly used types of DS. Students preferred brand products, had positive opinions and attitudes towards dietary supplement. However, they recommended supplements use to others only upon a physician's recommendation.

   Methods: We recruited adult women residing in an urban, resource-poor setting and attending maternal and child health clinics in two public hospitals in Nairobi, Kenya. A translated Kiswahili Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale was used to screen for depressive symptoms at baseline assessment in the 3rd trimester and follow up assessment at 6-10 weeks postpartum. Information was collected on potential demographic, psychosocial and clinical risk variables. Potential risk factors for postpartum depression were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis.
   Results: Out of the 171 women who were followed up at 6-10 weeks postpartum, 18.7% (95% CI: 13.3-25.5) were found to have postpartum depression using an EPDS cut off of 10. In multivariate analyses, the odds of having postpartum depression was increased more than seven-fold in the presence of conflict with partner (OR = 7.52, 95% CI: 2.65-23.13). The association between antepartum and postpartum depression was quite strong but did not reach statistical significance (OR = 3.37, 95% CI: 0.98-11.64).
   Conclusions: The high prevalence of significant postnatal depressive symptoms among Kenyan women underscores the need for addressing this public health burden. Depression screening and psychosocial support interventions that address partner conflict resolution should be offered as part of maternal health care.

TI Challenges of achieving sustainable community health services for
   community case management of malaria
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Community case Management of Malaria; Challenges; Sustainability;
   Community health workers
ID CHILDREN; HOME
AB Background: Community Case Management of malaria (CCMm) using Community Health Workers (CHWs) is an approach to improve access to timely and effective malaria case management in malaria endemic countries. So far the programme has been shown to be effective in many communities in sub-Saharan Africa. However, questions remain on the sustainability of this programme due to the high dropout cases of CHWs given their modest remuneration. The aim of the study was to identify challenges of achieving sustainable community health services for CCMm.
   Methods: A community based qualitative study was conducted in five districts in western Kenya where CCMm was being undertaken. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with the CHWs, mothers of children under-five years and key informants such as public health officers and clinicians involved in the CCMm. The interviews were audio recorded and conducted in English, Swahili and the local language. Recorded interviews were transcribed. Analysis was conducted using NVivo version 7 software, where transcripts were coded after which themes related to the objectives of the study were identified.
   Results: The community members, the CHWs and stakeholders perceived CCMm as an important approach for reducing the burden of malaria. Key informants perceived lack of basic supplies (RDTs, gloves), drugs, inadequate remuneration of CHWs and lack of basic working equipment as challenges for CCM. CHWs highlighted that lack of drugs and basic supplies such as gloves at the health facilities, inadequate community sensitization by health workers, inadequate stipend to meet basic needs, as challenges of achieving sustainable CCMm. Some clinicians perceived that CHWs should not be given Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) as part of the CCMm since they might misuse them.
   Conclusion: This study shows that for CCMm to be sustainable, concerted efforts from stakeholders are needed to boost the programme. Commodities needed for implementation of the programme need to be readily available and the morale of the CHWs who undertake CCMm needs boosting.

   EXERCISE; PEOPLE; ASSOCIATION; COMMUNITY; PAIN
AB Objectives
   To evaluate the perceptions of the general public and healthcare practitioners (HCP) in Canada about the relationship between running and knee joint health, and to explore HCP's usual recommendations to runners with knee osteoarthritis (KOA).
   Methods
   Non-runners and runners (with and without KOA) and HCP completed an online survey regarding the safety of running for knee joint health. HCP also provided information related to usual clinical recommendations. Proportions of agreement were compared between non-runners and runners.
   Results
   A total of 114 non-runners, 388 runners and 329 HCP completed the survey. Overall, running was perceived as detrimental for the knee joint by 13.1% of the general public, while 25.9% were uncertain. More uncertainty was reported regarding frequent (33.9%) and long-distance (43.6%) running. Statistical analyses revealed greater proportions of non-runners perceiving running negatively compared with runners. Overall, 48.4% believed that running in the presence of KOA would lead to disease progression, while 53.1% believed running would lead to premature arthroplasty. In HCP, 8.2%, 9.1% and 22.2% perceived that running in general, running frequently, or running long-distances are risk factors for KOA, respectively. 37.1% and 2.7% of HCP typically recommended patients with KOA to modify their running training or to quit running, respectively.
   Conclusion
   High rates of uncertainty among the general public and HCP in Canada outline the need for further studies about running and knee joint health. Filling knowledge gaps will help inform knowledge translation strategies to better orientate the general public and HCP about the safety of running for knee joint health.

TI Knowledge of preconception care among healthcare providers working in
   public health institutions in Hawassa, Ethiopia
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID RECOMMENDATIONS; DETERMINANTS; WOMEN
AB Background
   Preconception care (PCC) is an evidence-based health promotion intervention to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes. Nevertheless, it is one of the missing elements within the continuum of maternal and child healthcare. Despite the WHO's recommendation, most of the developing countries have not yet started implementing preconception care. Objective To determine the knowledge level of healthcare providers about PCC and to identify predictors of effective knowledge of preconception care.
   Method
   This is a cross-sectional study conducted among 634 healthcare providers (HCP) working in public health institutions of Hawassa. A pilot-tested and validated self-administered survey tool was used to collect data from individual healthcare providers who were selected randomly using a multistage sampling technique. The data entry and analysis were conducted using SPSS version 20 software. Frequency, proportions, means and standard deviations were used to describe the data. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were implemented to determine the predictors of HCP's PCC knowledge.
   Results
   Only a few (31%) of the healthcare providers demonstrated a good level of knowledge on preconception care. The odds of having good PCC knowledge was high among HCPs working in hospitals (AOR = 1.8, 95% C.I. 1.3-2.6), HCPs using their smart phone to access clinical resources (AOR = 1.4, 95% C.I. 1.1-2.0), among those HCPs ever have read PCC guideline prepared by organization outside of Ethiopia (AOR = 1.9, 95% C.I. 1.4-2.7), among those who claimed practicing PCC (AOR = 3.4, 95% C.I. 2.0-5.9), and among those who earn salary of >= 146.0 $(AOR = 1.5, 95% C.I. 1.1-2.1).
   Conclusion
   There is an unacceptably low level of knowledge about PCC among most of the healthcare providers in public health facilities in Ethiopia. The predictors identified in this study can be used to enhance the knowledge of healthcare providers about preconception care.

   CARE; ASSOCIATION; PROGRESSION; POPULATION; DIALYSIS
AB Introduction
   Diabetes is the most common cause of chronic kidney disease, with a high economic impact on health systems.
   Objective
   To estimate the cost of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) attributable to diabetes, stratified by sex, race/skin color, and age, from the perspective of the Brazilian public health system between 2010 and 2016.
   Methods
   Population attributable risk (PAR) was calculated from the Brazilian prevalence of diabetes and the relative risk (or odds ratio) of persons with diabetes developing CKD and ESKD as compared to non-diabetic subjects. The variables of interest were sex, race/skin color, and age. A top-down approach was used to measure the direct costs of the disease reimbursed by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, using data from outpatient and inpatient records.
   Results
   The cost of CKD and ESKD attributable to diabetes in the period 2010-2016 was US$1.2 billion (US$180 million per year) and trending upward. Female sex, age 65-75, and black race/skin color contributed substantially to the costs of CKD and ESKD (US$475 million, US $63 million, and US$25 million respectively). The clinical procedures accounting for the greatest share of disease-attributable costs are hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.
   Conclusion
   Diabetes accounted for 22% of the costs of CKD and ESKD. Female sex, age 65-75 years, and black race/skin color were the variables which contributed most to disease-related expenditure. The economic burden of CKD may increase gradually in the coming years, with serious implications for the financial sustainability of the Brazilian public health system.

AB Background: The World Health Organization recommends all men who have sex with men (MSM) receive Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) testing. MSM in China are a high-risk group for HBV and HCV infection, but test uptake is low. Crowdsourcing invites a large group to solve a problem and then shares the solution with the public. This nationwide online randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effectiveness of a crowdsourced intervention to increase HBV and HCV testing among MSM in China.
   Methods: Seven hundred MSM will be recruited through social media operated by MSM organizations in China. Eligible participants will be born biologically male, age 16 years or older, report previous anal sex with another man, and reside in China. After completing a baseline online survey, participants will be randomly assigned to intervention or control arms with a 1:1 allocation ratio. The intervention will include two components: (1) a multimedia component will deliver two videos and two images promoting HBV and HCV testing developed through a crowdsourcing contest in China; (2) a participatory component will invite men to submit suggestions for how to improve crowdsourced videos and images. The control arm will not view any images or videos and will not be invited to submit suggestions. All participants will be offered reimbursement for HBV and HCV testing costs. The primary outcome is HBV and HCV test uptake confirmed through electronic submission of test report photos within four weeks of enrolment. Secondary outcomes include self-reported HBV and HCV test uptake, HBV vaccination uptake, and change in stigma toward people living with HBV after four weeks. Primary and secondary outcomes will be calculated using intention to treat and as-exposed analyses and compared using two-sided 95% confidence intervals.
   Discussion: Few previous studies have evaluated interventions to increase HBV and HCV testing in middle-income countries with a high burden of hepatitis. Delivering a crowdsourced intervention using social media is a novel approach to increasing hepatitis testing rates. HBV and HCV test uptake will be confirmed through test report photos, avoiding the limitations of self-reported testing outcomes.

AB Background: Socioeconomic inequalities in cardiovascular morbidity have been previously reported showing direct associations between socioeconomic disadvantage and worse health outcomes. However, disagreement remains regarding the strength of the direct associations. The main objective of this panel design was to inspect socioeconomic gradients in admission to a coronary care unit (CCU) or an intensive care unit (ICU) among adult patients presenting with non-traumatic chest pain in three acute-care public hospitals in Victoria, Australia, during 2009-2013.
   Methods: Consecutive adults aged 18 or over presenting with chest pain in three emergency departments (ED) in Victoria, Australia during the five-year study period were eligible to participate. A relative index of inequality of socioeconomic status (SES) was estimated based on residential postcode socioeconomic index for areas (SEIFA) disadvantage scores. Admission to specialised care units over repeated presentations was modelled using a multivariable Generalized Estimating Equations approach that accounted for various socio-demographic and clinical variables.
   Results: Non-traumatic chest pain accounted for 10% of all presentations in the emergency departments (ED). A total of 53,177 individuals presented during the study period, with 22.5% presenting more than once. Of all patients, 17,579 (33.1%) were hospitalised over time, of whom 8584 (48.8%) were treated in a specialised care unit. Female sex was independently associated with fewer admissions to CCU / ICU, whereas, a dose-response effect of socioeconomic disadvantage and admission to CCU / ICU was found, with risk of admission increasing incrementally as SES declined. Patients coming from the lowest SES locations were 27% more likely to be admitted to these units compared with those coming from the least disadvantaged locations, p < 0.001. Men were significantly more likely to be admitted to such units than similarly affected and aged women among those diagnosed with angina pectoris, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, heart failure, chest pain, and general signs and symptoms.
   Conclusions: This study is the first to report socioeconomic gradients in admission to CCU / ICU in patients presenting with chest pain showing a dose-response effect. Our findings suggest increased cardiovascular morbidity as socioeconomic disadvantage increases.

AB In many industrialised countries, public rejection of intensive animal production systems has led to the development of legislation and industry actions that have resulted in significant changes in animal care at the farm level. However, little is known about the views of citizens from emerging countries regarding animal production. The aims of this study were to explore the views of Brazilian and Chilean consumers towards egg farming, and to investigate if these views are associated with participants' eggs purchasing habits and reported willingness to pay (WTP) more for eggs produced in the conditions they perceive as important. In an open question, participants (n = 716) were asked to describe an ideal egg production farm and explain their reasons. This was followed by closed questions asking egg purchasing habits, willingness to pay for eggs produced in the conditions they perceive as important and demographic information. Participants main concerns were with animal welfare, naturalness, hygiene, production, and ethical aspects, which many associated with improved health, sensory, and nutritional quality of the eggs. The views of participants towards an ideal egg production farm were associated, to some extent, with type of egg purchasing habits and WTP a premium for organic or free-range eggs. Our results suggest a demand for more natural, animal friendly egg production systems; furthermore, they indicate a disconnect between lay citizens' expectations and industry practices, given that intensive confined systems typically fail to supply many of the expected characteristics.

AB Acne vulgaris has been associated with deficits in psychological well-being and health-related quality of life. Few studies have investigated how stigma contributes to our understanding of the well-being of acne sufferers, although it is clear that acne is stigmatized and stigmatization is associated with impaired well-being. The current study aimed to investigate the ability of perceived stigma to predict health-related quality of life, psychological distress, and somatic symptoms over and above established predictors. University students and staff suffering from acne completed self-report measures online. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that perceived stigma significantly contributed to the prediction of all three well-being measures, over and above the effects of gender, acne severity, acne location, and use of medication. Indeed, perceived stigma made the largest unique contribution to predicting well-being. Our findings suggest that interventions that attempt to counter stigma could also improve the overall well-being of people affected by acne.

AB Background: Refugees are generally considered a vulnerable population, with refugee children (newborn and young children) being particularly so. Access to healthcare for this population remains a challenge. The main purpose of this study was to explore refugee caregivers' perceptions of their children's access to quality health service delivery to their young children in Durban, South Africa.
   Methods: This study used an explanatory mixed methods design, purposively sampling 120 and 10 participants for the quantitative and qualitative phases, respectively. Participants were administered a self-developed questionnaire that assessed demographic information of participants, socioeconomic status and living standard, medical history of children, satisfaction and experiences with healthcare services and refugees' networks and social support. A semistructured interview schedule was developed to elicit in-depth and more detailed information from the participants on the quantitative areas that were investigated. Frequencies were calculated and a.2 test was used to explore the factors associated with refugees' satisfaction of the healthcare provided and thematic analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data.
   Results: The majority (89%) of caregivers were women, with over 70% of them aged between 30 and 35 years. Over 74% of caregivers visited public clinics for their children's healthcare needs. The majority of caregivers (95%) were not satisfied with healthcare services delivery to their children due to the long waiting hours and the negative attitudes and discriminatory behaviours of healthcare workers, particularly in public healthcare facilities.
   Conclusion: These findings underscore the need to address health professionals' attitudes when providing healthcare for refugees. Attitudinal change may improve the relationship between service providers and caregivers of refugee children in South Africa, which may improve the health-related outcomes in refugee children.

TI Is quality of care during childbirth consistent from admission to
   discharge? A qualitative study of delivery care in Uttar Pradesh, India
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH FACILITIES; NEWBORN HEALTH; IMPROVEMENT; BIRTHS
AB Background
   Improving quality of maternal healthcare services is key to reducing maternal mortality across developing nations, including India. Expanding access to institutionalized care alone has failed to address critical quality barriers to safe, effective, patient-centred, timely and equitable care. Multi-dimensional quality improvement focusing on Person Centred Care (PCC) has an important role in expanding utilization of maternal health services and reducing maternal mortality.
   Methods
   Nine public health facilities were selected in two rural districts of Uttar Pradesh(UP), India, to understand women's experiences of childbirth and identify quality gaps in the process of maternity care. 23 direct, non-participant observations of uncomplicated vaginal deliveries were conducted using checklists with special reference to PCC, capturing quality of care provision at five stages D admission; pre-delivery; delivery; post-delivery and discharge. Data was thematically analysed using the framework approach. Case studies, good practices and gaps were noted at each stage of delivery care.
   Results
   Admission to maternity wards was generally prompt. All deliveries were conducted by skilled providers and at least one staff was available at all times. Study findings were discussed under two broad themes of care 'structure' and 'process'. While infrastructure, supplies and human resource were available across most facilities, gaps were observed in the process of care, particularly during delivery and post-delivery stages. Key areas of concern included compromised patient safety like poor hand hygiene, usage of unsterilized instruments; inadequate clinical care like lack of routine monitoring of labour progression, inadequate postpartum care; partially compromised privacy in the labour room and postnatal ward; and few incidents of abuse and demand for informal payments.
   Conclusions
   The study findings reflect gaps in the quality of maternity care across public health facilities in the study area and support the argument for strengthening PCC as an important effort towards quality improvement across the continuum of delivery care.

AB Objectives
   Neonatal deaths account for 45% of all under-five deaths globally and 60% in Bangladesh. This study aimed to investigate the most common symptoms and complications in neonates, care-seeking practices of the mothers for their sick neonates, and factors associated with the care-seeking practices.
   Methods
   This cross-sectional study analysed data from an Endline Household Survey (as part of an evaluation of a paired cluster-randomised controlled trial study in 14 rural sub-districts in Bangladesh) of 2,931 women who gave birth recently. Descriptive analysis and logistic regressions were conducted to identify the care-seeking practices of mothers of sick neonates and the factors associated with the care-seeking from trained providers.
   Results
   Of the 2868 neonates, 886 (30.9%) were reported ill during first 28 days after birth. For those with reported symptoms, 748 (84.4%) of their mothers sought care. Of those who sought care, 65.2% sought care from untrained providers. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed significantly higher odds of care-seeking from trained providers when neonates had 3 or more concurrent symptoms (OR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.07-3.08); when mothers perceived their neonates' symptoms as severe (OR: 4.08; 95% CI: 2.92-5.70); when mothers received skilled care during pregnancy (OR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.34-2.84); and when mothers had their delivery in a facility (OR: 3.50; 95% CI: 2.18-5.62). Mothers who delivered their babies at a facility, 43.1% of them sought care for their sick neonates at the same type of public hospital and 34.9% from same type of private hospitals where their deliveries took place.
   Conclusion
   Skilled care for mothers during pregnancy and delivery, and mothers' perceptions of the severity of symptoms are the key associated factors of care-seeking for sick neonates from trained providers. Interventions should be tailored to increase care from trained providers during pregnancy and delivery at facilities to improve care-seeking for neonates from trained providers and for the survival of neonates.

AB Background
   Behaviour-change interventions have been consistently considered an essential part of comprehensive HIV, STI and unintended pregnancy prevention. In 2015, the World Health Organization reviewed and assessed existing evidence on brief behavioural interventions, leading to the publication of Brief sexuality-related communication: recommendations for a public health approach. This guideline recommends the use of brief behaviour intervention and communication programmes to promote sexual health and to prevent HIV, STIs, and unintended pregnancies in primary health services, particularly sexual and reproductive health services.
   Objective
   With the purpose of informing the development of a brief behaviour intervention in sexual and reproductive health, we conducted a systematic review of brief intervention to prevent HIV, STI and unintended pregnancies, to identify behaviour change techniques (BCTs) used in health care settings.
   Methods
   Participants from all ages and genders were included. Brief interventions delivered in <= 60 minutes were included. Data was extracted, and interventions were coded following the Behaviour Change Techniques Taxonomy (BCTTv1) guidelines.
   Results
   Of the 6.687 articles identified, 355 were reviewed and 37 studies were included. In effective interventions, we identified 48 behaviour change techniques (BCTs). A core set of 8 frequently used behaviour change techniques was identified: "Problem solving", "Feedback on behaviour", "Social support (unspecified)", "Instructions on how to perform the behaviour", "Information about health consequences", "Information about social and environmental consequences", "Demonstration of the behaviour" and "Credible source".
   Conclusions
   The technical content of brief behaviour interventions was identified in a reliable and standardized way providing preliminary indications on potentially effective techniques to achieve behaviour change.

TI Determinants of frequency and contents of antenatal care visits in
   Bangladesh: Assessing the extent of compliance with the WHO
   recommendations
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MATERNAL HEALTH; SEEKING BEHAVIOR; PRENATAL-CARE; QUALITY; SERVICES;
   COMPLICATIONS; DELIVERY; IMPACT
AB Background
   In addition to the number of antenatal care (ANC) visits, the items of ANC services covered by ANC visits greatly influence the effectiveness of the ANC services. Recently the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended not only to achieve a minimum of eight ANC visits, but also to use a core set of items of ANC services for safe motherhood. This study examined the levels and determinants of frequency and contents of ANC visits in Bangladesh and thus assessed the level of compliance with the WHO recommended number and the content of ANC services during pregnancy in Bangladesh.
   Methods
   The data for the study come from the 2014 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS), which covereda nationally representative sample of 17,863 ever-married women aged 15-49 years. Data derived from 4,627 mothers who gave birth in the three years preceding the survey constituted the study subjects. Descriptive, inferential and multivariate statistical techniques were used for data analysis.
   Results
   On average, mothers received less than three (2.7 visits) ANC visits and only 6% receive the recommended eight or more ANC visits. About 22% of the mothers received all the prescribed basic items of ANC services. About one-fifth (21%) of the mothers never received ANC visits and thus no items of ANC services. Measurement of blood pressure was the most common item received during ANC visit as reported by 69% mothers. Blood test was the least received item (43%). Significant positive association was found between frequency of ANC visits and receiving the increased number of items of ANC services. High socio-economic status, low parity, living in urban areas and certain administrative regions, planned pregnancies, having media exposure, visiting skilled providers for ANC services and visit to public or NGO health facilities are associated with frequent ANC visits and receiving higher number of items of ANC contents.
   Conclusion
   An unsatisfactory level of coverage of and content of ANC visits have been observed in Bangladesh. Further investigation is needed to identify the causes of under-utilization of ANC services in Bangladesh. A greater understanding of the identified risk factors and incorporating them into short and long term strategies would help improve the coverage and contents and thus quality of ANC services in Bangladesh.

AB Introduction
   Typhoid fever (TF) continues to cause considerable morbidity and mortality in Nepal, but only limited epidemiologic data is available about TF outside Kathmandu.
   Methods
   As part of an interventional trial, we performed a prospective cohort study of bacteremic TF patients in Dhulikhel Hospital between October 2012 and October 2014. Demographic, epidemiological, clinical, and microbiologic data were recorded.
   Results
   116 bacteremic typhoid patients were included in the study. Most were young, healthy, adults (mean age 27.9 +/- 12 years), 41.4% of whom were female. More than 70% of patients were employed in non-manual services or were university students. Salmonella Typhi accounted for 64/115 (55.7%) of all isolates, while Salmonella Paratyphi accounted for 51/115 (44.3%), of which 42 were Paratyphi A and 9 Paratyphi B. A significant proportion of TF cases occurred also during the dry season (48/116, 41.6%). The clinical presentation of Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi infections was similar, except for a greater proportion of arthralgia in patients with Salmonella Typhi. Most Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid and susceptible to older antibiotics. One Salmonella Paratyphi isolate was resistant to ceftriaxone.
   Conclusions
   TF remains common in the Dhulikhel area, even among those with a high level of education. Public health measures aimed at reducing the incidence of TF in the Dhulikhel area are warranted. The relative burden of TF caused by Salmonella Paratyphi is rising; a vaccine with activity against Salmonella Paratyphi is needed. Since Salmonella Paratyphi B was more prevalent in this cohort than in large cohorts of patients from Kathmandu, it is likely that there are significant regional variations in the epidemiology of TF outside Kathmandu.

TI Large-scale health disparities associated with Lyme disease and human

AB Promoting health equity is a fundamental public health objective, yet health disparities remain largely overlooked in studies of vectorborne diseases, especially those transmitted by ticks. We sought to identify health disparities associated with Lyme disease and human monocytic ehrlichiosis, two of the most pervasive tickborne diseases within the United States. We used general linear mixed models to measure associations between county-level disease incidence and six variables representing racial/ethnic and socioeconomic characteristics of counties (percent white non-Hispanic; percent with a bachelors degree or higher; percent living below the poverty line; percent unemployed; percent of housing units vacant; per capita number of property crimes). Two ecological variables important to tick demography (percent forest cover; density of white-tailed deer) were included in secondary analyses to contextualize findings. Analyses included data from 2,695 counties in 37 states and the District of Columbia during 2007-2013. Each of the six variables was significantly associated with the incidence of one or both diseases, but the direction and magnitude of associations varied by disease. Results suggested that the incidence of Lyme disease was highest in counties with relatively higher proportions of white and more educated persons and lower poverty and crime rates; the incidence of human monocytic ehrlichiosis was highest in counties with relatively higher proportions of white and less educated persons, higher unemployment rates and lower crime rates. The percentage of housing units vacant was a strong positive predictor for both diseases with a magnitude of association comparable to those between incidence and the ecological variables. Our findings indicate that racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in disease incidence appear to be epidemiologically important features of Lyme disease and human monocytic ehrlichiosis in the United States. Steps to mitigate encroachment of wild flora and fauna into areas with vacant housing might be warranted to reduce disease risk.

ID ETHNIC DISPARITIES; OUTCOMES; QUALITY; SYSTEM; IMPACT
AB Background: The Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) model is a coordinated-care model that has served as a means to improve several chronic disease outcomes and reduce management costs. However, access to PCMH has not been explored among adults suffering from chronic conditions in the United States. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe the changes in receiving PCMH among adults suffering from chronic conditions that occurred from 2010 through 2015 and to identify predisposing, enabling, and need factors associated with receiving a PCMH.
   Methods: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted for adults with chronic conditions, using data from the 2010-2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys (MEPS). Most common chronic conditions in the United States were identified by using the most recent data published by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The definition established by the AHRQ was used as the basis to determine whether respondents had access to PCMH. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to detect the association between the different variables and access to PCMH care.
   Results: A total of 20,403 patients with chronic conditions were identified, representing 213.7 million U.S. lives. Approximately 19.7% of the patients were categorized as the PCMH group at baseline who met all the PCMH criteria defined in this paper. Overall, the percentage of adults with chronic conditions who received a PCMH decreased from 22.3% in 2010 to 17.8% in 2015. The multivariate analyses revealed that several subgroups, including individuals aged 66 and older, separated, insured by public insurance or uninsured, from low-income families, residing in the South or the West, and with poor health, were less likely to have access to PCMH.
   Conclusion: Our findings showed strong insufficiencies in access to a PCMH between 2010 and 2015, potentially driven by many factors. Thus, more resources and efforts need to be devoted to reducing the barriers to PCMH care which may improve the overall health of Americans with chronic conditions.

AB Background: The level of quality of care of ambulatory services in Switzerland is almost completely unknown. By adapting existing instruments to the Swiss national context, the present project aimed to define quality indicators (QI) for the measurement of quality of primary care for use on health insurance claims data. These data are preexisting and available nationwide which provides an excellent opportunity for their use in the context of health care quality assurance.
   Methods: Pragmatic 6-step process based on informal consensus. Potential QI consisted of recommendations extracted from internationally accepted medical practice guidelines and pre-existing QI for primary care. An independent interdisciplinary group of experts rated potential QI based on explicit criteria related to evidence, relevance for Swiss public health, and controllability in the Swiss primary care context. Feasibility of a preliminary set of QI was tested using claims data of persons with basic mandatory health insurance with insurance at one of the largest Swiss health insurers. This test built the basis for expert consensus on the final set of QI.
   Results: Of 49 potential indicators, 23 were selected for feasibility testing based on claims data. The expert group consented a final set of 24 QI covering the domains general aspects/efficiency (7 QI), drug safety (2), geriatric care (4), respiratory disease (2), diabetes (5) and cardiovascular disease (4).
   Conclusions: The present project provides the first nationwide applicable explicit evidence-based criteria to measure quality of care of ambulatory primary care in Switzerland. The set intends to increase transparency related to quality and variance of care in Switzerland.

AB Background: Few early intervention programs aimed at maternal and child health have been developed to be integrated in the existing Child Health Service in a country where the service is free, voluntary and used by the majority of the eligible population. This study presents the process and the critical steps in developing the "New Mothers" program.
   Methods: Formative research uses a mixed method, allowing us to obtain data from multiple sources. A scoping review provided information on early intervention programs and studies, clarifying key elements when framing a new program. Key informant and focus group interviews offered insight of existing challenges, perceptions, identified power structures and offered reflections germane to the identified framework, securing user involvement at all stages. Monthly meetings with the project group enabled feedback loops for the data, securing program advancement.
   Results: The "New Mothers" program was formed based on a salutogenic theory, emphasizing resistance and strengths. Public health nurses in the existing Child Health Service were to offer universally all first-time mothers and children home visits from gestational week 28 until the child reached 2 years, with motivational interviewing and empathic communication as methods to mentor the mothers, help them identify their strengths and resources, and provide support and information.
   Conclusions: Using formative research as mixed method ensures incorporation of detailed information from multiple resources when an early intervention program is developed. This method secured program appropriateness, both culturally and at system level, when integrating new elements in the existing service.

AB Background: Substance use disorder is an important public health problem and one of the major causes of disability worldwide. Substance use and criminal behavior are closely related and there is a significant association between substance misuse and crime, but little is known about substance use disorder among prisoners, in particular in low-income countries. Therefore, we investigated substance use disorder and associated factors in inmates of a correctional institution in Jimma, Southwest Ethiopia.
   Methods: We used a cross-sectional study design to collect data from 336 prisoners from June 5 to July 5, 2017. Study participants were selected from the total of 1460 prisoners eligible for the study by a systematic random sampling technique, i.e., one participant was randomly selected from every four consecutive admissions in the registration book. Alcohol use disorder, nicotine dependence, khat abuse, cannabis use disorder, psychopathy, adverse traumatic life events, and social support were assessed. Data were entered into EpiData version 3.1 and analyzed in bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models with the Statistical Package for Social Science version 21. Variables with a P value < 0.05 in the final fitting model were declared to be associated with the outcome variable.
   Results: The overall prevalence of substance use disorder was 55.9%. The prevalence of khat abuse was 41.9%; alcohol use disorder, 36.2%; nicotine dependence, 19.8%; and cannabis use disorder, 3.6%. Poor social support, living in urban areas, psychopathy, and a family history of substance use were positively associated with substance use disorder.
   Conclusions: Substance use disorder is prevalent among prisoners. The increased morbidity and unpleasant psychosocial consequences associated with substance use disorder, together with our finding that 66.3% of prisoners with substance use disorder were interested in obtaining treatment, suggest a need to establish prison-based treatment in this correctional institution in Jimma.

   ILLNESS
AB Background: The aim of the WorkplaceAid study was to compare the effects of eLearning or blended (eLearning plus face-to-face course delivery) Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) courses on public servants' knowledge, stigmatising attitudes, confidence in providing support and intentions to provide support to a person with depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
   Methods: A randomized controlled trial was carried out with 608 Australian public servants. Participants were randomly assigned to complete an eLearning MHFA course, a blended MHFA course or Red Cross eLearning Provide First Aid (PFA) (the control). The effects of the interventions were evaluated using online questionnaires pre-and post-training. The questionnaires centred around vignettes describing a person meeting the criteria for depression or PTSD. Primary outcomes were mental health first aid knowledge and desire for social distance. Secondary outcomes were recognition of mental health problems, beliefs about treatment, helping intentions and confidence and personal stigma. Feedback on the usefulness of the courses was also collected.
   Results: Both the eLearning MHFA and blended MHFA courses had positive effects compared to PFA eLearning on mental health first aid knowledge, desire for social distance, beliefs about professional treatments, intentions and confidence in helping a person and personal stigma towards a person with depression or PTSD. There were very small non-significant differences between the eLearning MHFA and blended MHFA courses on these outcome measures. However, users were more likely to highly rate the blended MHFA course in terms of usefulness, amount learned and intentions to recommend the course to others.
   Conclusions: The blended MHFA course was only minimally more effective than eLearning MHFA in improving knowledge and attitudes. However, course satisfaction ratings were higher from participants in the blended MHFA course, potentially leading to greater benefits in the future. Longer-term follow-up is needed to explore this.

AB Background
   This study evaluated risks of emergency room visit (ERV) for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in 2005-2011, among patients with cardiologic and metabolic syndromes (CMS), in association with ambient environments.
   Methods
   Pooled and area-specific weather related cumulative six-day (lags 0 to 5) relative risks (RRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) of ERV for OHCA were evaluated for CMS cases, using distributed lag nonlinear models and multivariate meta-analytical second-stage model in association with the daily average temperatures and daily concentrations of air pollutants.
   Results
   ERV risk increased as average temperature dropped to <27 degrees C. At the mean temperature of 14 degrees C, the cumulative six-day RRs of ERV were 1.73 (95% CI: 1.22, 2.46) for all OHCA patients, 1.74 (95% CI: 1.06, 2.84) for OHCA patients younger than 65 years old, and 1.99 (95% CI: 1.03, 3.81) for subjects with pre-existing hypertension. High temperature was also associated with elevated ERV of OHCA. Increased ERV risks in cases with pre-existing hypertension and diabetes mellitus were also associated with concentrations of air pollutants in northern Taiwan.
   Conclusions
   Our data provided evidences to clinicians, emerging medical services and public health that the ERV risk for OHCA patients is greater at low temperature than at high temperature. Patients with cardio and metabolic disorders need to pay greater attention to low temperature and avoid heat wave.

TI Modern contraceptive use among reproductive-aged women in Ghana:
   prevalence, predictors, and policy implications
SO BMC WOMENS HEALTH

DT Article
DE Modern contraceptives; Prevalence; Predictors; Reproductive-aged women;
   Ghana
ID FERTILITY
AB Background: Modern contraceptive use remains an important public health intervention and a cost-effective strategy to reduce maternal mortality, avert unintended pregnancies and to control population explosion, especially in developing countries. Despite these benefits, there are reports of low usage among reproductive-aged women in most developing countries. This study examined the prevalence and predictors of use of modern contraceptive among reproductive-aged women in an urban center with a high density population in Ghana.
   Methods: A cross-sectional, interviewer-administered survey was conducted with 217 randomly selected reproductive-aged women. Data was analyzed with STATA. Logistic regression was performed to identify factors influencing modern contraceptive use.
   Results: Although we found high levels of knowledge and awareness (98%; n = 213) of modern contraception use, only 21% of participants were using modern contraceptives. Marital status, partner consent and support, and religious beliefs strongly predicted usage.
   Conclusion: Usage of modern contraceptives among reproductive-aged women in the Ledzokuku Krowor Municipality is lower than the national target. A multilevel family planning intervention program that primarily focuses on promoting inclusive participation of husbands, targets the unmarried and non-literates reproductive-aged women, and dispels misconceptions, misinformation and religious myths about modern contraceptives has been discussed.

TI Prevalence of intestinal parasites versus knowledge, attitude and
   practices (KAPs) with special emphasis to Schistosoma mansoni among
   individuals who have river water contact in Addiremets town, Western
   Tigray, Ethiopia
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   Intestinal parasite infections are major public health problems in resource-limited countries that adversely affect the well-being of millions. Among these, intestinal schistosomiasis is a serious public health problem in tropical and sub-tropical countries.
   Methods
   A Community based cross sectional study was conducted from February to April 2017 in Addiremets town, Ethiopia. Socio-demographic associated risk factors and knowledge, attitude and practices of individuals regarding intestinal parasite infection including schistosomiasis were collected from 411 study participants using pretested structured questionnaires. From each study participant, a fresh stool sample was collected and direct microscopy, formol-ether concentration and Kato-Katz techniques were performed. Snails were checked and collected from the nearby study area river. The collected data was entered and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Bi-variant and multiple logistic regressions were used for correlation analysis. A P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
   Result
   The overall intestinal parasite prevalence was 51.3% (211/411). The most prevalent parasites were S. mansoni 26.3%(108/411) and Hookworm 23.1%(95/411). The prevalence of intestinal parasites among males and females were 54.1%(131/242) and 47.3%(80/169) respectively. The highest proportion of parasite infection was reported among the age group of 5-9 year old participants, at 70.6%(36/51). The prevalence of S. mansoni was 26.3% 108/411) with mean infection intensity of 218 eggs per gram (range: 24 to 1728). Among study participants, 94.4% had good knowledge while 35.9% of them had poor practices towards intestinal parasite and Schistosomes infection prevention.
   Conclusion
   High prevalence of intestinal parasitic infection was observed in Addiremets town and the most common parasites identified were S. mansoni and Hookworm. Most study participants had light infection intensity of Schistosomiasis, Ascariasis and Hookworm infection. Majority of the participants in the study area had good knowledge and positive attitude about intestinal parasitic infection and schistosomiasis control. Shells of Biomphalaria species, Bulinus species and Physa species were collected from the Mytsaeda river shore.

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS; UNITED-STATES; US
   ADULTS; OBESITY; EXERCISE; PSYCHOLOGY; CARDIOLOGY; MORTALITY; ADHERENCE
AB Objective
   We conducted a meta-analysis and systematic review of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the impact of financial incentives (FI) on objectively-measured physical activity (PA) and weight loss (WL) in adults with sedentary behavior or chronic health conditions.
   Evidence review
   We performed a systematic search for RCTs published in English indexed in PubMed, Embase, or Web of Science through July 27, 2017. We limited our search to RCTs that involved an FI intervention with a monetary component, objectively-measured PA or WL outcomes, samples with either sedentary lifestyles or chronic health conditions, and a comparator group that did not receive performance-contingent FI. We calculated the mean difference and standardized mean difference (SMD) for each study and used a random effects model to summarize intervention efficacy. We used the Jadad scoring tool to assess the quality of the identified articles.
   Results
   We abstracted data from 11 RCTs. Two of the 11 included studies focused on PA, totaling 126 intervention and 116 control subjects. Nine RCTs evaluated the effect of FI on WL, totaling 1,799 intervention and 1,483 control subjects. The combined estimate for change in daily steps was 940 (95% CI [306 +/- 1,574]) more in PA intervention groups than in control groups and 2.36 (95% CI [1.80 +/- 2.93]) more kilograms lost by WL intervention groups compared to control groups. The overall estimated SMD for both outcomes combined was 0.395 (95% CI [0.243-0.546; p<0.001]), favoring FI interventions.
   Conclusion
   FI interventions are efficacious in increasing PA and WL in adults with chronic conditions or sedentary adults. Public health programs to increase PA or prevent chronic disease should consider incorporating FI to improve outcomes.

TI Rheumatic heart disease awareness in the South West region of Cameroon:
   A hospital based survey in a Sub-Saharan African setting
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID FEVER; PREVENTION; PREVALENCE
AB Background
   Early diagnosis and adequate treatment of Group A streptococcal throat infection is an important initial stage in the primary prevention of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. This preventable condition associated with high mortality rates mandates a thorough understanding by the general public and the health.
   Objective
   The aim of the study was to assess the level of awareness about different aspects of rheumatic heart disease in patients coming to the outpatient department of the Buea regional Hospital, South West region of Cameroon.
   Methods
   This was a cross-sectional descriptive study carried in the outpatient department of the Buea Regional Hospital, Cameroon. The study population was adults and children aged 9 years and above. Data collection was done by using a self-administered questionnaire addressed to assess awareness on rheumatic heart disease.
   Results
   A total of 256 participants were interviewed, of which 70 (27.3%) were males. Their mean age was 34.4 +/- 11.9 years (males: 36.2 +/- 12.7 years versus females: 33.7 +/- 11.6 years, p = 0.129). Most of the participants were in the 20 to 29 year old group (37.9%). More than two thirds (71.1%) of the participants reported having had sore throat at least once. The disease was treated with antibiotics in only 45.4%, with the treatment prescribed by a health care professional in 35.8% of the cases. About 73% of the respondents did not know what causes sore throat, and most (71.1%) were unaware of any complications that could arise from poorly treated sore throat. More than 70% of the participants did not know that sore throat can be associated with heart disease. Rheumatic heart disease was unknown to 82% of the participants and 95% of them did not know what causes RHD. Only 5.1% percent of the participants had an adequate knowledge of RHD. Age <= 35 years, post-secondary level of education, and having heard of RHD were significantly associated with an adequate knowledge. After adjusting for age, post-secondary education (aOR: 9, [95% C: 1.2 +/- 67.5], p = 0.019), and having heard of RHD (aOR: 18.1, [95% CI: 4.7 +/- 70.3], p<0.001) were still associated with a fair knowledge.
   Conclusions
   Levels of knowledge and awareness on rheumatic heart disease is low. This study provides important insight into the perception and practices related to sore throat that can be used in the design of awareness activities aimed reducing the risk of RHD in Cameroon. The appropriateness of antibiotics prescribed, and the health care provider awareness and knowledge levels regarding RHD in Cameroon has not been reported yet in the literature. This grey area deserves more research.

TI Factors associated with anemia in young children in Brazil
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID IRON-DEFICIENCY; RISK-FACTORS; PREVALENCE; INFECTIONS; HEALTH;
   SUPPLEMENTATION; UNDERNUTRITION; INFANTS
AB Background
   Anemia is recognized as a major public health problem in childhood, especially in children under 24 months of age. Despite improvements in public health strategies to prevent and control anemia in Brazilian young children in the last decade, few studies have assessed the predictors for this condition in primary health care. Thus, this study aimed to assess the associated factors of anemia in young children who visited primary public health care facilities in Brazil.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional study was conducted with 520 children aged 11 to 15 months who visited the primary health care in four Brazilian cities. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin concentration < 110 g/L in venous blood samples. Multilevel Poisson regression models were used to describe the associations between anemia and independent variables.
   Results
   The frequency of anemia was 23.1%. A higher frequency was observed in children who live with more than one other child younger than 5 years in the house (Prevalence Ratio [PR] 1.47; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.01- 2.14), who started to receive fruits and vegetables after 8 months of age (PR 1.92; 95% CI 1.19-3.10), who were stunted (PR 2.44; 95% CI 1.32-4.50), who were hospitalized at least once in their life (PR 1.55; 95% CI 1.03-2.33) and who were in the lower tertile of serum folate concentration (PR 2.24; 95% CI 1.30-3.85).
   Conclusions
   Inadequate complementary feeding practices and morbidity were the main predictors for anemia in early childhood in this population. Improvements in current strategies to promote healthy complementary feeding along with better control of morbidities are recommended to reduce anemia in Brazilian young children.

AB Background: Infectious disease screening of migrants at increased risk is a feature of national infection prevention and control measures. Asylum seekers in Finland are offered screening of tuberculosis (TB), hepatitis B, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) and syphilis based on individual risk assessment. We aimed to evaluate the public health response to a large influx of asylum seekers to Finland in 2015-2016 with respect to national guidelines on initial health services and infectious disease screening.
   Methods: We used immigration and healthcare procurement data for all 38,134 asylum seekers to Finland during 2015-2016 to assess the implementation, timing and yields of infectious disease screening.
   Results: The coverage of pulmonary TB screening was 71.6% [95% CI 71.1-72.0%] and that of hepatitis B, HIV or syphilis 60. 6% [60.1-61.1%] among those eligible for screening. The estimated average delay from arrival to pulmonary TB screening was 74 days for adults and 43 days for children. Delay to hepatitis B, HIV and syphilis screening was 91 days for adults and 47 days for children. The seroprevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen positivity was 1.4% [95% CI 1.3-1.6%], HIV 0.3% [95% CI 0.1-0.4%] and Treponema pallidum specific antibodies 1.0% [95% CI 0.8-1.1%]. Data did not allow assessment of yields of pulmonary TB screening.
   Conclusions: Up to one third of asylum seekers were not reached by screening and screenings were delayed from target timeframes. Children, as a vulnerable population, were screened earlier than adults. To ensure higher screening coverage, infectious disease risks should be reassessed and screening completed at contacts to healthcare during the post-asylum phase of integration. The large influx of asylum seekers to Finland in 2015-2016 tested the country's public health preparedness. After action reviews of the public health response to the large migrant influx such as screening implementation can be used for evidence-based improvement of public health preparedness and guidelines for initial health services and infectious disease screening.

AB Background: Diabetes, a rising global health problem, requires continuous self-care practice to prevent acute and chronic complications. However, studies show that few diabetes patients practice the recommended self-care in Ethiopia. The aim of this study was to assess factors associated with self-care practice among adult diabetes patients in public hospitals of West Shoa Zone, Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 257 diabetes patients (mean age 42.9 +/- 14.6 years, 54.1% male) completed the survey in Afan Oromo and Amharic languages. A questionnaire consisting standardized tools was used to collect the data. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were conducted using SPSS version 21.
   Results: The mean score for diabetes self-care was 39.8 +/- 9.5 and 45.5% of the participants scored below the mean. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that having higher diabetes knowledge (AOR = 2.42, 95% CI = 1.22, 4. 80), self-efficacy (AOR = 3.30, 95% CI = 1.64, 6.62), social support (AOR = 2.86, 95% CI = 1.37, 5.96), secondary school education (AOR = 6.0, 95% CI = 1.90, 18.85), and longer duration of diabetes (AOR = 5.55, 95% CI = 2.29, 13.44) were important predictors of good diabetes self-care practice.
   Conclusion: The diabetes education programs should use strategies that enhance patients' diabetes knowledge, self-efficacy, and social support. Patients with recent diabetes diagnosis need special attention as they may relatively lack knowledge and skills in self-care. Further studies are needed to elucidate pathways through which diabetes knowledge, self-efficacy, social support, and health literacy affect diabetes self-care.

AB Immunochemical fecal occult blood tests (iFOBTs) are increasingly used for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. In our preceding observational study, sensitivity for detecting advanced colorectal neoplasms by iFOBT was 70.8% among users of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid compared with 35.9% among non-users (p = 0.001), whereas there were only very small differences in specificity. In receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses, the area under the curve (AUC) was much higher for acetylsalicylic acid users than for non-users, with particularly strong differences in men (0.87 versus 0.68, p = 0.003). These findings suggested that use of acetylsalicylic acid before conduct of iFOBT might be a promising approach to improve non-invasive screening for CRC.
   Methods/design: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the diagnostic performance of two iFOBTs for detecting advanced colorectal neoplasms after a single low-dose of acetylsalicylic acid (300 mg) compared to placebo is evaluated. Acetylsalicylic acid or placebo is administered at least 5 days before a planned, study-independent colonoscopic screening in 2400 participants aged 40 to 80 years. Stool samples are obtained before and on three different days after the single dose of acetylsalicylic acid or placebo. In addition, optional blood samples are taken for future biomarker analyses. The diagnostic performance of the iFOBTs will be compared to the results of the colonoscopy as a gold standard for the diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms. Additionally, gender-specific performance of the tests and gain in diagnostic performance by test application on multiple days will be evaluated.
   Discussion: If the findings from our preceding observational study will be confirmed in this large trial, the proposed low-risk, inexpensive intervention would considerably improve the diagnostic accuracy of iFOBTs and thus lead to enhanced early detection of colorectal neoplasms. Thus, the results of this trial may have a large public health impact.

AB Background: For decades, various cardiovascular symptoms have been relieved by the use of Ya-Hom Navakot, which is a formulation comprising 54 herbal medicines. The Thailand Ministry of Public Health listed Ya-Hom Navakot's nine active principle and nomenclative herbal ingredients and termed them 'Phikud Navakot' (PN). Several reports have confirmed that PN has cardiovascular benefits similar to Ya-Hom Navakot However, whether PN facilitates lipid-lowering activity remains unclear.
   Methods: The present study investigated an in vitro model for examining the gene expression levels of 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) in HepG2 cells using qRT-PCR. The ethanol and water extractions of Ya-Hom Navakot PN and Ya-Hom Navakot without PN were compared.
   Results: One mg/ml of both NYEF and NYWF were found to significantly lower cholesterol by either the up-regulation of LDL-R or down-regulation of HMGCR compared with negative controls and 1 mg/ml simvastatin (p < 0.05). PNEF also up-regulated LDL-R gene expression, even more than NYEF (p < 0.05). In addition, the ethanol and water extracts of PN significantly down-regulated HMGCR gene expression compared with those of Ya-Hom Navakot without PN (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: The use of Ya-Hom Navakot or PN may provide an alternative treatment to lower cholesterol through HMGCR gene inhibition and LDL-R gene enhancement.

ID BUILDING TYPE; CLASSIFICATION; ENSEMBLE
AB Having accurate maps depicting the locations of residential buildings across a region benefits a range of sectors. This is particularly true for public health programs focused on delivering services at the household level, such as indoor residual spraying with insecticide to help prevent malaria. While open source data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) depicting the locations and shapes of buildings is rapidly improving in terms of quality and completeness globally, even in settings where all buildings have been mapped, information on whether these buildings are residential, commercial or another type is often only available for a small subset. Using OSM building data from Botswana and Swaziland, we identified buildings for which 'type' was indicated, generated via on the ground observations, and classified these into two classes, "sprayable" and "not-sprayable". Ensemble machine learning, using building characteristics such as size, shape and proximity to neighbouring features, was then used to form a model to predict which of these 2 classes every building in these two countries fell into. Results show that an ensemble machine learning approach performed marginally, but statistically, better than the best individual model and that using this ensemble model we were able to correctly classify >86% (using independent test data) of structures correctly as sprayable and not-sprayable across both countries.

AB Kidney stones impose a large and increasing public health burden. Previous studies showed that hyponatremia is associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures, which are also known to be associated with kidney stones. However, the relation between hyponatremia and kidney stones is not known. To assess the relation between hyponatremia and kidney stones, we designed a matched case-control study by using the electronic health records of the MedStar Health system with more than 3.4 million unique patient records as of March 2016. Data were extracted for clinical factors of patients with kidney stones (cases) and those without kidney stones (controls). Cases (n = 20,199) and controls (n = 20,199) were matched at a 1: 1 ratio for age, sex, race, and the duration of encounter window. Case and control exposures for each of the hyponatremia variables were defined by serum sodium laboratory measurements reported within the encounter windows, and divided into 3 categories: prior hyponatremia, recent hyponatremia, and persistent hyponatremia. In the final conditional logistic models adjusted for potential confounders, the risk of kidney stones significantly increased in both recent and persistent hyponatremia categories: prior hyponatremia odds ratio (OR) 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86 +/- 1.00); recent hyponatremia OR 2.02 (95% CI, 1.76 +/- 2.32); persistent hyponatremia OR 6.25 (95% CI, 3.27 +/- 11.96). In conclusion, chronic persistent hyponatremia is a significant and clinically important risk factor for kidney stones in patients in the U.S.

AB Background: Women diagnosed with gynaecological cancer experience supportive care needs that require care provision to reduce the impact on their lives. International evidence suggests supportive care needs of women with gynaecological cancer are not being met and provision of holistic care is a priority area for action. Knowledge on gynaecological cancer supportive care needs is limited, specifically comparison of needs and cancer gynaecological subtype. Our aim was to identify supportive care needs of Western Australian women experiencing gynaecological cancer, their satisfaction with help and explore associations between participant's demographic characteristics and identified needs.
   Methods: A cross-sectional design incorporating a modified version of the Supportive Care Needs Survey - short form (SCNS-SF34) assessed 37 supportive care needs under five domains in conjunction with demographic data. Three hundred and forty three women with gynaecological cancer attending a tertiary public referral hospital completed the survey over 12 months. Statistical analysis was performed using the R environment for statistical computing. A linear regression model was fitted with factor scores for each domain and demographic characteristics as explanatory variables.
   Results: Three hundred and three women (83%) identified at least one moderate or high level supportive care need. The five highest ranked needs were, 'being informed about your test results as soon as feasible' (54.8%), 'fears about cancer spreading' (53.7%), 'being treated like a person not just another case' (51.9%), 'being informed about cancer which is under control or diminishing (that is, remission)' (50.7%), and 'being adequately informed about the benefits and side-effects of treatments before you choose to have them'(49.9%). Eight of the top ten needs were from the 'health system and information' domain. Associations between supportive care items and demographic variables revealed 'cancer type', and 'time since completion of treatment' had no impact on level of perceived need for any domain.
   Conclusions: Western Australian women with gynaecological cancer identified a high level of supportive care needs. The implementation of a supportive care screening tool is recommended to ensure needs are identified and care is patient-centred. Early identification and management of needs may help to reduce the burden on health system resources for managing ongoing needs.

AB Background: There is a considerable prevalence of and an increasing attention to emotional problems in families with infants. Yet, knowledge is scant of how to create efficient and accessible mental health services for this population. The study qualitatively explored public health nurses conceptions of a clinical project, in which psychotherapists provided short-term consultations and supervisions for nurses at Child Health Centres in Stockholm.
   Methods: In-depth interviews with fifteen nurses. The guideline of the interviews contained open-ended questions that were analysed applying a hermeneutical approach.
   Results: Four main themes crystallized; The nurses conceptions of their psychosocial work, Trespassing on another professional role, Interprofessional collaboration at the Child Health Centre, and The nurses' conceptions of the psychotherapist's function. In a second step, an analysis that clustered the nurses attitudes towards handling mental health problems yielded one last theme with three "Ideal types"; nurses who expressed "I don't want to", "I want to but I cannot", and "I want to and I can" (take care of families' emotional problems at the CHC).
   Conclusion: The nurses appreciated the easy referral and accessibility to the psychotherapists, and the possibilities of learning more about perinatal mental illness and parent-infant interactions. For a successful cooperation with the nurses, the therapist should be a team member, be transparent about his/her work, and give feedback about cases in treatment The study also shows how the organization needs to clarify its guidelines and competence to improve psychological child health care. The paper suggests improvements for an integrated perinatal mental health care.

AB This study aimed to investigate whether smokers who are ready to quit are more likely to use electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) than those who are not. The association between the ever and current use of e-cigarettes with the stages of change (SOC) model was examined, which reflects the readiness to quit smoking. Current smokers were categorized based on the SOC (precontemplation, contemplation, and preparation). We investigated the associations between quit attempts, intention to quit, and stage of change with e-cigarette use in the general population and different age groups. We used data from the Korea Community Health Survey that was conducted nationwide in 2014, and 45,378 current smokers were included in the study. Adult smokers were more likely to use e-cigarettes simultaneously in the preparation and contemplation stages than in the precontemplation stage (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] of preparation stage: 2.88 and 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.26-3.66; AOR of contemplation stage: 1.93 and 95% CI: 1.67-2.24). Ever use of e-cigarette was significantly associated with the contemplation stage in smokers younger than 50 years, while current e-cigarette use was greater in the contemplation stage than in the precontemplation stage at all ages. Both ever and current use of e-cigarettes were significantly related with the preparation stage among all age groups except 50-59 years. Because the use of e-cigarette among smokers may continually increase, public health guidance must be provided to different types of dual users. Previous studies on the association between e-cigarette use and the cognitive and behavioral aspects of smokers have conflicting results. This study highlights whether the use of e-cigarettes can be used as an indicator for the readiness to quit smoking. Thus, counselors can encourage smoking cessation and provide tailored interventions.

TI Cancer mortality attributable to cigarette smoking in 2005, 2010 and
   2015 in Qingdao, China
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID LUNG-CANCER; TRENDS; TOBACCO
AB Introduction
   Cigarette smoking is among the most important public health concerns worldwide and the leading preventable cause of illness and death associated with cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although Qingdao, China implemented smoking control measures in 2007 and smoke-free legislation in 2013, smoking-attributable cancer mortality remains at a high level. The present study aimed to facilitate changes in policy-making, intervention implementation, monitoring and evaluation by estimating and comparing the burden of smoking-attributable cancers in Qingdao during 2005, 2010 and 2015.
   Methods
   This study used the disease list from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study to quantify the burden of smoking-related cancer. Sex and age-specific smoking-attributable mortality data were collected from the Qingdao Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention using an online reporting system. The population-attributable fractions (PAFs) of smoking and smoking-attributable cancer mortality in 2005, 2010 and 2015 were estimated using the smoking impact ratio (SIR) and relative risks (RRs) and by multiplying the smoking-attributable fraction by total cancer mortality, respectively.
   Results
   The numbers of smoking-attributable cancer deaths increased from 2484 in 2005 to 2999 in 2010 and 4148 in 2015, with corresponding PAFs of 26.41%, 25.76% and 29.13%, respectively. The PAFs were higher among men (vs. women) for all cancers except cervical cancer. In 2005, lung, liver, esophageal and stomach cancers were most frequently associated with smoking-associated cancer mortality, and lung cancer had the greatest PAF, followed by nasopharyngeal, oral and esophageal cancers. Similar patterns were observed in 2010 and 2015. In 2015, 1 in 3 and 1 in 5 cancer deaths in men and women, respectively, were attributable to smoking, and 95% of these deaths were associated with lung, liver, esophageal or stomach cancer. Over time, downward and upward trends in smoking-attributable cancer deaths were respectively observed among people younger than and older than 50 years.
   Conclusions
   The smoking-attributable cancer burden in Qingdao remains considerable, despite the implementation of tobacco control and smoke-free measures. Tobacco control efforts should remain a major public health priority.

TI HIV prevention: mapping Mozambican people's views on the acceptability
   of the widow's sexual cleansing ritual called pita-kufa
SO BMC INTERNATIONAL HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS
LA English
DT Article
DE HIV; Sexual ritual; Widow cleansing; women's rights
ID WOMEN
AB Background: In Mozambique, the widow is traditionally required to undergo a cleansing ritual called pita-kufa, which generally involves several sessions of unprotected sexual intercourse with the brother of her deceased husband. This ritual may play a role in the spread of HIV and reveals, to some degree, the subordinate position to which women are subjected in Mozambican society. Thus, this study's aim was to map Mozambicans' views on the acceptability of this ritual, given the gender and public health concerns linked to it.
   Methods: A total of 359 Mozambicans participated in the study. The data collection instrument consisted of 18 vignettes describing realistic pita-kufa situations, varying as a function of three factors: a widow's willingness or not to perform the ritual, the perceived effectiveness of the ritual, and the risk level of HIV infection linked to the practice. For each pita-kufa situation presented in the vignettes, the participants were asked to rate its acceptability on an 11-point scale. In addition, the participants wrote comments giving their general views on the ritual. A cluster analysis using the K-means procedure was applied to the quantitative raw data to capture different perspectives, and the participants written comments were subjected to thematic and frequency content analysis.
   Results: From the data gathered though the vignettes, three different perspectives were found: total unacceptability (55% of the participants), conditional acceptability (29% of the participants) and unconditional acceptability (16% of the participants). From the data gathered though the participants' written comments, it emerged that they thought that the practice of this ritual should evolve (61%), stop (27%) and be kept as it is (12%).
   Conclusion: According to the main results, it seems that a large majority of study participants think that this ritual is outdated and needs to evolve in order to minimize the risk of HIV transmission and respect women's rights.

   LESIONS; TRENDS; WOMEN
AB Human papillomaviruses (HPV) infection is now known to be responsible for almost all cervical cancers, and for a substantial fraction of Head and Neck cancers (HNCs). However, comprehensive epidemiological and economic data is lacking in France, especially for rarer potentially HPV-related cancers, which include anal, vulvar and vaginal cancers. Using the national comprehensive database of French public and private hospital information (PMSI), we assessed prevalence and incidence of patients with in-hospital diagnosis for potentially HPV-related cancers in 2013, and estimated costs related to their management over a 3-year period after diagnosis in France. Concerning female genital cancers, 7,597, 1,491 and 748 women were hospitalized for cervical, vulvar and vaginal cancer in 2013, respectively, with 3,120, 522 and 323 of them being new cases. A total of 4,153 patients were hospitalized for anal cancer in 2013, including 1,661 new cases. For HNCs, 8,794 and 14,730 patients were hospitalized for oral and oropharyngeal cancer in 2013, respectively; 3,619 and 6,808 were new cases. Within the 3 years after cancer diagnosis, the average cost of hospital care per patient varied from (sic)28 K for anal cancer to (sic)41 K for oral cancer. Most expenditures were related to hospital care, before outpatient care and disability allowance; they were concentrated in the first year of care. The total economic burden associated with HPV-potentially related cancers was about (sic)511 M for the French National Health Insurance over a 3 years period (2011 to 2013), ranging from (sic)8 M for vaginal cancer to (sic)222 M for oropharyngeal cancer. This study reported the most up-to-date epidemiological and economic data on potentially HPV-related cancers in France. These results may be used to evaluate the potential impact of new preventive strategies, namely the generalized organized screening of cervical cancer and the nine-valent HPV vaccine, indicated in the prevention of cervical, vaginal, vulvar and anal cancers.

TI How do organisational configuration and context influence the quantity

ID MEDICINES USE REVIEWS; HEALTH-CARE; WORKLOAD; UK; OUTCOMES; STRESS;
   IMPACT
AB Community pharmacies are expanding their role into medicines-related healthcare and public health services, previously the domain of physicians and nurses, driven by policies to improve healthcare access for patients and to address problems of increasing demands and rising costs in primary and urgent care services. Understanding the organisational context into which this expansion is taking place is necessary given concerns over the extent to which pharmacies prioritise service volume over the quality of service provision. As part of a larger programme of work, this paper aims to explore stakeholder perceptions of the organisational and extra-organisational factors associated with service quality and quantity in community pharmacy as an established exemplar of private sector organisations providing publicly-funded healthcare. With ethics committee approval, forty semi-structured interviews were conducted with service commissioners, superintendent and front-line pharmacists, purposively selected from across nine geographical areas and a range of community pharmacy organisational types in England. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. Findings highlight the perceived importance of appropriate staffing and skill-mix for promoting service quantity and quality in community pharmacy. Organisational cultures which supported team development were viewed as facilitatory whereas those prioritising business targets over service quality seen to be inhibitive. Older local populations and low patient expectations were thought to limit service uptake as was poor integration with wider primary care services. The contractual framework and commissioning processes were also seen as a barrier to increasing service quality, quantity and integration in this sector. These findings suggest that healthcare administrations should take account of organisational and extra-organisational drivers and barriers when commissioning services from private sector providers such as community pharmacies to ensure that the quality of service provision is incentivised in addition to service quantity. Additionally, collaborative working should be encouraged through integrated commissioning mechanisms.

AB Background
   Partnerships in global health and development governance have been firmly established as a tool to achieve effective outcomes. Botswana implements Safe Male Circumcision (SMC) for HIV prevention through a North-South partnership comprising the local Ministry of Health, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (funded by PEPFAR) and Africa Comprehensive HIV/AIDS Partnership (funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation). The SMC partnership experienced significant antagony and the aim of this paper is to illuminate the actions and processes in the SMC program that contributed to that antagony.
   Methods
   Methods used to gather data include observation of the partners' planning and strategic meeting in 2012, in-depth interviews with lead officers at national level, focus group discussions with district officers and implementers, younger male officers and old community members as recipients of the service.
   Results
   The findings reveal that the partnership experienced antagony during operational processes and as the ultimate outcome. Target setting, financial power of the North, superficial ownership given to the South, ignoring local traditional realities results in antagony. Three roots of antagony have been identified: 1. therapeutic domination - medical expertise given with arrogance; 2. iatrogenic violence - good intentions that cause unintended harm; 3. the Trojan horse - Reckless acceptance of the gift as well as deceptive power positioned under the pretext of benevolence.
   Conclusion
   The three roots of antagony; therapeutic domination, iatrogenic violence and the Trojan horse, constitute attitudes, hidden intentions and unintended consequences that influence program implementation and cause harm at different levels. Examples of therapeutic domination and the Trojan horse have highlighted the need for vigilance at the stage of establishing a partnership, to prevent more powerful partners from developing and applying hidden agendas and to strengthen accountability from the local partner. Iatrogenic violence has highlighted the need for partnership interventions to prevent good partner intentions accidentally producing bad outcomes.

AB Anisakis simplex spp. sensitization rates have increased worldwide, with a significant impact on health-care systems. To date, no clear-cut diagnostic criteria and laboratory algorithm have been established, so anisakiasis still represents an under-reported health problem whose clinical manifestations, when present, mimic the much more common allergic and digestive disorders. Aim of the study was to systematically review the available literature on the prevalence of sensitization against Anisakis in the general population and in specific population groups, taking into account the impact of the different available diagnostic techniques on the epidemiological data. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, relevant papers reporting Anisakis sensitization epidemiological data were found covering a period ranging from 1996 to February 2017. Overall, 41 studies comprising 31,701 participants from eleven countries were included in the qualitative synthesis. General asymptomatic population resulted sensitized to Anisakis in 0.4 to 27.4% of cases detected by means of indirect ELISA or ImmunoCAP specific IgE detection, and between 6.6% and 19.6% of the samples by Skin prick test (SPT). Occupationally exposed workers (fishermen, fishmongers and workers of fish-processing industries) documented specific IgE between 11.7% and 50% of cases, whereas SPT positivity ranged between 8% and 46.4%. Symptomatic allergic patients to any kind of allergen were found to be positive to Anisakis specific IgE detection between 0.0% (in children with mastocytosis) to 81.3% (among adults with shellfish allergy). Results highlighted that hypersensitivity prevalence estimates varied widely according to geographical area, characteristics of the population studied, diagnostic criteria and laboratory assays. Further studies are needed to overcome the documented misdiagnosis by improving the diagnostic approach and, consequently, providing more affordable estimates in order to address public health interventions on populations at high risk of exposure to Anisakis and to tailor health services related to specific groups.

TI Impact of cigarette taxes on smoking prevalence from 2001-2015: A report
   using the Behavioral and Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS)
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID YOUTH SMOKING; UNITED-STATES; YOUNG-ADULTS; CONSUMPTION; EXCISE; PRICES
AB Objectives
   To provide an up-to-date analysis on the relationship between excise taxes and the prevalence of cigarette smoking in the United States.
   Methods
   Linear mixed-effects models were used to model the relationship between excise taxes and prevalence of cigarette smoking in each state from 2001 through 2015.
   Results
   From 2001 through 2015, increases in state-level excise taxes were associated with declines in prevalence of cigarette smoking. The effect was strongest in young adults (age 18-24) and weakest in low-income individuals (<$25,000).
   Conclusions
   Despite the shrinking pool of current smokers, excise taxes remain a valuable tool in public-health efforts to reduce the prevalence of cigarette smoking.
   Policy implications
   States with high smoking prevalence may find increased excise taxes an effective measure to reduce population smoking prevalence. Since the effect is greatest in young adults, benefits of increased tax would likely accumulate over time by preventing new smokers in the pivotal young-adult years.

AB Background: Although research has explored influenza vaccination uptake among medical and college students, there is a dearth of research in understanding influenza vaccination uptake and attitudes toward the vaccine among future public health practitioners. Undergraduate public health students represent future public health practitioners who may be a significant educational resource for health information, including the importance of vaccinations.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study utilized survey data from 158 undergraduate public health students attending a large public university in Southern California. The survey assessed public health students' attitudes and beliefs towards the seasonal influenza vaccine and seasonal vaccination rates among this population.
   Results: Over 88% of respondents reported having been encouraged to receive the seasonal influenza vaccine, while only 43.0% reported receipt. Of the students who reported not receiving the vaccine, 49.4% believed it may give them the flu, 30.4% believed there may be dangerous side effects, and 28.9% believed they were not at risk for contracting the flu. Access to health care practitioners (OR: 3.947, 95% CI [1.308-11.906]) and social encouragement (OR: 3.139, 95% CI [1.447-6.811]) were significantly associated with receipt of the seasonal influenza vaccine.
   Conclusion: As public health program curriculum includes information about seasonal influenza vaccination and 68% of the sample were seniors soon to be exiting the program with an undergraduate degree in public health education, this low seasonal influenza vaccination rate is disturbing. This study may add to the body of data demonstrating how knowledge of the vaccine does not always guarantee vaccine uptake. Results of the current study suggest that it may be beneficial to provide additional information targeted to public health students, aimed at mediating safety concerns and increasing social pressure to assist in improving vaccine acceptance and rates in this population. Maximizing seasonal influenza vaccination uptake by addressing attitudes, barriers and misperceptions may not only improve vaccination rates among public health students, but also in communities served by these future public health practitioners.

AB Background: Bronchiectasis is a worsening public health problem in New Zealand. This study aimed to explore the health care experiences of mothers of children with bronchiectasis in the Counties Manukau District Health Board area of Auckland, New Zealand.
   Methods: Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with ten mothers of children with bronchiectasis. Data were analysed using thematic analysis.
   Results: Five themes emerged: 1) Searching for answers, describing mothers' search for a diagnosis; 2) (Dis) empowerment, describing mothers' acquisition of knowledge, leading to empowerment 3) Health care and relationships, describing the impact of relationships on the mother's health care experiences; 4) A juggling act, describing the challenges of juggling health care with school, work and family; 5) Making it work, describing how mothers overcome barriers to access health care for their child.
   Conclusions: The health provider-parent relationship was crucial for fostering positive health care experiences.Mothers' acquisition of knowledge facilitated empowerment within those relationships. Additionally, mothers' perceptions of the quality and benefit of health services motivated them to overcome barriers to accessing care. Study findings may help to improve health care experiences for parents of children with bronchiectasis if identified issues are addressed.

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT; OF-CARE; PERFORMANCE
AB Ensuring quality of care in nursing homes is a public health priority, yet how nursing home quality relates to cost is not well understood. This paper addresses this relationship for 132 VA community living centers (nursing homes), for fiscal years 2014 and 2015. We estimated cost models using the VA Decision Support System which tracks total direct costs and nursing direct costs for individual resident segments of care. We summed residents' total costs and nursing costs to the community living center level for each year. Annual facility costs then were regressed on quality of care measured with composite scores based on 13 distinct adverse events. Results indicated that higher quality was associated with higher predicted cost. However, we did not find evidence that higher costs were driven by high nurse staffing levels.

TI Use of scientific evidence by dentists in Brazil: Room for improving the
   evidence-based practice
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID DENTAL PRACTITIONERS; ORAL-HEALTH
AB This study investigated the use of scientific evidence and the practice of evidence-based dentistry (EBD) among dentists working in Brazil. An online questionnaire was emailed to dentists registered with Brazilian state dental councils. The questionnaire assessed the demographic, educational, and work characteristics of the sample, along with habits in reading scientific articles and other updating resources. Data were analyzed descriptively and by using Bonferroni, Kruskal-Wallis, ANOVA, and T-test statistical methods (a = 0.05). A total of 795 responses were received between June, 2015 and January, 2016. The response rate was not calculated because it was not possible to determine precisely how many dentists received these e-mails. Over 77% of the responding dentists completed postgraduate training. They referred mainly to books, scientific or clinical journals, conferences, and shortterm courses for updating their knowledge. Dentists who reported having a habit of reading scientific journals (60.9%) showed a preference for reading case reports, clinical research articles, and literature reviews. Most dentists (77.5%) reported changing their clinical behaviors or procedures based on information gleaned from journal articles. The types of articles that led them to change their clinical practices were primarily clinical research articles and case reports. Working in the public sector was also associated with a lower prevalence of a habit of reading scientific journals and practicing EBD (i.e., self-reported practice). The results suggest that dentists are interested in reading journal articles, especially those addressing clinical outcomes, and that there is room for improving the practice of EBD, particularly in the public sector.

AB Background and purpose
   A multi-country European study using data from six healthcare databases from four countries was performed to evaluate in a large study population (>32 million) the risk of ischemic stroke (IS) associated with individual NSAIDs and to assess the impact of risk factors of IS and co-medication.
   Methods
   Case-control study nested in a cohort of new NSAID users. For each case, up to 100 sexand age-matched controls were selected and confounder-adjusted odds ratios for current use of individual NSAIDs compared to past use calculated.
   Results
   49,170 cases of IS were observed among 4,593,778 new NSAID users. Use of coxibs (odds ratio 1.08, 95%-confidence interval 1.02 +/- 1.15) and use of traditional NSAIDs (1.16, 1.12 +/- 1.19) were associated with an increased risk of IS. Among 32 individual NSAIDs evaluated, the highest significant risk of IS was observed for ketorolac (1.46, 1.19 +/- 1.78), but significantly increased risks (in decreasing order) were also found for diclofenac, indomethacin, rofecoxib, ibuprofen, nimesulide, diclofenac with misoprostol, and piroxicam. IS risk associated with NSAID use was generally higher in persons of younger age, males, and those with a prior history of IS.
   Conclusions
   Risk of IS differs between individual NSAIDs and appears to be higher in patients with a prior history of IS or transient ischemic attack (TIA), in younger or male patients. Co-medication with aspirin, other antiplatelets or anticoagulants might mitigate this risk. The small to moderate observed risk increase (by 13-46%) associated with NSAIDs use represents a public health concern due to widespread NSAID usage.

AB Polypharmacy is associated with adverse drug reactions and represents an economic burden on the health insurance system. The objective of our study was to assess the trends in polypharmacy and its associated factors in South Korea. This cross-sectional study used a nationwide sampled database between 2002 and 2013, including outpatients of all ages who received at least 1 prescription in the same period. Polypharmacy was defined as the concomitant prescription of >= 6 distinct medications on a single prescription at least once without a given duration. The yearly prescribing trends were calculated and plotted. We conducted comparative analyses to identify the changes in social gradients of polypharmacy between the first 2 years, 2002-2003, and the final 2 years, 2012-2013. We repeated logistic regressions for pediatrics <20 years of age and adults >= 20 years of age to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The distributions of polypharmacy in the respective periods were examined according to patient economic status (0 = most deprived and 10 = most affluent). The age-standardized prevalence of polypharmacy decreased from 65.8% in 2002 to 43.7% in 2013. Our study included 1,108,298 outpatients throughout 2002-2013. Pediatric patients aged 1-9 years had the highest number of medications among all age groups (mean: 5.1 +/- 1.1 in 2002-2003 vs. 4.1 +/- 1.1 in 2012-2013) in both periods. Changes in the association between deprivation and polypharmacy over 10 years were observed in adults (aOR = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.62-0.75 in 2002-2003 vs. 1.60; 95% CI = 1.54-1.66 in 2012-2013) and pediatrics (aOR = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.52-0.68 in 2002-2003 vs. 1.07; 95% CI = 1.01-1.14 in 2012-2013) compared with those in the most affluent patients. The high level of polypharmacy in pediatric patients is a public health concern that warrants policymaker attention.

AB Background
   People with HIV infection in the United States are often affected by chronic viral hepatitis. These coinfected people with either HBV or HCV are at increased risk for serious, life-threatening complications. Coinfections with viral hepatitis may also complicate the delivery of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) by escalating the risk of drug-related hepatoxicity. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 10 percent of people with HIV in the United States also have HBV, and 25 percent also have HCV coinfection. With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and the increased life-expectancy of HIV patients, clinicians are more likely to be confronted with issues related to coinfection and the management challenges that they present, especially in resource-limited settings. The purpose of this analysis was to identify geographical clusters of HIV-(HBV/HCV) co-infection and compared to the geographical clusters of not co-infected using DC, Department of Health surveillance data. The results of the analysis will be used to target resources to areas at risk.
   Methods
   HIV and Hepatitis surveillance data were matched among cases diagnosed between 1980 and 2016. HIV-hepatitis co-infected and the not co-infected spatial clusters were detected using discrete Poisson model. Kulldorff's spatial scan statistic method was implemented in the free software tool called SaTScan which has been widely adopted for detecting disease cluster. The analysis was conducted by tracts, but for visualization, ease of interpretation and assist in policy making the tract map was overlaid with the ward map using ArcGIS 10.5.1.
   Results
   Between 1980 and 2016, there were 12,965 diagnosed cases of HIV, of which 2,316 HIV/Hepatitis matches were identified. Of the 2316 co-infected people living in DC, 25 percent (N = 590) of people had HBV, and 75 percent (N = 1,726) had HCV. Out of 12,965 diagnosed cases, remaining 10,649 did not have any co-infections (not co-infected). IDU (27.16 percent) and MSM (32.86 percent) were the highest mode of transmission for co-infected population. African-American were reported 83.64 percent (N = 1,937) among co-infection population. Three clusters were identified for both co-infected population in DC. The largest cluster radius for co-infected analysis covers wards 6, 7 and 8 as well as large parts of 2 and 5 (p < 0.001). Multiple clusters were identified for not co-infected population (p < 0.001). IDU (n = 450) was the highest mode of transmission for the co-infected clusters. For all clusters combined of not co-infected population highest mode of transmission were MSM (n = 2,534). This analysis also showed racial disparity, economic deprivation and lack of education were prominent in the co-infected clusters.
   Conclusion
   We identified locations of high risk clusters where enhanced hepatitis and HIV prevention, treatment, and care can help combat the epidemic. The clusters radius expands into the neighboring state of Maryland as well. The findings from this analysis will be used to target area based public health policy and healthcare interventions for HIV-hepatitis. It is recommended based on the analysis that needle exchange programs can successfully control new HIV infections as well as hepatitis co-infections.

AB Background: Current research into alcohol consumption focuses predominantly on problematic drinkers and populations considered likely to engage in risky behaviours. Middle-aged drinkers are an under-researched group, despite emerging evidence that their regular drinking patterns may carry some risk.
   Methods: We searched Scopus, Ovid Medline, and Ovid PsycInfo for peer-reviewed, English-language publications appearing prior to 31 December 2015 and relating to the construction of alcohol consumption by middle-aged non-problematised drinkers. Thirteen papers were included in our thematic analysis.
   Results: Middle-aged non-problematised drinkers constructed their drinking practices by creating a narrative of normative drinking via discourses of gender, identity, play, and learning to drink. They also used drinking norms to construct their gender and identity. Health was not identified as a significant consideration for the population of interest when constructing alcohol consumption, except where drinking behaviours were likely to harm another.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that public health campaigns aimed at reducing alcohol consumption may be more effective if they focus on unacceptable drinking behaviours instead of personal health outcomes.

AB Infectious diseases contribute a substantial burden of ill-health in Australia's Aboriginal children. Skin infections have been shown to be common in remote Aboriginal communities, particularly in the Northern Territory, Australia. However, primary care data on skin and other infectious diseases among Aboriginal children living in remote areas of Western Australia are limited. We conducted a retrospective review of clinic presentations of all children aged 0 to 5 years presenting to four clinics located in the Western Desert region of Western Australia between 2007 and 2012 to determine this burden at a local level. Infectious diseases accounted for almost 50% of all clinic presentations. Skin infections (sores, scabies and fungal infections) were the largest proportion (16%), with ear infections (15%) and upper respiratory infections (13%) also high. Skin infections remained high in all age groups; 72% of children presented at least once with skin infections. Scabies accounted for only 2% of all presentations, although one-quarter of children presented during the study for management of scabies. Skin sores accounted for 75% of the overall burden of skin infections. Improved public health measures targeting bacterial skin infections are needed to reduce this high burden of skin infections in Western Australia.

AB Background: Rabies is a major zoonotic disease affecting humans, domestic and wildlife mammals. Cattle are the most important domestic animals impacted by rabies virus in the New World, leading to thousands of cattle deaths per year and eliciting large economic losses. In the New World, virus transmission in cattle is primarily associated with Desmodus rotundus, the common vampire bat. This study analyses the association of weather fluctuations and the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), with the occurrence and magnitude, in terms of associated mortality, of cattle rabies outbreaks. Data from the 100 cattle rabies outbreaks recorded between 1985 and 2016 in Costa Rica were analyzed. Periodograms for time series of rabies outbreaks and the El Nino 4 index were estimated. Seasonality was studied using a seasonal boxplot The association between epidemiological and climatic time series was studied via cross wavelet coherence analysis. Retrospective space-time scan cluster analyses were also performed. Finally, seasonal autoregressive time series models were fitted to study linear associations between monthly number of outbreaks, monthly mortality rates and the El Nino 4 index, temperature, and rainfall.
   Results: Large rabies mortality occurred towards the Atlantic basin of the country. Outbreak occurrence and size were not directly associated with ENSO, but were sensitive to weather variables impacted by ENSO. Both, ENSO phases and rabies outbreaks, showed a similar 5 year period in their oscillations. Cattle rabies mortality and outbreak occurrence increased with temperature, whereas outbreak occurrence decreased with rainfall. These results suggest that special weather conditions might favor the occurrence of cattle rabies outbreaks.
   Conclusions: Further efforts are necessary to articulate the mechanisms underpinning the association between weather changes and cattle rabies outbreaks. One hypothesis is that exacerbation of cattle rabies outbreaks might be mediated by impacts of weather conditions on common vampire bat movement and access to food resources on its natural habitats. Further eco-epidemiological field studies could help to understand rabies virus transmission ecology, and to propose sound interventions to control this major veterinary public health problem.

AB Background: Driving is related to social participation; therefore older drivers may be reluctant to cease driving. Continuation of driving has also been reported in a large proportion of patients with cognitive impairment. The aim of this study is to investigate whether patients with cognitive impairment adhere to driving cessation advice after a fitness-to-drive assessment and what the consequences are with regard to mobility.
   Methods: Patients with cognitive impairment (n = 172) participated in a fitness-to-drive assessment study, including an on-road driving assessment. Afterwards, patients were advised to either continue driving, to follow driving lessons, or to cease driving. Approximately seven months thereafter, patients were asked in a follow-up interview about their adherence to the driving recommendation. Factors influencing driving cessation were identified using a binary logistic regression analysis. Use of alternative transportation was also evaluated.
   Results: Respectively 92 and 79% of the patients adhered to the recommendation to continue or cease driving. Female gender, a higher Clinical Dementia Rating-score, perceived health decline, and driving cessation advice facilitated driving cessation. Patients who ceased driving made use of less alternative modes of transportation than patients who still drove. Nonetheless, around 40% of the patients who ceased driving increased their frequency of cycling and/or public transport use.
   Conclusions: Adherence to the recommendations given after the fitness-to-drive assessments was high. Female patients were in general more likely to cease driving. However, a minority of patients did not adhere to driving cessation advice. These drivers with dementia should be made aware of the progression of their cognitive impairment and general health decline to facilitate driving cessation. There are large differences in mobility between patients with cognitive impairment. Physicians should discuss options for alternative transportation in order to promote sustained safe mobility of patients with cognitive impairment.

AB Background: Mexican law permits syringe purchase and possession without prescription. Nonetheless, people who inject drugs (PWID) frequently report arrest for syringe possession. Extrajudicial arrests not only violate human rights, but also significantly increase the risk of blood-borne infection transmission and other health harms among PWID and police personnel. To better understand how police practices contribute to the PWID risk environment, prior research has primarily examined drug user perspectives and experiences. This study focuses on municipal police officers (MPOs) in Tijuana, Mexico to identify factors associated with self-reported arrests for syringe possession.
   Methods: Participants were active police officers aged >= 18years, who completed a self-administered questionnaire on knowledge, attitudes and behaviors related to occupational safety, drug laws, and harm reduction strategies. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to identify correlates of recent syringe possession arrest.
   Results: Among 1044 MPOs, nearly half (47.9%) reported always/sometimes making arrests for syringe possession (previous 6mo). Factors independently associated with more frequent arrest included being male (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 1.62; 95% Confidence Interval [95% CI] =1.04-2.52; working in a district along Tijuana River Canal (where PWID congregate) (AOR = 2.85; 95%CI = 2.16-3.77); having recently experienced a physical altercation with PWID (AOR = 2.83; 95% CI = 2.15-3.74); and having recently referred PWID to social and health services (AOR = 1.97; 95% CI = 1.48-2.61). Conversely, odds were significantly lower among officers reporting knowing that syringe possession is legal (AOR = 0.61; 95% CI = 0.46-0.82).
   Conclusions: Police and related criminal justice stakeholders (e.g., municipal judges, prosecutors) play a key role in shaping PWID risk environment Findings highlight the urgent need for structural interventions to reduce extra-judicial syringe possession arrests. Police training, increasing gender and other forms of diversity, and policy reforms at various governmental and institutional levels are necessary to reduce police occupational risks, improve knowledge of drug laws, and facilitate harm reduction strategies that promote human rights and community health.

AB Background: Provision of evidence-based smoking cessation treatment may contribute to health disparities if barriers to treatment are greater for more disadvantaged groups. We describe and evaluate the public health impact of a novel outreach program to improve access to smoking cessation treatment in Ontario, Canada.
   Methods: We partnered with Public Health Units (PHUs) located across the province to deliver single-session workshops providing standardized evidence-based content and 10 weeks (2007-2008) or 5 weeks (2008-2016) of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Participants completed a baseline assessment and were followed up by phone or e-mail at 6 months. We used the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance) framework to evaluate the public health impact of the program from 2007 to 2016. Given the iterative design and changes in implementation over time, data is presented annually or bi-annually.
   Results: There were 26,122 enrollments from 2007 to 2016. Between 31 and 442 workshops were held annually. The annual reach was estimated to be 0.1-0.3% of eligible smokers in Ontario. Participants were older, smoked more heavily, had a lower household income, were more likely to be female and be diagnosed with a mood or anxiety disorder, and less likely to have a postsecondary degree compared to average Ontario smokers eligible for participation. The intervention was effective; at 6-month follow-up 22-33% of respondents reported abstinence from smoking. Adoption by PHUs was 81% by the second year of operation and remained high (72-97%) thereafter, with the exception of 2009-2010 (33-56%) when the program was temporarily unavailable to PHUs due to lack of funding. Implementation at the organizational level was not tracked; however, at the individual level, approximately half of participants used most or all of the NRT received. On average, maintenance of the program was high, with PHUs conducting workshops for 7 of the 10 years (2007-2016) and 4 of the 5 most recent years (2012-2016).
   Conclusions: The smoking cessation program had a high rate of adoption and maintenance, reached smokers over a large geographic area, including individuals more likely to experience disparities, and helped them make successful quit attempts. This novel model can be adopted in other jurisdictions with limited resources.

AB Bats play key ecological roles, also hosting many zoonotic pathogens. Neotropical bat microbiota is still poorly known. We speculate that their dietary habits strongly influence their microbiota richness and antibiotic-resistance patterns, which represent growing and serious public health and environmental issue. Here we describe the aerobic microbiota richness of bats from an Atlantic Forest remnant in Southeastern Brazil, and the antibiotic-resistance patterns of bacteria of clinical importance. Oral and rectal cavities of 113 bats from Carlos Botelho State Park were swabbed. Samples were plated on 5% sheep blood and MacConkey agar and identified by the MALDI-TOF technique. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed using Kirby-Bauer's antibiotic disc diffusion technique.We identified 596 isolates at the genus level and tentatively to the species level. Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in all the dietary guilds, representing 87% of the total identified samples. The most common bacteria within bat individuals were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca and Serratia marcescens, and within bat species were Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas sp. and Staphylococcus sp. Frugivores presented the most diverse microbiota. In general, the antibiogram results indicated a low occurrence of resistance on eigth potentially pathogenic bacteria species. The resistance to antibiotics found on our samples was related mostly to the intrinsic resistance of the tested species.The low occurrence of resistant bacteria in our samples could be related to the well preserved environment where bats were caught. Once the major causes of resistance-acquiring are related to anthropic activites, the controlled access of tourists on certain regions of the Park seems to be effectively protecting the environment.

TI Feasibility of school-based health education intervention to improve the
   compliance to mass drug administration for lymphatic Filariasis in
   Lalitpur district, Nepal: A mixed methods among students, teachers and
   health program manager
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ELIMINATION; PREVENTION; PROMOTION; CAMPAIGN; CHILDREN
AB Background
   Ensuring reduction in transmission of lymphatic Filariasis (LF) and addressing the compliance of people to mass drug administration (MDA) has led to renewed efforts in the field. School-based health education (SBHE) intervention, considered a cost-effective strategy with potential to reach the wider public through young people, was adopted as a strategy for social mobilization. This study assessed SBHE perceptions, implementation barriers, and factors in the supporting environment as well as its efficiency to successfully change LF MDA-related knowledge and practice.
   Methods
   This mixed methods study was conducted in four sites of Lalitpur district, Nepal. Classroom-based interactive health education sessions were used as the main intervention strategy in the study. In total, 572 students were assigned to intervention and control groups. Questionnaires were distributed before and after the intervention. Mann-Whitney and McNemar tests were used for analysis. Focus-group discussions with teachers and students and in-depth interviews with the district LF program manager as well as Education Office and school management authorities were conducted. Qualitative thematic analysis approach was adopted.
   Results
   Intervention curriculum played a significant role in increasing children's knowledge and practice (p<0.001). Barriers for school-based interventions were budget constraints, human resource deficiencies, lack of opportunities to conduct practical classes under the curriculum, and lack of collaboration with parents. Supportive factors were training provision, monitoring and evaluation practice, adequate facilities and equipment, positive parental attitudes, presence of interested teachers and students, and prioritization by program implementers.
   Conclusion
   Effective program planning practices such as proper fiscal management, human resource management, training mechanisms, and efforts to promote practical classes and coordination with parents are required to develop and institutionalize the intervention. Effective learning and a supportive school environment appear to be important components to support implementation. The SBHE intervention is a feasible and promising intervention for accelerating compliance towards MDA to eliminate LF.

AB Background: Conventional phylogenetic clustering approaches rely on arbitrary cutpoints applied a posteriori to phylogenetic estimates. Although in practice, Bayesian and bootstrap-based clustering tend to lead to similar estimates, they often produce conflicting measures of confidence in clusters. The current study proposes a new Bayesian phylogenetic clustering algorithm, which we refer to as DM-PhyClus (Dirichlet-Multinomial Phylogenetic Clustering), that identifies sets of sequences resulting from quick transmission chains, thus yielding easily-interpretable clusters, without using any ad hoc distance or confidence requirement.
   Results: Simulations reveal that DM-PhyClus can outperform conventional clustering methods, as well as the Gap procedure, a pure distance-based algorithm, in terms of mean cluster recovery. We apply DM-PhyClus to a sample of real HIV-1 sequences, producing a set of clusters whose inference is in line with the conclusions of a previous thorough analysis.
   Conclusions: DM-PhyClus, by eliminating the need for cutpoints and producing sensible inference for cluster configurations, can facilitate transmission cluster detection. Future efforts to reduce incidence of infectious diseases, like HIV-1, will need reliable estimates of transmission clusters. It follows that algorithms like DM-PhyClus could serve to better inform public health strategies.

AB Background
   HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has likely contributed to large decreases in HIV incidence among men who have sex with men (MSM) in several major cities. Berlin has seen a smaller decline, and affordable PrEP has been accessible through formal channels in Germany only since autumn 2017. We aimed to investigate knowledge and use of PrEP among MSM in Berlin, and factors predictive of a desire to use PrEP and history of PrEP use.
   Methods
   Multicentre, paper-based, self-administered survey of adult MSM whose HIV status was negative or unknown at time of participation. Data were collected from 1 October 2017 to 2 April 2018.
   Results
   473 of 875 questionnaires were returned (response rate 54.1%; mean age 37.4 years, range 18-79). 90.0% of participants were aware of PrEP and, of these, 48.2% felt well informed about it. Among the 17.2% of participants reporting PrEP use, 59.3% indicated obtaining some or all of it from informal sources. 23.7% of those with no history of PrEP use reported having condomless anal intercourse (CAI) with two or more partners over the past six months. Worries about side effects, cost, not having a doctor who prescribes it, and a lack of information were the most frequently reported barriers to PrEP use. A desire to use PrEP and history of PrEP use were associated in our multivariable model with having multiple CAI partners. A history of PrEP use was associated with having a university degree, one or two parents born outside Germany, or friends living with HIV.
   Conclusions
   We found high awareness of PrEP among MSM in Berlin, but also a strong need for more education on its pros, cons and proper use. The frequency of informal PrEP use was also high, raising urgent individual and public health concerns. Policy makers need to consider recent calls to improve access to PrEP and PrEP education through regular health services.

AB Aim
   To investigate whether items of the SF-12, widely used to assess health outcome in clinical practice and public health research, provide unbiased measurements of underlying constructs in different demographic groups regarding gender, age, educational level and ethnicity.
   Methods
   We included 23,146 men and women aged 18-70 of Dutch, South-Asian Surinamese, African Surinamese, Ghanaian, Turkish, or Moroccan origin from the HELIUS study. Both multiple group confirmatory factor analyses (MGCF-A), with increasingly stringent model constraints (i.e. assessing Configural, Metric, Strong and Strict measurement invariance (MI)), and regression analysis were conducted to establish comparability of SF-12 items across demographic groups.
   Results
   MI regarding gender, age and education was tested in the ethnic Dutch group (N = 4,615). In each subsequent step of testing MI, change in goodness-of-fit measures did not exceed 0.010 (RMSEA) or 0.004 (CFI). Moreover, goodness-of-fit indices showed good fit for strict invariance models: RMSEA<0.055; CFI>0.97. Regarding ethnicity, RMSEA values of metric and subsequent models fell above 0.055, indicating violation of measurement invariance in factor loadings, thresholds and residual variances. Regression analysis revealed possible age-, education- and ethnicity-related DIF. Adjustment for this DIF had little impact on the magnitude of age and educational differences in physical and mental health, but ethnic inequalities in physical health-and to a lesser extent mental health D were reduced after DIF adjustment.
   Conclusions
   We found no evidence of violation of measurement invariance of the SF-12 regarding gender, age and educational level. If minor DIF would remain undetected in our MGCFA analyses, we showed that this would have negligible effect on the magnitude of demographic health inequalities. Regarding ethnicity, the SF-12 was not measurement invariant. After accounting for DIF, we observed a reduction of ethnic inequalities in health, in particular in physical health. Caution is warranted when comparing SF-12 scores across population groups with various ethnic backgrounds.

TI Psychometric evaluation of the Family Focused Mental Health Practice
   Questionnaire in measuring home visitors' family focused practice
SO PLOS ONE

   PREVALENCE; DISORDERS; OUTCOMES; ILLNESS
AB Background
   Worldwide maternal mental illness poses a major public health issue. Supporting maternal mental health and family health is a core aspect of home visiting. Increasingly the benefits of family focused treatments to maternal mental illness are being recognised. However, there are few reliable and valid measures that attempt to assess this type of practice.
   Objectives
   To explore the psychometric properties of the Family Focused Mental Health Practice Questionnaire in a population of home visitors.
   Methods
   Home visitors (n = 230) from across a single region of the United Kingdom completed the Family Focused Mental Health Practice Questionnaire. Participants were all females, had a mean age of 44 years, and had an average of 11 years' experience of home visiting. Exploratory factor analysis was used to explore the factor structure of the questionnaire in this population while Cronbach's alpha was used to assess the internal consistency of questionnaire subscales.
   Results
   Exploratory factor analysis revealed a 3-factor solution where each factor contained at least three questionnaire items and had eigenvalues >= 1.0. Checks for internal consistency revealed that one factor was unsatisfactory (alpha < 0.6), which was subsequently discarded. A further exploratory factor analysis supported a 2 factor solution. The factors were named: professional influences on family focused practice and organisational influences on family focused practice. Cronbach's alpha for the new scale was 0.949.
   Conclusion
   As home visitors play a key role in supporting parents who have mental illness and their families, it is important to assess their practice using a reliable measure. Our psychometric evaluation has created a more valid, reliable and concise measure that can be used to examine home visitors' family focused practice.

TI The prevalence and associated factors of non-communicable disease risk
   factors among civil servants in Ibadan, Nigeria
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; SEDENTARY TIME; ADULTS;
   POPULATION; CHINA
AB Background
   Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have become a global public health problem, which threatens Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA) including Nigeria. Civil servants are at risk of NCDs because of the stressful and sedentary nature of their work. The study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of the major risk factors of NCDs among civil servants in Ibadan, Nigeria.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional study was conducted among 606 civil servants in Oyo State using a two-stage cluster sampling technique. The WHO Stepwise approach was used to assess the behavioural and metabolic risk factors. Anthropometric (weight, height, waist and hip circumferences), blood pressure and biochemical measurements (fasting blood sugar) were obtained. Prevalence rates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Multivariate logistic models with adjusted odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were used to assess the associated factors of NCD risk factors. Multiple Poisson regression was also performed to determine the effects of certain socio-demographic factors on the clustering of NCD risk factors.
   Results
   The mean age of the civil servants was 43.0 +/- 10.3 and 53.8% were males. The prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals of the risk factors were 6.5% (95% CI: 4.5-8.5) for current smoking, 7.8% (95% CI: 5.1-10.5) for harmful use of alcohol, 62.2% (95% CI: 58.2-66.2) for low physical activity, 69.7% (95% CI: 66.0-73.4) for insufficient fruit and vegetable intake, 37.1% (95% CI: 33.2-41.0) for abdominal obesity, 57.3% (95% CI: 53.3-61.3) for overweight and obesity, 33.1% (95% CI: 29.3-36.8) for raised blood pressure and 7.1% (95% CI: 5.0-9.1) for raised blood sugar. Over 75% of the population had at least two NCD risk factors and the study participants had an average of 3 NCD risk factors 3.01 (95% CI: 2.88-3.14) The female gender was significantly associated with an increased risk for abdominal obesity (AOR 27.9; 95% CI: 12.09-64.6) and being overweight or obese (AOR 6.78; 95% CI: 3.53-13.01), but was protective of smoking (AOR 0.21; 95% CI: 0.07-0.61) and binge drinking (AOR 0.04; 95% CI: 0.01-0.45). Also, the risk of hypertension increased with age -30-39 years (AOR 12.29; 95% CI: 1.06-141.8), 40-49 years (AOR 14.28; 95% CI: 1.10-181.4) and 50 years and above (AOR 32.43; 95% CI: 2.44-413.7). Raised blood pressure was a strong correlate for having raised blood sugar (AOR 5.63; 95% CI: 1.48-21.3). Increasing age (IRR 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01-1.02) and being female (IRR 1.36; 95% CI: 1.23-1.49) were also important predictors of the clustering of risk factors.
   Conclusion
   The feminization (i.e. the preponderance of risk factors among the females) and clustering of non-communicable disease risk factors were observed among Oyo State civil servants. Our findings highlight the high prevalence of cardio-metabolic risk factors among the working class. Hence the need for targeted preventive and therapeutic interventions among this population.

   RESISTANCE; CHLOROQUINE; MEASLES; EPIDEMICS; INFECTION; VIVAX
AB Determining the distribution of disease prevalence among heterogeneous populations at the national scale is fundamental for epidemiology and public health. Here, we use a combination of methods (spatial scan statistic, topological data analysis and epidemic profile) to study measurable differences in malaria intensity by regions and populations of Colombia. This study explores three main questions: What are the regions of Colombia where malaria is epidemic? What are the regions and populations in Colombia where malaria is endemic? What associations exist between epidemic outbreaks between regions in Colombia? Plasmodium falciparum is most prevalent in the Pacific Coast, some regions of the Amazon Basin, and some regions of the Magdalena Basin. Plasmodium vivax is the most prevalent parasite in Colombia, particularly in the Northern Amazon Basin, the Caribbean, and municipalities of Sucre, Antioquia and Cordoba. We find an acute peak of malarial infection at 25 years of age. Indigenous and Afrocolombian populations experience endemic malaria (with household transmission). We find that Plasmodium vivax decreased in the most important hotspots, often with moderate urbanization rate, and was re-introduced to locations with moderate but sustained deforestation. Infection by Plasmodium falciparum, on the other hand, steadily increased in incidence in locations where it was introduced in the 2009-2010 generalized epidemic. Our findings suggest that Colombia is entering an unstable transmission state, where rapid decreases in one location of the country are interconnected with rapid increases in other parts of the country.

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID EPIDEMIOLOGIC RESEARCH; REPLICABILITY; RETRACTIONS
AB Objective
   Use of reproducible research practices improves the quality of science and the speed of scientific development. We sought to understand use of reproducible research practices in public health and associated barriers and facilitators.
   Methods
   In late 2017, we surveyed members of the American Public Health Association Applied Public Health Statistics section and others; 247 of 278 who screened eligible answered the survey, and 209 answered every applicable question. The survey included questions about file management, code annotation and documentation, reproducibility of analyses, and facilitators and barriers of using reproducible practices.
   Results
   Just 14.4% of participants had shared code, data, or both. Many participants reported their data (33%) and code (43.2%) would be difficult for colleagues to find if they left their institution. Top reported barriers to using reproducible practices were data privacy (49.8%) and lack of time (41.7%). Participants suggested training (50.9%) and requirements by journals (44.4%) and funders (40.2%) to increase use of reproducible research practices.
   Conclusions
   Increasing use of reproducible research practices is important for public health and requires action from researchers, training programs, funders, and journals.

TI Prevalence and factors associated with self-reported kidney disease
   among Serbian adults: Results of 2013 National Health Survey
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID STAGE RENAL-DISEASE; POPULATION; RISK; FRAILTY
AB Background
   Data from developing countries on the rates of kidney disease are scarce. The study aimed to estimate population-based prevalence of self-reported kidney disease (SRKD) in Serbia, describe co-occurrence of chronic diseases/conditions/functional limitations in respondents with SRKD and explore association between SRKD and possible risk factors.
   Methods
   We performed a secondary analysis of 2013 National Health Survey data. Data on a total of 14,587 respondents aged 15 years or older were analyzed using means of descriptive statistics, principal component analysis and logistic regression analysis.
   Results
   Out of all study respondents, 5.6% (95%CI 5.2-6.0) reported presence of kidney disease. Prevalence of all analyzed morbidities and functional limitations was higher in respondents with SRKD, and they had 8 times higher likelihood of being diagnosed with cirrhosis, 6.3 times higher likelihood of being diagnosed with urinary incontinence, more than 3 times higher likelihood of being diagnosed with degenerative disorder of bone and joint system. For cardiovascular diseases we obtained odds ratios (ORs) from 2.27 (95%CI 2.32-3.44) for heart attack to 2.95 (95%CI 2.43-3.57) for coronary heart disease. Number of co-occurrence patterns of kidney and other chronic diseases/conditions varied depending on inclusion of obesity in models. Logistic regression analysis showed that age explained most part of variability in the prevalence of SRKD and in the prevalence of two morbidities in respondents with SRKD, whereas the presence of three or more morbidities were associated with female gender, aging and low education level.
   Conclusions
   Our study provided evidence that the presence of kidney disease was significantly associated with socio-demographic, lifestyle characteristics and a number of morbidities in Serbia. There is a need for integrated care and public health interventions, tackling management of NCDs and their risk factors. Detailed well-designed studies, as part of cost-effective preventive approach, are needed for chronic kidney disease screening.

AB Background: Dementia has become a major public health issue worldwide due to its rapidly increasing prevalence and an increasing number of dementia-related deaths in long-term care facilities. The aim of this study was to examine health professionals' experiences of potential barriers and facilitators in providing palliative care for people with severe dementia in long-term care facilities.
   Methods: This was a qualitative descriptive study. The data were collected from four focus groups and 20 individual in-depth interviews with healthcare professionals from four Norwegian nursing homes. The data were analysed by thematic text analysis, as described by Braun and Clarke.
   Results: The major findings indicate that healthcare professionals experience a lack of continuity as the main barrier to facilitating palliative care. Time pressure and increased efficiency requirements especially affect the weakest and bedridden residents with dementia. The healthcare professionals feel conflicted between wanting to spend more time caring for each individual resident and feeling pressure to help everyone. Although resources are scarce, dying residents are always given priority by healthcare professionals, either by the hiring of extra personnel or the reorganization of tasks in a way that facilitates someone staying with the terminal resident. Advanced care planning was highlighted as a facilitator in providing palliative care, but the extensive use of temporary staff among nurses and doctors and the relocation between the sheltered and long-term wards threaten the continuity in planning and providing palliative care.
   Conclusions: The findings indicate that healthcare professionals experienced several structural barriers that prevented the provision of palliative care to people with severe dementia in long-term care facilities. Increasing demands for economic rationality lead to a lack of continuity of care. Organizational changes, such as measures to increase the competence and the proportion of permanent employees and the prevention of burdensome end-of-life transitions, should be implemented to improve continuity and quality of care.

AB Background: Cohort studies have public health importance as they effectively provide evidence on determinants of health from a life course perspective. Researchers often confront the poor follow-up rates as a major challenge in the successful conduct of cohort studies. We are currently recruiting in a birth cohort study, titled as "Maternal Antecedents of Adiposity and Studying the Transgenerational role of Hyperglycemia and Insulin" (MAASTHI) in a public hospital; with the aim of assessing maternal glycemic levels on the risk of adverse fetal outcomes. Nested within the ongoing cohort, the proposed trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions in improving the follow-up in the cohort study in a public hospital.
   Methods: A randomized trial of 795 pregnant women, with 265 women each in three arms observed through pregnancy, until their baby is 14 weeks old. The comparator group receives a standard leaflet, with details on the importance of glucose testing and regular follow up in pregnancy. Intervention arm-1 will receive the standard leaflet plus individualized messages, through an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system; a type of computer-linked telephone intervention system to remind the participants about the lab test and follow-up dates. Intervention arm- 2 will have the opportunity to attend Mother and Baby Affairs (MBA) workshops, which will provide information on Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) screening and management to pregnant women and personalized counselling services. The outcome of interest is the difference in the proportion of participants completing follow-up at different points in time, among three arms.
   Discussion: Between the two interventions (IVR and MBA), the study results would uncover the contextually specific, timely intervention, which can increase the proportion of pregnant women followed up in public hospitals. If effective, this study will provide information on an effective intervention, useful in ensuring the success of longitudinal follow-up in the public hospitals.

   Decision-making; Rural Bangladesh
ID SECTION; HEALTH; MORTALITY; REQUEST; BIRTH
AB Background: Caesarean section is a lifesaving surgical intervention for women and their newborns, though overutilization is a public health concern. The caesarean rate in Bangladesh is approximately 23% overall, and in private facilities it is over 70%. It is essential to know both the supply side (obstetricians) and demand side (parturient women) views on caesarean birth in order to formulate specific interventions to address the escalating rate of caesareans.
   Methods: This qualitative study took place in Matlab, a rural sub-district in Bangladesh. We interviewed women attending their 3rd antenatal visit, those with recent caesareans, and obstetricians from both public and private health facilities. In total there were twenty in-depth interviews and four focus group discussions. Study participants were asked about their preferences on birthing mode and knowledge of the caesarean section process. Thematic data analysis was done following a deductive approach.
   Results: Women from this rural community had a strong preference for normal vaginal birth. However, they were willing to accept the attending health care provider's decision for caesarean birth. Antenatal care sessions did not provide information on the medical indications for caesarean section. Furthermore, some women had the misconception that episiotomy itself is a 'small caesarean.' Primary health care providers and clinic agents (brokers) had a strong influence on women's decision to choose a health facility for giving birth. However, obstetricians, having a preference for caesarean section, were receiving more patients from these brokers which may be an important reason for the high rate of clinically non-indicated caesareans at private hospitals in Bangladesh. Improper labour monitoring and inadequate staffing at health facilities were additional influences on the preference for caesarean section. However, critical knowledge gaps were also observed among study obstetricians, particularly with regards to the indications for and timing of elective caesarean sections.
   Conclusion: There is a need to educate women about the advantages and disadvantages of different birthing modes to ensure their active participation in the decision making process. Strong policy regulations are needed to ensure legitimate decision making by obstetricians regarding mode of birthing.

ID CROSS-VALIDATION; MODELS; MORTALITY; CHILDREN; VACCINE
AB Risk maps of dengue disease offer to the public health officers a tool to model disease risk in space and time. We analyzed the geographical distribution of relative incidence risk of dengue disease in a high incidence city from Colombia, and its evolution in time during the period January 2009-December 2015, identifying regional effects at different levels of spatial aggregations. Cases of dengue disease were geocoded and spatially allocated to census sectors, and temporally aggregated by epidemiological periods. The census sectors are nested in administrative divisions defined as communes, configuring two levels of spatial aggregation for the dengue cases. Spatio-temporal models including census sector and commune-level spatially structured random effects were fitted to estimate dengue incidence relative risks using the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) technique. The final selected model included two-level spatial random effects, a global structured temporal random effect, and a census sector-level interaction term. Risk maps by epidemiological period and risk profiles by census sector were generated from the modeling process, showing the transmission dynamics of the disease. All the census sectors in the city displayed high risk at some epidemiological period in the outbreak periods. Relative risk estimation of dengue disease using INLA offered a quick and powerful method for parameter estimation and inference.

AB Background: Tungiasis is an ectoparasitic infestation, which still has public health importance in deprived populations of developing countries. Data on the prevalence and risk factors of tungiasis is rare in Ethiopia. Hence, this study was designed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of tungiasis among children in Wensho district, southern Ethiopia.
   Methods: From February to May 2016, we conducted a community-based cross-sectional study on 366 children 5-14 years old. Data about the presence and severity of tungiasis were obtained through inspection and data on risk factors were collected through interviews of parents/guardians of the children using structured questionnaire and through observation of the housing environment using structured checklist.
   Results: Two hundred fifteen (58.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 53.7%, 63.8%) of the 366 children were infested with Tungo penetrans. Most lesions were localized in the feet and the distribution of the disease by sex was similar (57.4% among males and 60.3% among females). Children of illiterate mothers (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 3.62, 95% CI: 1.35, 9. 73) and children whose mothers have attended only primary education (AOR: 2.72, 95% CI: 1.06, 6.97), children from cat owning households (AOR: 4.95, 95% CI: 1.19, 20.60) and children who occasionally use footwear (AOR: 7.42, 95% CI: 4.29, 12.83) and those who never use footwear (AOR: 12.55, 95% CI: 3.38, 46.58) had a significantly higher odds of tungiasis infestation.
   Conclusion: Tungiasis is an important public health problem with considerable morbidity among children in Wensho. Hence, implementation of tungiasis prevention strategies such as promoting shoes wearing, provision of health education, fumigating the residential houses and applying insecticides on pets are recommended.

AB Background: Microbial contamination of hospital environment, especially in operating theatres (OT) and other specialized units has greatly contributed to continuous and multiple exposure to nosocomial infections by patients and the public.
   We purposed to assess microbial contamination of operating theatres and antibacterial sensitivity pattern of bacteria isolated from theatres of Mbale Regional Referral Hospital, Eastern Uganda.
   Methods: We employed a laboratory based cross-sectional study design. Swabbing of different surfaces and settle plate establishment in 4 various operating theatres was carried out. A total of 109 samples were collected, 31 air samples and 78 swabs from four operating theatres. Samples were collected in the mornings after disinfection prior to start of daily operations. Antibacterial sensitivity testing of isolated bacterial pathogens was performed by Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method following standard operating procedure. Colony counts for the settle plates were carried out using a colony counter.
   Results: All the four theatres had their mean colony counts exceeding the acceptable limit of 5 cfu/dm(2)/h. Gynaecology theatre had up to 261 cfu/dm2/h and Ophthalmology operating theatre had approximately 43 cfu/dm(2)/h. A total of 14 different organisms were isolated with Pseudomonas spp. [23.9%); Bacillus spp. [17.5%) and Aspergillus spp. [15.8%) being the most common contaminants respectively. Other isolates included Enterococcus spp., Rhizopus spp. and Coagulate Negative Staphylococcus isolates especially from settle plates. Most bacterial isolates showed considerable resistance to antibacterial agents. Pseudomonas spp. was resistant to chloramphenicol (53.6%) and cotrimoxazole (57.1%). Most of the bacterial pathogens were sensitive to imipenem [83.3%).
   Conclusions: There is moderate contamination of operating theatres of Mbale Regional Referral Hospital. Common organisms were P.seudomonas, Bacillus, and Aspergillus spps. Resistance was observed against chloramphenicol and cotrimoxazole. More caution is necessary to carefully disinfect the operating theatres at Regional referral settings and similar tertiary health care centres with more emphasis on obstetrics and gynecology theatres. Diagnosis and care of patients at such clinical settings should consider the possibility of antibiotic resistance.

AB Background: Breast and colorectal cancer are the two most common cancers in Malaysia. Low awareness coupled with stigma and erroneous beliefs delay help-seeking behaviours, lead to late presentation and contribute to poor detection rates. Promoting cancer awareness through mass media may be effective in improving cancer-related knowledge and uptake in screening tests. However, research is sparse regarding the cultural translation and implementation of mass media campaigns in Malaysia (and Asia) in terms of raising awareness about colorectal and breast cancer.
   Methods: A collaborative partnership comprising researchers from Malaysia and the UK as well as policy makers, public health experts and non-government organisations from Malaysia was formed to design, deliver and evaluate the Be Cancer Alert Campaign. Each awareness-raising campaign will run for five weeks (Colorectal Cancer in April 2018, followed by Breast Cancer in October 2018). Evaluation of the campaigns will take place in Gombak district (Colorectal Cancer) and Petaling district (Breast Cancer) respectively, in the form of a pre-post randomly selected household survey and collection of service utilisation data. Occupants who are aged 40-years and above and are able to answer questions independently will be selected from each household. A sample of 730 with 80% power will detect a change of 6.09% in knowledge that unexplained lump or swelling is a symptom of breast cancer or changes in bowel habits is a symptom of colorectal cancer.
   Discussion: Malaysia and most South-East Asian countries have a low middle-income economy, with limited resources for cancer control. Late-staged cancers impose a significant economic burden on patients, households, communities, employers, health systems and governments. Our proposed strategy for the implementation of the culturally sensitive mass media cancer awareness-raising campaign will serve as a blueprint for cancer prevention and control policy in South-East Asian countries where the burden of cancer is increasing and there are high cancer death rates.

AB Background: Making older adults exercise and keeping them in exercise programs is a major challenge. Understanding how older adults prefer to exercise may help developing tailored exercise programs and increase sustained exercise participation in ageing populations. We aimed to describe exercise patterns, including frequency, intensity, type, location and social setting of exercise, in older adults instructed to follow continuous moderate-intensity training (MCT) or high-intensity interval training (HIIT) over a one-year period.
   Methods: Frequency, intensity, type, location and social setting (alone vs. together with others) of exercise were assessed using exercise logs from 618 older adults (aged 70-77 years) randomized to MCT or HIIT. All participants completed exercise logs after each exercise session they performed during one year. Pearson Chi-square tests were run to assess the association between intensity, type, location and social setting of exercise with training group.
   Results: Both groups performed 2.2 +/- 1.3 exercise sessions per week during the year. Walking was the most common exercise type in both groups, but MCT had a higher proportion of walking sessions than HIIT (54.2% vs. 41.1%, p < 0.01). Compared to MCT, HIIT had a higher proportion of sessions with cycling (14.2% vs. 9.8%, p < 0.01), combined endurance and resistance training (10.3% vs. 7.5%, p < 0.01), jogging (6.5% vs. 3.2%, p < 0.01) and swimming (2.6% vs. 1.7%, p < 0.01). Outdoors was the most common exercise location in both training groups (67.8 and 59.1% of all sessions in MCT and HIIT, respectively). Compared to MCT, HIIT had a higher proportion of sessions at a gym (21.4% vs. 17.5%, p < 0.01) and sports facility (9.8% vs. 7.6%, p < 0.01). Both groups performed an equal amount of sessions alone and together with others, but women had a higher proportion of sessions together with others compared to men (56% vs. 44%, p < 0.01).
   Conclusion: This is the first study that has followed older adults instructed to perform MCT or HIIT over a one-year period, collected data from each exercise session they performed and provided important knowledge about their exercise patterns. This novel information may help researchers and clinicians to develop tailored exercise programs in an ageing population.

AB Background: Intelligence generated by a surveillance system is dependent on the quality of data that are collected. We investigated the knowledge, attitudes and practices of nurses responsible for outbreak early warning surveillance data collection in Solomon Islands to identify factors that influence their ability to perform surveillance-related tasks with rigour.
   Methods: We interviewed 12 purposively selected surveillance nurses and conducted inductive analysis on resulting data.
   Results: Interviewees were knowledgeable and willing to contribute to the surveillance system. Constraining factors included the perception that surveillance was less important than patient care and could be 'deferred' during busy periods and wide variability in the application of case definitions. Motivating factors were frequent in-clinic training, formal recognition for good performance, incentives and designation of a focal point. Nurses held mixed views about the effect of mobile technologies on surveillance practice.
   Conclusions: This study identified several challenges to consistent and accurate data collection and reporting. Engagement of different parts of the health system, including human resources and health facilities' management, is needed to address these challenges.

SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Hospital economics; Public hospitals; Public services; Public hospitals
   expenditure; Hospital services utilisation; Healthcare area expenditure
   variability
ID REGIONAL-VARIATIONS; MEDICARE; SERVICE
AB Background: In Spain, hospital expenditure represents the biggest share of overall public healthcare expenditure, the most important welfare system directly run by the Autonomous Communities (ACs). Since 2001, public healthcare expenditure has increased well above the GDP growth, and public hospital expenditure increased at an even faster rate. This paper aims at assessing the evolution of need-adjusted public hospital expenditure at healthcare area level (HCA) and its association with utilisation and 'price' factors, identifying the relative contribution of ACs, as the main locus of health policy decisions.
   Methods: Ecological study on public hospital expenditure incurred in 198 (HCAs) in 16 Spanish ACs, between 2003 and 2015. Aggregated and annual log-log multilevel models, considering ACs as a cluster, were modelled using administrative data. HCA expenditure was analysed according to differences in population need, utilization and price factors. Standardised coefficients were also estimated, as well as the variance partition coefficients.
   Results: Between 2003 and 2015, over 59 million hospital episodes were produced in Spain for an overall expenditure of (sic) 384,200 million. Need-adjusted public hospital expenditure, at HCA level, was mainly associated to medical and surgical hospitalizations (standardized coefficients 0.32 and 0.28, respectively). The ACs explained 42% of the variance not explained by HCA utilization and 'price' factors.
   Conclusions: Utilization, rather than 'price' factors, may be explaining the difference in need-adjusted public hospital expenditure at HCA level in Spain. ACs, third-payers in the fully devolved Spanish National Health System, are responsible for a great deal of the variation in hospital expenditure.

AB Background: Hip fracture in elderly patients is a rising global public health concern because of population ageing, and increasing frailty. Long-term morbidity related to poor management of hip fracture is associated with decreased quality of life, survival, and increase in healthcare costs. Receiving postoperative rehabilitation is associated with better outcomes and a higher likelihood of returning to pre-existing level of functioning. However little is known about which postoperative rehabilitation pathways are more effective to optimize patient outcomes. Few studies have analyzed postoperative rehabilitation pathways in a universal healthcare system. The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of post-acute rehabilitation pathways on mortality and readmission in elderly patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture in a large metropolitan area in Italy.
   Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed 6-month mortality from admission and 6-month readmission after hospital discharge in patients who underwent surgical repair for hip fracture in the hospitals of the Bologna metropolitan area between 1.1.2013 and 30.6.2014. Data were drawn from the regional hospital discharge records database. Kaplan-Meier estimates and multiple Cox regression were used to analyze mortality as a function of rehabilitation pathways. Multiple logistic regression determined predictors of readmission.
   Results: The study population includes 2208 patients, mostly women (n = 1677, 76%), with a median age of 83.8 years. Hospital rehabilitation was provided to 519 patients (23.5%), 907 (41.1%) received rehabilitation in private inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRF) accredited by the National Health System, and 782 (35.4%) received no post-acute rehabilitation. Compared with patient receiving hospital rehabilitation, the other groups showed significantly higher mortality risks (no rehabilitation, Hazard Ratio (HR) = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.54-3.12, p < 0.001; IRF rehabilitation, HR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.54-1.79, p < 0.001). The risk of readmission did not differ significantly among rehabilitation pathways.
   Conclusions: Intensive hospital rehabilitation was significantly associated with a lower risk of mortality compared to IRF rehabilitation and no rehabilitation. Our results may help in the development of evidence-based recommendations aimed to improve resource utilization and quality of care in hip fracture patients. Further research is warranted to investigate the impact of the rehabilitation pathway on other outcomes, such as patients' functional status and quality of life.

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID DELIVERY; MORTALITY; PLACE
AB Introduction
   Antenatal care (ANC), health facility birth and postnatal care services are proved to reduce maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality. In Ethiopia, even though antenatal care coverage is good, still home birth is high. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and determinants of home birth among women who were booked for ANC in public hospitals in Wolaita zone, southern Ethiopia.
   Methods
   A cohort study was conducted from February to May 2017 among 554 third trimester pregnant mothers who visited public hospitals of Wolaita Zone, southern Ethiopia for ANC service. All women were interviewed twice: the first interview was done face-to-face in the health facility in which they were having ANC follow up to gather information about basic socio-demographic and obstetric characteristics; the second interview was done via telephone after they gave birth to get information about the place of birth. Epi-Data version 3.1 was used for data entry and the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22 was used for data analysis.
   Results
   A total of 68 (13.5%; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 10.5%-16.6%) women who were booked for ANC gave birth at home. Being uneducated (AOR = 2.46, 95% CI: [1.10-5.10]), starting ANC visit late (>16weeks) (AOR = 2.27, 95% CI: [1.14-4.50]), time taken to reach at health facility for ANC service (>30minutes) (AOR = 8.94, 95% CI: [4.50-17.72]), waiting time of greater than 30 minutes for ANC in health facilities (AOR = 1.18, 95% CI: [1.06-2.30]) and lack of knowledge about danger signs of pregnancy (AOR = 4.18, 95% CI: [1.80-9.70]) were significantly associated with home birth.
   Conclusions
   Home birth among ANC booked women is low compared to other studies. Yet, giving attention to women with no education and those coming from far areas while providing advice on birth preparedness and pregnancy danger signs may be useful to further reduce the rate of home birth. Advising mothers to start ANC early and trying to reduce ANC waiting time could also be of importance.

TI Assessing the performance of only HRP2 and HRP2 with pLDH based rapid
   diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of malaria in middle Ghana, Africa
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CHILDREN; HEALTH; BELT
AB Background
   Rapid diagnostic test (RDT) kits have been useful tools to screen for the presence of infection with malaria parasites. Despite the improvement, false results from RDTs present a greater challenge. The need for quality test kits is desirable. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of three malaria RDTs.
   Method
   The team consented and enrolled 754 participants from the two major public hospitals in Kintampo districts of Ghana from June 2014 to August 2014. Venous blood samples were obtained by trained personnel and samples were screened for malaria using CareStart and SD Bioline HRP2 and HRP2 with pLDH based RDTs with blood slides for malaria microscopy as "gold standard". Geometric mean parasite densities were estimated and parasite densities were used to estimate the quantitative limits of the RDTs. The sensitivities, specificities and other performance criteria were calculated using statistical analytical software.
   Result
   The median age of participants was 21 (range 5-31) years. There were 28.6% (215/752) were males and 71.4% (537/752) were females. Comparing with microscopy, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and the ROC were for CareStart (HRP2), 98.2%, 66.5%, 82.6%, 95.6%, 0.82; for CareStart (HRP2/pLDH) 98.2%, 66.5%, 82.6%, 95.6%, 0.82 and for SD-Bioline (HRP2/pLDH) RDTs 98.2%, 69.2%, 84.2%, 96.0%, 0.84 respectively. The performance for all the kits were acceptable at a cut-off of 25 or more parasites/mu l of blood.
   Conclusions
   The diagnostic performance of the three malaria RDTs was acceptable, according to the World Health Organisation criteria, to detect densities >= 25 parasite/mu l of blood. The RDTs with HRP2/pLDH targets were comparable to those with only HRP2 and could successfully substitute current and commonly used HRP2-based RDTs.

TI Knowledge, stigma, health seeking behaviour and its determinants among
   patients with post kalaazar dermal leishmaniasis, Bihar, India
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ONCHOCERCAL SKIN-DISEASE; ATTITUDE; AZAR; AREA
AB Background
   Lesishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease endemic in Bihar, India. Inappropriate health seeking behaviour of post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) patients may increase the disease duration, severity and transmissibility. Simultaneously, lack of knowledge and perceived stigma may also increase the length of delay in receiving treatment. This ultimately effects the kala-azar elimination program.
   Methods
   A cross sectional study was conducted in 120 confirmed PKDL patients, aged 18 years and older. Data related to knowledge and health seeking behaviour was collected by a pretested questionnaire. EMIC stigma scale was used for assessing the perceived stigma. Patients were personally interviewed after taking informed consent. Data analysis was done by using SPSS 16 software.
   Results
   The time between appearance of symptoms and first medical consultation (patient delay) ranged from 15 days to 5475 days (15 years) with a median of 285 days. The time between first medical consultations to onset of specific treatment (system delay) ranged from 2 to 5475 days with a median of 365 days. Many patients approached first to quacks (8.4%), homeopathic and ayurvedic practitioners (25.8%) upon recognition of symptoms. Majority of the patients (68.3%) had poor knowledge about PKDL and its vector. Type of skin lesions and gender had significant association with patient delay and system delay respectively (p<0.05). Distance to primary health centre (PHC) had significant association with patients delay as well as system delay (p<0.05). Patients with younger age, unmarried and polymorphic lesions had higher stigma (p<0.05). Patients with PKDL feel stigmatized in different areas.
   Conclusion
   PKDL treatment delays were unacceptably high and patients had poor knowledge compounded with feelings of stigmatization. To reduce the delay, a system may be evolved to establish some sort of public-private collaboration, besides awareness programs should be tailored, and implemented for improving the patient education regarding the disease and its linkage with VL.

TI A situational analysis of latent tuberculosis infection among
   incarcerated population in Japan
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article

   HIV
AB Background
   The World Health Organization recommends that systematic testing and screening of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) among the incarcerated population "should be considered", though based on evidence of either low or very low quality. However, in Japan, a TB middle-burden country, systematic screening for LTBI in correctional facilities is currently not conducted. As part of a larger study to determine the cost-effectiveness of LTBI screening in correctional facilities in Japan, this study was conducted to determine the situation of LTBI, including treatment outcome, among the incarcerated population in Japan, and provide the essential data for cost-effectiveness analysis.
   Method
   A cross-sectional study was conducted between 2017 and 2018 with public health centers which have one or more correctional facilities under their jurisdiction. Questionnaire surveys were sent to collect information on their policy of managing LTBI patients notified from correctional facilities, including whether or not there was a standardized procedure for initiating LTBI treatment, and also to collect sociodemographic information and treatment outcome of LTBI patients who were notified from the respective correctional facilities in 2015 and 2016.
   Results
   The survey was sent to a total of 163 public health centers, out of which 133 (81.6%) responded. 8 of the 133 public health centers actively guided the correctional facilities regarding LTBI treatment initiation through a standardized procedure, while 115 either had not established such procedure or were unaware of how LTBI treatment was being initiated in the correctional facilities. A total of 91 LTBI patients were notified from the correctional facilities in 2015 and 2016, and the information of 89 were available for analysis. 82 were males, and 83 were Japan-born. Treatment outcome was known for 88 patients, of which 70 had completed treatment. Of the 18 who did not complete the treatment, 15 had been lost to follow-up upon release from the facilities. Among those who had been released whilst on treatment, the proportion of those who completed the treatment was higher in those patients who received pre-release visit by a public health nurse, than those who did not.
   Conclusions
   LTBI treatment was often being initiated without consideration for the patients' prison term. The treatment completion rate within jail was high, indicating the possibility that incarcerated population can benefit for LTBI treatment. On the other hand, the completion rate decreased significantly among those who had been released while still on treatment. In order to optimize the benefit, initiation of LTBI must carefully be considered upon the patient's prison term, as well as coordination among the relevant organizations to ensure continuity of care after release.

AB Zika virus (ZIKV), an arthropod-borne virus, has emerged as a major human pathogen. Prolonged or persistent ZIKV infection of human cells and tissues may serve as a reservoir for the virus and present serious challenges to the safety of public health. Human hematopoietic cell lines with different developmental properties revealed differences in susceptibility and outcomes to ZIKV infection. In three separate studies involving the prototypic MR 766 ZIKV strain and the human monocytic leukemia U937 cell line, ZIKV initially developed only a low-grade infection at a slow rate. After continuous culture for several months, persistently ZIKV-infected cell lines were observed with most, if not all, cells testing positive for ZIKV antigen. The infected cultures produced ZIKV RNA (v-RNA) and infectious ZIKVs persistently ("persistent ZIKVs") with distinct infectivity and pathogenicity when tested using various kinds of host cells. When the genomes of ZIKVs from the three persistently infected cell lines were compared with the genome of the prototypic MR 766 ZIKV strain, distinct sets of mutations specific to each cell line were found. Significantly, all three "persistent ZIKVs" were capable of infecting fresh U937 cells with high efficiency at rapid rates, resulting in the development of a new set of persistently ZIKV-infected U937 cell lines. The genomes of ZIKVs from the new set of persistently ZIKV-infected U937 cell lines were further analyzed for their different mutations. The 2nd generation of persistent ZIKVs continued to possess most of the distinct sets of mutations specific to the respective 1st generation of persistent ZIKVs. We anticipate that the study will contribute to the understanding of the fundamental biology of adaptive mutations and selection during viral persistence. The persistently ZIKV-infected human cell lines that we developed will also be useful to investigate critical molecular pathways of ZIKV persistence and to study drugs or countermeasures against ZIKV infections and transmission.

TI Evaluating the progress to eliminate mother-to-child transmission (MTCT)
   of syphilis in Hunan Province, China: A study based on a health service
   delivery model
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PREGNANCY; OUTCOMES
AB To prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of syphilis, Hunan Province launched a free syphilis screening and treatment programme in 2011. Thus far, the programme has been implemented for 6 years. This study aimed to assess progress toward the elimination of MTCT of syphilis in Hunan Province from 2011-2016. Estimates of syphilis-related adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) were based on the health service delivery model developed by the WHO, which were then translated into disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Default values in the model were replaced by a Chinese version. The progress of this programme was assessed through the reduction of estimated DALYs with and without screening and treatment services. The results showed that the estimated number of syphilis-related APOs in Hunan Province from 2011 to 2016 was 3,840, more than 70% of which occurred among women who had at least one antenatal care visit but were not screened or treated for syphilis during pregnancy. The public health burden resulting from maternal syphilis-related APOs was 192,528 DALYs over six years, and with the current screening and treatment coverage, approximately 163,794 expected DALYs (46%) were averted. Our estimates indicate that in Hunan Province, syphilis in pregnancy continues to be an important cause of APOs, which can lead to substantial perinatal morbidity and mortality. Approximately half of the expected public health burden resulting from syphilis-related APOs was averted by the current screening and treatment services, which suggests progress toward the elimination of MTCT of syphilis in Hunan Province.

TI Influenza infection directly alters innate IL-23 and IL-12p70 and
   subsequent IL-17A and IFN-gamma responses to pneumococcus in vitro in
   human monocytes

   DIFFERENTIATION; NEURAMINIDASE
AB It is well accepted that influenza A virus predisposes individuals to often more severe super-infections with Streptococcus pneumonia. However, the mechanisms that lead to this synergy are not clearly understood. Recent data suggests that competent Th17 immunity is crucial to clearance and protection from invasive pneumococcal disease of the lung. We demonstrate that early influenza infection significantly reduced levels of pneumococcus driven IL-12p70, IL-23 and IL-27 in human monocytes with significant impairment of IL-17A and IFN-. in HKSP-treated allogeneic mixed lymphocyte cultures. We also provide evidence to suggest that the hemagglutinin component of the virus is at least partially responsible for this downward pressure on IL-17 responses but surprisingly this suppression occurs despite robust IL-23 levels in hemagglutinin-treated monocyte cultures. This study demonstrates that influenza can directly affect the immunological pathways that promote appropriate responses to Streptococcus pneumonia in human immune cells.
   Importance
   Influenza virus is highly contagious and poses substantial public health problems due to its strong association with morbidity and mortality. Approximately 250,000-500,000 deaths are caused by seasonal influenza virus annually, and this figure increases during periods of pandemic infections. Most of these deaths are due to secondary bacterial pneumonia. Influenza-bacterial superinfection can result in hospitalisation and/or death of both patients with pre-existing lung disease or previously healthy individuals. The importance of our research is in determining that influenza and its component haemagglutinin has a direct effect on the classic pneumococcus induced pathways to IL-17A in our human ex vivo model.
   Our understanding of the mechanism which leaves people exposed to influenza infection during superinfection remain unresolved. This paper demonstrates that early infection of monocytes inhibits an arm of immunity crucial to bacterial clearance. Understanding this mechanism may provide alternative interventions in the case of superinfection with antimicrobial resistant strains of bacteria.

AB Seasonal influenza virus infections cause yearly epidemics which are the source of a significant public health burden worldwide. The ferret model for human influenza A virus (IAV) is widely used and has several advantages over other animal models such as comparable symptomology, similar receptor distribution in the respiratory tract to humans and the ability to be infected with human isolates without the need for adaptation. However, a major disadvantage of the model has been a paucity of reagents for the evaluation of the cellular immune response. Investigation of T-cell mediated immunity in ferrets is crucial to vaccine development and efficacy studies. In this study we have used commercially produced antibodies to ferret interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) allowing us to reliably measure influenza-specific IFN-gamma as a marker of the cellular immune response using both enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) techniques. Here we demonstrate the application of these tools to evaluate cellular immunity in ferrets infected with clinically relevant seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 IAV subtypes at equivalent doses. Using small heparinised blood samples we were able to observe the longitudinal influenza-specific IFN-gamma responses of ferrets infected with both seasonal subtypes of IAV and found a notable increase in influenza-specific IFN-gamma responses in circulating peripheral blood within 8 days post-infection. Both seasonal strains caused a well-defined pattern of influenza-specific IFN-gamma responses in infected ferrets when compared to naive animals. Additionally, we found that while the influenza specific IFN-gamma responses found in peripheral circulating blood were comparable between subtypes, the influenza specific IFN-gamma responses found in lung lymphocytes significantly differed. Our results suggest that there is a distinct difference between the ability of the two seasonal influenza strains to establish an infection in the lung of ferrets associated with distinct signatures of acquired immunity.

AB Breast cancer represents the main malignancy in women and autologous fat grafting is a diffuse procedure in the management of post-surgical breast defects causing patients' psychosocial problems, with high costs for the public health. Recently, beneficial effects of fat grafting during post-surgical breast reconstruction have been amplified from the enrichment with human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) present in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of adult adipose tissue isolated during intraoperatory procedures. The major concern about the ASC enrichment during post-surgery breast reconstruction depends on their potential ability to release growth factors and hormones that can promote proliferation of residual or quiescent cancer cells, with the risk of de novo cancer development or recurrence. The recent description that adult stem cells primed in vitro may be vehicle for anticancer drug delivery offers a new vision concerning the role of ASCs in breast reconstruction after cancer surgery. Paclitaxel (PTX) is a chemotherapeutic agent acting as a microtubule-stabilizing drug inhibiting cancer cell mitotic activity. We optimized PTX loading and release in cultured ASCs and then analyzed the effects of PTX-loaded ASCs and their conditioned medium on CG5 breast cancer survival, proliferation and apoptosis in vitro, and inCG5 xenograft in vivo. We documented that ASCs can uptake and release PTX in vitro, with slight cytotoxic effects. Interestingly, PTX-loaded ASCs in co-culture, as well as conditioned medium alone, inhibited CG5 cell proliferation and survival in vitro and xenograft tumor growth in vivo. The antitumor effect of PTX-loaded ASCs may offer a new perspective concerning the use of ASCs during breast reconstruction becoming an additional local preventive chemotherapeutic agent against tumor recurrence. However, further experiments in vitro and in vivo are needed to collect more evidence confirming the efficacy and safety in cancer patients.

AB Background: Successful implementation of pay-for-quality (P4Q) programs mostly depends upon a valid, timely, and reliable data about quality measures generated by providers, and interpreted by payers. The aim of this study was to establish a data reporting method for P4Q program through an action research.
   Methods: Qualitative method was used to align theory with action through a three-cycle action research. The study was conducted in September 15, 2015 to March 15, 2017, in East-Azerbaijan, Iran. The purposeful sampling was used to select participants. The participants included healthcare providers, staff in district health centers (DHC), experts, and managers in the provincial primary health center (PPHC). Data was collected by interviews, focus group discussions, and expert panels. Content analysis was used to synthesize the data. In each step, decisions about data reporting methods were made through a consensus of expert panel members.
   Results: The most important dimensions of data reporting method were data entry and accuracy, data reporting, data analysis and interpretations, the flexibility of method, and training. By establishment of an online data reporting system for the P4Q program, a major improvement was observed in the documentation of performance data, the satisfaction of health care providers and staff (e.g. either in DHCs or PPHC), improvement of the P4Q program and acceptance of the P4Q program by providers. Following the present study, the online system was expanded in Iran's public health system for data collection and estimating the amount of incentive payments in P4Q program. Moreover, more improvements were achieved by linking the system to EMRs and also, providing automated feedback to providers about their own performance.
   Conclusions: A web-based computerized system with the capability of linking medical record and also its ability to provide feedback to healthcare providers was identified as an appropriate method of data reporting in the P4Q program from the viewpoints of participants in this study.

AB Background: Brazil has high burdens of tuberculosis (TB) and HIV, as previously estimated for the 26 states and the Federal District, as well as high levels of inequality in social and health indicators. We improved the geographic detail of burden estimation by modelling deaths due to TB and HIV and TB case fatality ratios for the more than 5400 municipalities in Brazil.
   Methods: This ecological study used vital registration data from the national mortality information system and TB case notifications from the national communicable disease notification system from 2001 to 2015. Mortality due to TB and HIV was modelled separately by cause and sex using a Bayesian spatially explicit mixed effects regression model. TB incidence was modelled using the same approach. Results were calibrated to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016. Case fatality ratios were calculated for TB.
   Results: There was substantial inequality in TB and HIV mortality rates within the nation and within states. National-level TB mortality in people without HIV infection declined by nearly 50% during 2001 to 2015, but HIV mortality declined by just over 20% for males and 10% for females. TB and HIV mortality rates for municipalities in the 90th percentile nationally were more than three times rates in the 10th percentile, with nearly 70% of the worst-performing municipalities for male TB mortality and more than 75% for female mortality in 2001 also in the worst decile in 2015. The same municipality ranking metric for HIV was observed to be between 55% and 61%. Within states, the TB mortality rate ratios by sex for municipalities in the worst decile versus the best decile varied from 1.4 to 2.9, and HIV varied from 1.4 to 4.2. The World Health Organization target case fatality rate for TB of less than 10% was achieved in 9.6% of municipalities for males versus 38.4% for females in 2001 and improved to 38.4% and 56.6% of municipalities for males versus females, respectively, by 2014.
   Conclusions: Mortality rates in municipalities within the same state exhibited nearly as much relative variation as within the nation as a whole. Monitoring the mortality burden at this level of geographic detail is critical for guiding precision public health responses.

TI Fidelity of HIV programme implementation by community health workers in
   rural Mopani district, South Africa: a community survey
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article

ID PREVENTION; CARE
AB Background: South Africa has implemented a community health programme delivered by community health workers (CHWs) to strengthen primary healthcare services. Provision of community Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) services constitutes an important component of this programme. To support effectiveness, we assessed fidelity of HIV programme implementation by CHWs from the community's perspective in a rural South African setting.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted targeting 900 randomly selected households in twelve wards of two sub-districts (Greater Giyani and Greater Letaba) of Mopani District (Limpopo Province, South Africa). Questionnaires were administered to the traditionally most appropriate adult member of the household. Included were questions related to the four standard components to measure implementation fidelity against local guidelines: coverage, frequency, duration and content of HIV programme implementation.
   Results: Participants were enrolled at 534 households; in most other cases there was nobody or no adult member at home (n = 291). Reported coverage of 55% (141/253) and a frequency of 47% (66/140) were higher in Greater Giyani as compared to Greater Letaba (44%; 122/278 and 29%; 33/112, respectively, p = 0.007 for both comparisons). Coverage was not associated with the distance from the participant's household to the facility (p = 0.93). Duration of programme delivery was reported to be high, where all CHW visits (253/253; 100%) were conducted within the last 6 months and the content delivered was adequate (242/253; 96%). Individuals reporting a CHW visit were more likely to know their HIV status than those not visited (OR = 2.0; 95% CI 1.06-3.8; p = 0.032). Among those visited by the CHW discussion of HIV was associated with knowing the HIV status (OR = 2.2; 95% CI 1.02-4.6; p = 0.044); in particular for women (OR = 2.9; 95% CI 1.5-5.4; p = 0.001).
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates promising HIV programme implementation fidelity by CHWs in rural South Africa. Programme coverage and frequency should be improved whilst maintaining the good levels of duration and content. Resource investment, strengthening of operational structure, and research to identify other facilitators of programme implementation are warranted to improve programme effectiveness and impact.

AB The emergence of carbapenem resistant Escherichia coli represents a serious public health concern. This study investigated the resistome, virulence, plasmids content and clonality of 27 carbapenem resistant E. coli isolated from 27 hospitalized patients at the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC) in Lebanon between 2012 and 2016. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data were used to identify resistance determinants. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST), pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), phylogenetic grouping and PCR-based replicon typing (PBRT) were also performed. The 27 isolates were distributed into 15 STs, of which ST405 (14.8%; n = 4) was the most prevalent. All of the 27 isolates were carbapenem resistant and 20 (74%) were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) gene carriers. The predominant detected carbapenemases were bla(OXA-48) (48.1%; n = 13) and bla(OXA-181) (7.4%; n = 2), for the ESBLs it was bla(CTX-M-15) (55.6%; n = 15) and bla(CTX-M-24) (18.5%; n = 5), and for the AmpC-type beta lactamases, bla(CMY-42) (40.7%; n = 11) and bla(CMY-2) (3.7%; n = 1). Thirteen replicons were identified among the 27 E. coli isolates including: IncL/M, IncFIA, IncFIB, IncFII, IncI1, and IncX3. PFGE revealed a high genetic diversity with the 27 isolates being grouped in 21 different pulsotypes. SNPs analysis and PFGE showed a possible clonal dissemination of ST405, ST1284, ST354 and ST410 and the dominance of certain STs, monitoring of which could help in elucidating routes of transmission. This study represents the first WGS-based in depth analysis of the resistomes and mobilomes of carbapenem resistant E. coli in Lebanon.

AB Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) are important human pathogens that are associated with a range of infection types, including wound and disseminated infections. Treatment has been complicated by rising rates of antimicrobial resistance. Immunoprophylactic strategies are not constrained by antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. Vaccines against these organisms would be important public health tools, yet they are not available. KP surface O polysaccharides (OPS) are protective antigens in animal models of infection. Similarly, PA flagellin (Fla), the major subunit of the flagellar filament, is required for virulence and is a target of protective antibodies in animal models. We report herein the development of a combined KP and PA glycoconjugate vaccine comprised of the four most common KP OPS types associated with human infections (O1, O2, O3, O5), chemically linked to the two Fla types of PA (FIaA, FlaB). Conjugation of KP OPS to PA Fla enhanced anti-polysaccharide immune responses and produced a formulation that generated antibody titers to the four KP OPS types and both PA Fla antigens in rabbits. Passive transfer of vaccine-induced rabbit antisera reduced the bacterial burden and protected mice against fatal intravenous KP infection. Mice passively transferred with conjugate-induced antisera were also protected against PA infection after thermal injury with a FlaB-expressing isolate, but not a FIaA isolate. Taken together, these promising preclinical results provide important proof-of-concept for a broad spectrum human vaccine to prevent KP and PA infections.

AB Background: Rabies is the only known zoonotic disease of bat origin in Europe. The disease is caused by species belonging to the genus Lyssavirus. Five Lyssavirus species, i.e., European bat lyssavirus (EBLV)-1, EBLV-2, Bokeloh bat lyssavirus, Lleida bat lyssavirus, and West Caucasian bat virus, have been identified in European bats. More recently, a proposed sixth species, Kotalahti bat lyssavirus, was detected. Thus, in this study, active surveillance was initiated in order to obtain insights into the prevalence of lyssaviruses in Croatian bat populations and to improve our understanding of the public health threat of infected bats.
   Results: In total, 455 bats were caught throughout Continental and Mediterranean Croatia. Antibodies were found in 20 of 350 bats (5.71%, 95% confidence interval 3.73-8.66). The majority of seropositive bats were found in Trbusnjak cave (Continental Croatia, Eastern part), and most seropositive bats belonged to Myotis myotis (13/20). All oropharyngeal swabs were negative for the presence of Lyssavirus.
   Conclusions: The presence of lyssaviruses in bat populations was confirmed for the first time in Croatia and Southeastern Europe. The results of this study suggest the need for further comprehensive analyses of lyssaviruses in bats in this part of Europe.

AB Background: There is increasing interest in estimating the broader benefits of public health interventions beyond those captured in traditional cost-utility analyses. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) in principle offers a way to capture such benefits, but a wide variety of methods have been used to monetise benefits in CBAs.
   Methods: To understand the implications of different CBA approaches for capturing and monetising benefits and their potential impact on public health decision-making, we conducted a CBA of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in the United Kingdom using eight methods for monetising health and economic benefits, valuing productivity loss using either (1) the human capital or (2) the friction cost method, including the value of unpaid work in (3) human capital or (4) friction cost approaches, (5) adjusting for hard-to-fill vacancies in the labour market, (6) using the value of a statistical life, (7) monetising quality-adjusted life years and (8) including both productivity losses and monetised quality-adjusted life years. A previously described transmission dynamic model was used to project the impact of vaccination on cervical cancer outcomes. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to capture uncertainty in epidemiologic and economic parameters.
   Results: Total benefits of vaccination varied by more than 20-fold (0.6-12.4 pound billion) across the approaches. The threshold vaccine cost (maximum vaccine cost at which HPV vaccination has a benefit-to-cost ratio above one) ranged from 69 pound (95% CI 56- pound  pound 84) to 1417 pound (1291- pound 1541) pound.
   Conclusions: Applying different approaches to monetise benefits in CBA can lead to widely varying outcomes on public health interventions such as vaccination. Use of CBA to inform priority setting in public health will require greater convergence around appropriate methodology to achieve consistency and comparability across different studies.

AB In recent years, air pollution has been a subject of great scientific and public interests for the strong impact on human health. Air pollution is due to the presence in the atmosphere of polluting substances, such as carbon monoxide, sulfur and nitrogen oxides, particulates and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), derived predominantly from various combustion processes. Benzene is a VOC belonging to group-I carcinogens with a toxicity widely demonstrated. The emission limit values and the daily exposure time to benzene (TLV-TWA) are 5 mu g/m(3) (0.00157 ppm) and 1.6mg/m(3) (0.5 ppm), respectively. Currently, expensive and time-consuming analytical methods are used for detection of benzene. These methods require to perform a few preliminary steps such as sampling, and matrices pre- treatments. In addition, it is also needed the support of specialized personnel. Recently, single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNTs) gas sensors with a limit detection (LOD) of 20 ppm were developed for benzene detection. Other innovative bioassay, called bio-report systems, were proposed. They use a whole cell (Pseudomona putida or Escherichia coli) as molecular recognition element and exhibit a LOD of about 10 mu M. Here, we report on the design of a highly sensitive fluorescence assay for monitoring atmospheric level of benzene. For this purpose, we used as molecular recognition element the porcine odorant-binding protein (pOBP). 1-Aminoanthracene was selected as extrinsic fluorescence probe for designing a competitive fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay for benzene detection. The detection limit of our assay wa s 3.9 mu g/m(3), a value lower than the actual emission limit value of benzene as regulated by European law.

AB The influence of early language and communication experiences on lifelong health outcomes is receiving increased public health attention. Most deaf children have non-signing hearing parents, and are at risk for not experiencing fully accessible language environments, a possible factor underlying known deaf population health disparities. Childhood indirect family communication-such as spontaneous conversations and listening in the routine family environment (e.g. family meals, recreation, car rides)-is an important source of health-related contextual learning opportunities. The goal of this study was to assess the influence of parental hearing status on deaf people's recalled access to childhood indirect family communication. We analyzed data from the Rochester Deaf Health Survey-2013 (n = 211 deaf adults) for associations between sociodemographic factors including parental hearing status, and recalled access to childhood indirect family communication. Parental hearing status predicted deaf adults' recalled access to childhood indirect family communication (chi(2) = 31.939, p < .001). The likelihood of deaf adults reporting "sometimes to never" for recalled comprehension of childhood family indirect communication increased by 17.6 times for those with hearing parents. No other sociodemographic or deaf-specific factors in this study predicted deaf adults' access to childhood indirect family communication. This study finds that deaf people who have hearing parents were more likely to report limited access to contextual learning opportunities during childhood. Parental hearing status and early childhood language experiences, therefore, require further investigation as possible social determinants of health to develop interventions that improve lifelong health and social outcomes of the underserved deaf population.

AB The use of social network sites (SNSs) has grown dramatically. Numerous studies have shown that SNS users may suffer from excessive use, associated with addictive-like symptoms. With a focus on the popular SNS Facebook (FB), our aims in the current study were twofold: First, to explore the heterogeneity of FB usage and determine which kind of FB activity predicts problematic usage; second, to test whether specific impulsivity facets predict problematic use of FB. To this end, a sample of FB users (N = 676) completed an online survey assessing usage preferences (e.g., types of activities performed), symptoms of problematic FB use and impulsivity traits. Results indicated that specific usage preferences (updating one's status, gaming via FB, and using notifications) and impulsive traits (positive and negative urgency, lack of perseverance) are associated to problematic FB use. This study underscores that labels such as FB "addiction" are misleading and that focusing on the actual activities performed on SNSs is crucial when considering dysfunctional usage. Furthermore, this study clarified the role of impulsivity in problematic FB use by building on a theoretically driven model of impulsivity that assumes its multidimensional nature. The current findings have identifiable theoretical and public health implications.

AB Background
   We aimed to study the effects of schooling on aspects of attention using the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) among children in rural Burkina Faso.
   Methods
   We re-enrolled children of a previously community-based cluster randomized exclusive breastfeeding trial in rural Burkina Faso. A total of 534 children (280 boys and 254 girls) aged 6 to 8 years were assessed using the TOVA. We examined the effect size difference using Cohen's d, ANOVA and conducted regression analyses.
   Results
   Forty nine percent of the children were in school. Children not in school performed poorly with a small effect size difference for 'Response Time', 'Errors of omission', and 'Errors of commission' compared to children in school. The effect size difference was moderate for 'Response Time Variability', and 'D prime score'.
   Conclusion
   Schooling affects different aspects of attention in rural Burkina Faso. In settings where literacy and schooling rate is low, public sensitizations of the benefits of schooling need to be reinforced and advice on sending children to school need to be provided continuously.

AB Background: Disrespectful and abusive maternity care is a complex phenomenon. In Namibia, HIV and high maternal mortality ratios make it vital to understand factors affecting maternity care quality. We report on two studies commissioned by Namibia's Ministry of Health and Social Services. A health worker study examined cultural and structural factors that influence maternity care workers' attitudes and practices, and a maternal and neonatal mortality study explored community perceptions about maternity care.
   Methods: The health worker study involved medical officers, matrons, and registered or enrolled nurses working in Namibia's 35 district and referral hospitals. The study included a survey (N = 281) and 19 focus group discussions. The community study conducted 12 focus groups in five southern regions with recently delivered mothers and relatives.
   Results: Most participants in the health worker study were experienced maternity care nurses. One-third (31%) of survey respondents reported witnessing or knowing of client mistreatment at their hospital, about half (49%) agreed that "sometimes you have to yell at a woman in labor," and a third (30%) agreed that pinching or slapping a laboring woman can make her push harder. Nurses were much more likely to agree with these statements than medical officers. Health workers' commitment to babies' welfare and stressful workloads were the two primary reasons cited to justify "harsh" behaviors. Respondents who were dissatisfied with their workload were twice as likely to approve of pinching or slapping. Half of the nurses surveyed (versus 14% of medical officers) reported providing care above or beneath their scope of work The community focus group study identified 14 negative practices affecting clients' maternity care experiences, including both systemic and health-worker-related practices.
   Conclusions: Namibia's public sector hospital maternity units confront health workers and clients with structural and cultural impediments to quality care. Negative interactions between health workers and laboring women were reported as common, despite high health worker commitment to babies' welfare. Key recommendations include multicomponent interventions that address heavy workloads and other structural factors, educate communities and the media about maternity care and health workers' roles, incorporate client-centered care into preservice education, and ensure ongoing health worker mentoring and supervision.

AB Influenza constitutes a major challenge to world health authorities due to high transmissibility and the capacity to generate large epidemics. This study aimed to characterize the diffusion process of influenza A (H1N1) by identifying the starting point of the epidemic as well as climatic and sociodemographic factors associated with the occurrence and intensity of transmission of the disease. The study was carried out in the Brazilian state of Parana A, where H1N1 caused the largest impact. The units of spatial and temporal analysis were the municipality of residence of the cases and the epidemiological weeks of the year 2009, respectively. Under the Bayesian paradigm, parametric inference was performed through a two-part spatiotemporal model and the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) algorithm. We identified the most likely starting points through the effective distance measure based on mobility networks. The proposed estimation methodology allowed for rapid and efficient implementation of the spatiotemporal model, and provided evidence of different patterns for chance of occurrence and risk of influenza throughout the epidemiological weeks. The results indicate the capital city of Curitiba as the probable starting point, and showed that the interventions that focus on municipalities with greater migration and density of people, especially those with higher Human Development Indexes (HDIs) and the presence of municipal air and road transport, could play an important role in mitigation of effects of future influenza pandemics on public health. These results provide important information on the process of introduction and spread of influenza, and could contribute to the identification of priority areas for surveillance as well as establishment of strategic measures for disease prevention and control. The proposed model also allows identification of epidemiological weeks with high chance of influenza occurrence, which can be used as a reference criterion for creating an immunization campaign schedule.

AB Background
   With the emergence of new influenza virus strains that are resistant to current inhibitors such as oseltamivir (anti-neuraminidase (NA)) and amantadine (anti-M2 proton channel), influenza A viruses continue to be a serious threat to the public health worldwide. With this in view, there is a persistent need for the development of broader and more effective vaccines and therapeutics. Identification of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that recognize relatively invariant structures on influenza haemagglutinin (HA) stem has invigorated efforts to develop universal influenza vaccines.
   Aim
   The current computational study is designed to identify potential flavonoid inhibitors that bind to the contact epitopes of HA stem that are targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAb).
   Method
   In this study, we utilized the three-dimensional crystallographic structure of different HA sub-types (H1, H2, H5, H3, and H7) in complex with bNAb to screen for potential broadly reactive influenza inhibitors. We performed Quantitative Structure-Activity and Relationship (QSAR) for 100 natural compounds known for their antiviral activity and performed molecular docking using AutoDock 4.2 suite. Furthermore, we conducted virtual screening of 1413 bioassay hit compounds by using virtual lab bench CLC Drug Discovery.
   Results
   The results showed 18 lead flavonoids with strong binding abilities to bNAb epitopes of various HA subtypes. These 18 broadly reactive compounds exhibited significant interactions with an average of seven Hbonds, docking energy of -22.43 kcal.mol(-1), and minimum interaction energy of -4.65 kcal.mol(-1), with functional contact residues. Procyanidin depicted strong interactions with group 1 HAs, whereas both sorbitol and procyanidin exhibited significant interactions with group 2 HAs.
   Conclusion
   Using in silico docking analysis, we identified 18 bioactive flavonoids with potential strong binding cababilities to influenza HA-stems of various subtypes, which are the target for bNAb. The virtual screened bioassay hit compounds depicted a high number of Hbonds but low interaction and docking values compared to antiviral flavonoids. Using structure-based design and nanotechnology-based approaches, identified molecules could be modified to generate next generation anti-influenza drugs.

DT Article
ID MODIFIED GREY MODEL
AB Background
   Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major public health threat in China for China has a hepatitis B prevalence of more than one million people in 2017 year. Disease incidence prediction may help hepatitis B prevention and control. This study intends to build and compare 2 forecasting models for hepatitis B incidence in China.
   Methods
   Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and grey model GM(1,1) were adopted to fit the monthly incidence of hepatitis B in China from March 2010 to October 2017. The fitting and forecasting performances of the 2 models were evaluated. The better one was adopted to predict the incidence from November 2017 to March 2018. Database was built by Excel 2016 and statistical analysis was completed using R 3.4.3 software.
   Results
   Descriptive analysis showed that the incidence of hepatitis B in China has seasonal variation and has shown a downward trend from 2010 to 2017. We selected the ARIMA (3,1,1) (0,1,2)(12) model among all the ARIMA models for it has the lowest AIC value. Model expression of GM (1,1) was X-(1) (k + 1) = 3386876.7478e(0.0249k) - 3289206.7428. The root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of ARIMA(3,1,1)(0,1,2)(12) model were lower than GM(1,1) model on fitting part and forecasting part. According to the forecast results, the incidence may have a slight fluctuation during the following months.
   Conclusions
   The ARIMA model showed better hepatitis B fitting and forecasting performance than GM (1,1) model. It is a potential decision supportive tool for controlling hepatitis B in China before a predictive hepatitis B outbreak.

AB Background: In Bangladesh, while the infrastructure of public health facilities to provide maternal and newborn care services is adequate, services are not always available due to insufficient staffing. A human resource availability index for health facilities is needed for monitoring and advocacy. This study aimed to develop indices for measuring the availability of different types of human resources to provide round-the-clock emergency obstetric and newborn care (EmONC) service at district-level public facilities.
   Methods: As part of a larger intervention study, 30 days of prospective observation of providers was done at a district hospital (DH) and a mother and child welfare centre (MCWC) in one district of Bangladesh using checklists. A scoring system was developed to create an index to quantify the availability of providers for maternal and newborn care.
   Results: Based on the newly developed index, medical doctors in the emergency department of the DH were 100% available, but ranged from 27 to 41% availability in the obstetrics/gynecology (ob/gyn) and pediatric wards. In MCWC, the corresponding indices ranged from 32 to 36%. In the DH, the availability of nurses in the ob/gyn ward (96%) was relatively better than in the pediatric ward (65%) but that in operation theatre was only 31%. In the MCWC, the index for the presence of a paramedic or nursing aid was 82% in the ob/gyn ward and 63% in the operation theatre. However, the availability scores of facility support staff for maintenance and security were generally high (over 90%) in both facilities.
   Conclusions: Our newly developed index on availability of providers demonstrated huge gaps in availability of providers in evening and night shifts in most of the disciplines in the study facilities. This provider availability index is easy to create and can be used as a meaningful tool to quantify gaps in human resources by type in various types of district-level health facilities. Further studies are needed for adaptation of this tool in different types of health facilities and to assess its implication as an advocacy tool.

AB Background: Routine health information systems (RHIS) are vital for the acquisition of data for health sector planning, monitoring, and evaluation. However, in developing countries the insufficient quality of the data produced by RHIS limits their usefulness in decision-making. As routine health information utilization is still low in Ethiopia, this study aimed to assess the magnitude of routine health data utilization and associated factors among health care professionals in some public health institutions in North Gondar, northwest Ethiopia.
   Methods: An institution based cross-sectional study was conducted from March to April2017, at public health institutions of North Gondar Zone, northwest Ethiopia. A total of 720 health care professionals were selected from public health institutions using the multi-stage sampling technique. Data were collected using a structured self-administered questionnaire and an observational checklist, cleaned, coded, and entered into Epi-info version 3.5.3 and transferred into SPSS version 20 for further statistical analysis. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, a less than 0.05 P-vale was considered statistically significant.
   Result: In this study, the level of good routine health information utilization among health professionals was 78.5% (95% CI: 73.2%, 84.3%). According to the multivariable logistic regression analysis, sex (AOR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.47, 3.27), type of institution (AOR = 3.57, 95% CI: 2.39, 5.32), standard indicators (AOR = 3.28, 95% CI: 1.90, 5.65), data analysis skills (AOR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.12, 3.23), and good governance (AOR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.31, 2.95), were found significantly associated with a good level of health information utilization.
   Conclusion: Over three-fourths of the health care professionals working at public health institutions of North Gondar utilized health information better than the respondents in previous studies. Sex, type of institution, standard indicators, data analysis skills, and governance were factors related to routine health information utilization. Therefore, standard indicators, data analysis skills and good governance are highly recommended for improving routine health data utilization of health care professionals working at public health institutions.

AB Background: Viral infection by dengue virus is a major public health problem in tropical countries. Early diagnosis and detection are increasingly based on quantitative reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) directed against genomic regions conserved between different isolates. Genetic variation can however result in mismatches of primers and probes with their targeted nucleic acid regions. Whole genome sequencing allows to characterize and track such changes, which in turn enables to evaluate, optimize, and (re-)design novel and existing RT-qPCR methods. The immense amount of available sequence data renders this however a labour-intensive and complex task.
   Results: We present a bioinformatics approach that enables in silico evaluation of primers and probes intended for routinely employed RT-qPCR methods. This approach is based on analysing large amounts of publically available whole genome data, by first employing BLASTN to mine the genomic regions targeted by the RT-qPCR method(s), and afterwards using BLASTN-SHORT to evaluate whether primers and probes will anneal based on a set of simple in silico criteria. Using dengue virus as a case study, we evaluated 18 published RT-qPCR methods using more than 3000 publically available genomes in the NCBI Virus Variation Resource, and provide a systematic overview of method performance based on in silico sensitivity and specificity.
   Conclusions: We provide a comprehensive overview of dengue virus RT-qPCR method performance that will aid appropriate method selection allowing to take specific measures that aim to contain and prevent viral spread in afflicted regions. Notably, we find that primer-template mismatches at their 3' end may represent a general issue for dengue virus RT-qPCR detection methods that merits more attention in their development process. Our approach is also available as a public tool, and demonstrates how utilizing genomic data can provide meaningful insights in an applied public health setting such as the detection of viral species in human diagnostics.

People with vision impairment have unique characteristics because those invited are often elderly and totally or partially dependent on help to complete daily activities such as travelling to study sites. Therefore, participation of people with impaired vision in studies is less predictable than predicting participation for the general population.
   Methods: Participants were recruited in the context of a study of prevalence and costs of visual impairment in Portugal (PCVIP-study). Participants were recruited from 4 Portuguese public hospitals. Inclusion criteria were: acuity in the better eye from 0.5 decimal (0.30logMAR) or worse and/or visual field of less than 20 degrees. Recruitment involved sending invitation letters and follow-up phone calls. A multiple logistic regression model was used to assess determinants of participation. The J48 classifier, chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were applied to investigate the possible differences between subjects in our sample.
   Results: Individual cases were divided into 3 groups: immediate, late and non-participants. A participation rate of 20% was obtained (15% immediate, 5% late). Factors positively associated with participation included years of education, annual hospital attendance, and intermediate visual acuity. Females and greater distance to the hospital were inversely associated with participation.
   Conclusion: In our study, a letter followed by a phone call was efficient to recruit a significant number of participants from a larger group of people with impaired vision. However, the improvement in participation observed after the phone call might not be cost-effective. People with low levels of education and women were more difficult to recruit. These findings need to be considered to avoid studies whose results are biased by gender or socioeconomic inequalities of their participants. Young subjects and those at intermediate stages of vision impairment, or equivalent conditions, may need more persuasion than other profiles.

AB Background: Despite the epidemiological evidence about the relationship between diabetes, mortality and cardiovascular disease, information about the population impact of uncontrolled diabetes is scarce. We aimed to estimate the attributable risk associated with HbA1c levels for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalization.
   Methods: Prospective study of subjects with diabetes mellitus using electronic health records from the universal public health system in the Valencian Community, Spain 2008-2012. We included 19,140 men and women aged 30 years or older with diabetes who underwent routine health examinations in primary care.
   Results: A total of 11,003 (57%) patients had uncontrolled diabetes defined as HbA1c >= 6.5%, and, among those, 5325 participants had HbA1c >= 7.5%. During an average follow-up time of 3.3 years, 499 deaths, 912 hospitalizations for coronary heart disease (CHD) and 786 hospitalizations for stroke were recorded. We observed a linear and increasingly positive dose-response of HbA1c levels and CHD hospitalization. The relative risk for all-cause mortality and CHD and stroke hospitalization comparing patients with and without uncontrolled diabetes was 1.29 (95 CI 1.08,1.55), 1.38 (95 CI 1.20,1.59) and 1.05 (95 CI 0.91, 1.21), respectively. The population attributable risk (PAR) associated with uncontrolled diabetes was 13.6% (95% CI; 4.0-23.9) for all-cause mortality, 17.9% (95% CI; 10.5-25.2) for CHD and 2.7% (95% CI; -5.5-10.8) for stroke hospitalization.
   Conclusions: In a large general-practice cohort of patients with diabetes, uncontrolled glucose levels were associated with a substantial mortality and cardiovascular disease burden.

AB The ever-increasing number of reasons forcing people to flee from their homes to new, safer places either within their countries of origin, into neighbouring countries or across continental, conversant and cultural boundaries has led to a humanitarian crisis to which scientific enquiry must increasingly contribute. Yet, little is known about how best to support refugee adults and children in the process of resettling in high-income nations, an issue which the recent study by Lau et al. published in this journal, is attempting to address. Their study highlights how refugee parents, children and adolescents report good child mental health and adjustment approximately 3-4 years after gaining humanitarian visa status to remain in Australia. Herein, the need to support parenting capability and to facilitate public policy to work within an evidence-based framework are discussed.

AB Background: Over the past 40 years, the Chinese government has diligently promoted the market-oriented reform of the health insurance system. However, as it is affected by the urban-rural dual structure, most rural-to-urban migrants are excluded from local public health services and medical insurance schemes in the cities in which they live. Buying local commercial medical insurance (CMI) is an important way for migrants to obtain local medical services. Therefore, this study's purposes were to explore the city factors that affect migrants' purchase of CMI and to investigate the relationship between urbanisation and migrants' purchase of CMI.
   Methods: This study used the 2013 National Floating Population (Migrants) Dynamic Monitoring Survey data, which covered 31 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in China. The respondents were migrants (1559 years; n = 164,752) who lived in the inflow areas for more than a month without obtaining a local household registration record. We used city factors, neighbourhood factors, and individual factors that affect residents' purchase of CMI to construct a theoretical framework and examined the effect of urbanisation on migrants' choice of CMI using multilevel logistic regression.
   Results: The proportion of migrants who had local or hometown CMI was 5.70%; most migrants had no CMI (94. 30%). Of these, 4.42% had CMI in the city in which they live (i.e. local CMI) and 1.64% had CMI in their hometown (i. e. hometown CMI). Migrants living in first-tier and third-tier cities were less likely to have CMI than those in secondtier cities (odds ratio [OR] = 0.454, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.395-0.521; OR = 0.588, 95% CI: 0.464-0.746). Furthermore, the regression results revealed a U-shaped relationship between the odds of migrants having CMI and the urbanisation rate of the prefecture-level cities. The findings also indicated that with higher socioeconomic status, there was a greater probability of purchasing CMI.
   Conclusions: The improvement of urbanisation has a positive effect on migrants' purchase of CMI. However, China's medical insurance market is still underdeveloped. It is necessary for the Chinese government to increase migrants' participation rate in CMI to cover soaring medical expenses.

AB Background: Viral hepatitis, mainly hepatitis B and C, is a serious public health problem worldwide. In China, the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains high, while that of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is controversial. This study investigated the epidemiology of HBV and HCV infections and assessed the beneficial effect of the vaccination strategy for hepatitis B in Northeastern China.
   Methods: From June 2016 to August 2016, 6541 residents of Changchun in Northeastern China were recruited for this cross-sectional study. Demographic characteristics as well as HBV and HCV serological test results were reviewed and analyzed.
   Results: Among all study participants, 3.8% and 0.36% tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HCV, respectively. The HBsAg- and anti-HCV-positive rates were significantly higher in male participants (4.58% and 0.43%) than in female individuals (3.0% and 0.33%). Notably, among all age groups, the lowest rate of HBsAg positivity (0.2%) was found in children born after the implementation of the vaccination strategy for hepatitis B. Conversely, participants aged 40-49 years had significantly greater positive rates of HBsAg (5.9%) compared with those of other age groups. Furthermore, the highest rates of anti-HCV positivity (1.1%) were observed in participants aged 50-59 years.
   Conclusions: The rate of HBsAg-positivity declined significantly following successful implementation of the policy on hepatitis B vaccination, indicating a beneficial impact on the control of HBV infection. However, only a slight decrease was observed in the anti-HCV-positivity rate, identifying an area in need of improvement within viral hepatitis prevention and control programs in China.

AB Background: Influenza is an acute viral disease of the respiratory tract which is characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, prostration, coryza, sore throat and cough. Globally, an estimated 3 to 5 million cases of severe influenza illness and 291 243-645 832 seasonal influenza-associated respiratory deaths occur annually. Although recent efforts from some African countries to describe burden of influenza disease and seasonality, these data are missing for the vast majority, including Ethiopia. Ethiopia established influenza sentinel surveillance in 2008 aiming to determine influenza strains circulating in the country and know characteristics, trend and burden of influenza viruses.
   Methods: We used influenza data from sentinel surveillance sites and respiratory disease outbreak investigations from 2009 to 2015 for this analysis. We obtained the data by monitoring patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) at three health-centers, severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) at five hospitals and investigating patients during different respiratory infection outbreaks. Throat-swab specimens in viral transport media were transported to the national reference laboratory within 72 h of collection using a cold-chain system. We extracted viral RNA from throat-swabs and subjected to real-time PCR amplification. We further subtyped and characterized Influenza Apositive specimens using CDC real-time reverse transcription PCR protocol.
   Results: A total of 4962 throat-swab samples were collected and 4799 (96.7%) of them were tested. Among them 988 (20.6%) were influenza-positive and of which 349 (35.3%) were seasonal influenza A(H3N2), 321 (32.5%) influenza A(H1N1) pdm2009 and 318 (32.0%) influenza B. Positivity rate was 29.5% in persons 5-14 years followed by 26.4% in 15-44 years, 21.2% in > 44 years and 6.4% in under five children. The highest positivity rate observed in November (37.5%) followed by March (27.6%), December (26.4%), October (24.4%) and January (24.3%) while the lowest positivity rate was in August (7.7%).
   Conclusion: In Ethiopia, seasonal Influenza A(H3N2), Influenza A(H1N1) pdm2009 and Influenza B viruses were circulating during 2009-2015. Positivity rate and number of cases peaked in November and December. Influenza is one of public health problems in Ethiopia and the need to introduce influenza vaccine and antivirus is important to prevent and treat the disease in future.

   college; Ethiopia
AB Background: Low vision and blindness are major public health problems. A vast burden of worlds visually impaired live in low-income settings especially in sub Saharan Africa. In such settings the blindness is associated with considerable disability and excess mortality, resulting in huge economic and social consequence. The main purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and associated factors of low vision and blindness among patients at St. Paul's hospital millenium medical college.
   Methods: Institution based cross sectional design study was carried out from January to April, 2017 with sample size of 904. Systematic random sampling was used to recruit the study subjects. Retrospective medical chart review was done; data was entered into and analyzed by SPSS 23. Descriptive statistics such as frequency cross tabulation and chi-square test was carried out to translate data into information. P-value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
   Results: A total of 881 subjects with a response rate of 97.4% selected. The mean age of the study subjects was 44.53(SD: +/- 21.85) with a range of 1-100 years. The prevalence of low vision and blindness was 91 (10.3% (95% CI: 8.2, 12.3)), and 64 (7.3 95% CI: 5.7, 9.0)) respectively. Age (p-value < 0.001), cataract (p-value = 0.002), glaucoma (p-value = 0.002) and age related macular degeneration (p-value < 0.001) were significantly associated with low vision and blindness.
   Conclusion: Low vision and blindness found in this study was high. Age, cataract, glaucoma and age related macular degeneration were significantly associated with low vision and blindness. This amount of magnitude will be reduced if prevention, early diagnosis and management will be targeted towards avoidable causes of visual impairment.

TI Nutritional quality of food as represented by the FSAm-NPS nutrient
   profiling system underlying the Nutri-Score label and cancer risk in
   Europe: Results from the EPIC prospective cohort study
SO PLOS MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID FRONT-OF-PACKAGE; DIETARY INDEX; PROSPECTIVE ASSOCIATION; VALIDATION;
   IMPACT
AB Background
   Helping consumers make healthier food choices is a key issue for the prevention of cancer and other diseases. In many countries, political authorities are considering the implementation of a simplified labelling system to reflect the nutritional quality of food products. The Nutri-Score, a five-colour nutrition label, is derived from the Nutrient Profiling System of the British Food Standards Agency (modified version) (FSAm-NPS). How the consumption of foods with high/low FSAm-NPS relates to cancer risk has been studied in national/regional cohorts but has not been characterized in diverse European populations.
   Methods and findings
   This prospective analysis included 471,495 adults from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC, 1992-2014, median follow-up: 15.3 y), among whom there were 49,794 incident cancer cases (main locations: breast, n = 12,063; prostate, n = 6,745; colon-rectum, n = 5,806). Usual food intakes were assessed with standardized country-specific diet assessment methods. The FSAm-NPS was calculated for each food/beverage using their 100-g content in energy, sugar, saturated fatty acid, sodium, fibres, proteins, and fruits/vegetables/legumes/nuts. The FSAm-NPS scores of all food items usually consumed by a participant were averaged to obtain the individual FSAm-NPS Dietary Index (DI) scores. Multi-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were computed. A higher FSAm-NPS DI score, reflecting a lower nutritional quality of the food consumed, was associated with a higher risk of total cancer (HRQ5 versus (Q1) = 1.07; 95% CI 1.03-1.10, P-trend < 0.001). Absolute cancer rates in those with high and low (quintiles 5 and 1) FSAm-NPS DI scores were 81.4 and 69.5 cases/10,000 person-years, respectively. Higher FSAm-NPS DI scores were specifically associated with higher risks of cancers of the colon-rectum, upper aerodigestive tract and stomach, lung for men, and liver and postmenopausal breast for women (all P < 0.05). The main study limitation is that it was based on an observational cohort using self-reported dietary data obtained through a single baseline food frequency questionnaire; thus, exposure misclassification and residual confounding cannot be ruled out.
   Conclusions
   In this large multinational European cohort, the consumption of food products with a higher FSAm-NPS score (lower nutritional quality) was associated with a higher risk of cancer. This supports the relevance of the FSAm-NPS as underlying nutrient profiling system for front-of-pack nutrition labels, as well as for other public health nutritional measures.

AB Systemic insecticides in dogs have been suggested as a public health intervention to prevent human cases of Zoonotic Visceral Leishmaniasis (ZVL). But, currently there are no systemic insecticides for dogs registered against zoo-anthropophilic pool blood feeding phlebotomine flies. We predict the impact of community-wide use of systemic insecticide in dog populations as a public health measure to control transmission of Leishmania infantum to humans using a mathematical model. We developed a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected (SEI) compartmental model to describe L. infantum transmission dynamics in dogs, with a vectorial capacity term to represent transmission between L. infantum-hosting dogs via phlebotomine flies. For Infected (I) dogs two levels of infectiousness were modelled, high infectiousness and low infectiousness. Human incidence was estimated through its relationship to infection in the dog population. We evaluated outcomes from a wide range of scenarios comprising different combinations of initial insecticide efficacy, duration of insecticide efficacy over time, and proportion of the dog population treated (60%, 70% & 80%). The same reduction in human infection incidence can be achieved via different combinations of insecticide efficacy, duration and dog coverage. For example, a systemic insecticide with an initial efficacy of 80% and 6 months above 65% efficacy would require treating at least 70% of the dogs to reduce the human infection incidence by 50%. Sensitivity analysis showed that the model outcome was most sensitive to baseline values of phlebotomine fly daily survival rate and insecticide coverage. Community-wide use of systemic insecticides applied to the "L. infantum canine reservoir" can significantly reduce human incidence of L. infantum infection. The results of this mathematical model can help defining the insecticide target product profile and how the insecticide should be applied to maximise effectiveness.

AB Leptospirosis is a neglected zoonosis with worldwide distribution. The causative agents are spirochete bacteria of the Leptospira genus, displaying huge diversity of serovars, the identity of which is critical for effective diagnosis and vaccination purposes. Among many other mammalian species, Leptospira infects cattle, eliciting acute signs in calves, and chronic disease in adult animals often leading to abortions. In South America, and including in Uruguay, beef and dairy export are leading sources of national income. Despite the importance of bovine health, food safety, and bovine-related dissemination of leptospirosis to humans, extremely limited information is available as to the identity of Leptospira species and serovars infecting cattle in Uruguay and the South American subcontinent. Here we report a multicentric 3-year study resulting in the isolation and detailed characterization of 40 strains of Leptospira spp. obtained from infected cattle. Combined serologic and molecular typing identified these isolates as L. interrogans serogroup Pomona serovar Kennewicki (20 strains), L. interrogans serogroup Canicola serovar Canicola (1 strain), L. borgpetersenii serogroup Sejroe serovar Hardjo (10 strains) and L. noguchii (9 strains). The latter showed remarkable phenotypic and genetic variability, belonging to 6 distinct serogroups, including 3 that did not react with a large panel of reference serogrouping antisera. Approximately 20% of cattle sampled in the field were found to be shedding pathogenic Leptospira in their urine, uncovering a threat for public health that is being largely neglected. The two L. interrogans serovars that we isolated from cattle displayed identical genetic signatures to those of human isolates that had previously been obtained from leptospirosis patients. This report of local Leptospira strains shall improve diagnostic tools and the understanding of leptospirosis epidemiology in South America. These strains could also be used as new components within bacterin vaccines to protect against the pathogenic Leptospira strains that are actually circulating, a direct measure to reduce the risk of human leptospirosis.

AB Forecasting the emergence and spread of influenza viruses is an important public health challenge. Timely and accurate estimates of influenza prevalence, particularly of severe cases requiring hospitalization, can improve control measures to reduce transmission and mortality. Here, we extend a previously published machine learning method for influenza forecasting to integrate multiple diverse data sources, including traditional surveillance data, electronic health records, internet search traffic, and social media activity. Our hierarchical framework uses multi-linear regression to combine forecasts from multiple data sources and greedy optimization with forward selection to sequentially choose the most predictive combinations of data sources. We show that the systematic integration of complementary data sources can substantially improve forecast accuracy over single data sources. When forecasting the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) influenza-like-illness reports (ILINet) from week 48 through week 20, the optimal combination of predictors includes public health surveillance data and commercially available electronic medical records, but neither search engine nor social media data.

   the risk of arbovirus outbreaks
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English

AB Background
   Aedes-borne arboviruses have emerged as an important public health problem worldwide and, in Mozambique, the number of cases and its geographical spread have been growing. However, information on the occurrence, distribution and ecology of Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes remain poorly known in the country.
   Methods
   Between March and April 2016, a cross-sectional study was conducted in 32 districts in Mozambique to determine the distribution and breeding sites of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. Larvae and pupae were collected from a total of 2,807 water-holding containers using pipette, dipper, funnel and sweeping procedures, depending on the container type and location. Both outdoor and indoor water-holding containers were inspected. The immature forms were reared to adults and the identifications of the mosquito species was carried out with a stereomicroscope using a taxonomic key.
   Results
   Aedes aegypti was found in every district sampled, while Ae. albopictus was only found in Moatize district, situated in Tete Province in the central part of the country. Six hundred and twenty-eight of 2,807 (22.4%) containers were positive for Ae. aegypti but only one (0.03%) was positive for Ae. albopictus. The Container Index (CI) of Aedes was highest in densely populated suburban areas of the central region (260/604; 43.0%), followed by suburban areas in northern areas (228/617; 36.9%) whilst the lowest proportion was found in urbanized southern areas (140/1586; 8.8%). The highest CI of Aedes was found in used tires (448/1268; 35.3%), cement tanks (20/62; 32.3%) and drums (21/95; 22.1%).
   Conclusion
   Data from our study showed that Ae. aegypti is present nation-wide, since it occurred in every sampled district, whilst Ae. albopictus had a limited distribution. Therefore, the risk of transmission of dengue and chikungunya is likely to have been underestimated in Mozambique. This study highlights the need for the establishment of a national entomological surveillance program for Aedes spp. in Mozambique in order to gain a better understanding about vector bionomics and to support the development of informed effective vector control strategies.

TI Filarial infection during pregnancy has profound consequences on immune

AB Background
   Current Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) that prohibits pregnant mothers and children below two years of age from coverage targeted interruption of transmission after 5-6 rounds of annual mass drug administration (MDA). However, after more than 10 rounds of MDA in India the target has not been achieved, which poses challenge to the researchers and policy makers. Several studies have shown that in utero exposure to maternal filarial infections plays certain role in determining the susceptibility and disease outcome in children. But the mechanism of which has not been studied extensively. Therefore the present study was undertaken to understand the mechanism of immune modulation in children born to filarial infected mother in a MDA ongoing area.
   Methodology and principal finding
   To our knowledge this is the first study to conduct both cellular and humoral immunological assays and follow up the children until older age in a W bancrofti endemic area,where the microfilariae (Mf) rate has come down to <1% after 10 rounds of MDA. A total 57 (32: born to infected, 25: born to uninfected mother) children were followed up. The infection status of children was measured by presence of Mf and circulating filarial antigen (CFA) assay. Filaria specific IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 responses were measured by ELISA. Plasma level of IL-10 and IFN-gamma were evaluated by using commercially available ELISA kit. The study reveals a high rate of acquisition of filarial infection among the children born to infected mother compared to uninfected mothers. A significantly high level of IgG1 and IgG4 was observed in children born to infected mother, whereas high level of IgG3 was marked in children born to uninfected mother. Significantly high level of IL-10 positively correlated with IgG4 have been observed in infected children born to infected mother, while high level of IFN-gamma positively correlated with IgG3 was found in infection free children born to mother from infection at the time of pregnancy. Moreover a negative correlation between IL-10 and IFN-gamma has been observed only among the infected children born to infected mother.
   Significance conclusion
   The study shows a causal association between maternal filarial infection and impaired or altered immune response in children more susceptible to filarial infection during early childhood. As lymphatic damage that commences in childhood during asymptomatic stage has major implications from public health point of view, understanding maternal programming of the newborn immune system could provide a basis for interventions promoting child health by implementing MDA campaigns towards all women of childbearing age and young children in achieving the target of global elimination of LF.

ID ISLANDS; CHIKUNGUNYA
AB As tourism is the mainstay of the Maldives' economy, this country recognizes the importance of controlling mosquito-borne diseases in an environmentally responsible manner. This study sought to estimate the economic costs of dengue in this Small Island Developing State of 417,492 residents. The authors reviewed relevant available documents on dengue epidemiology and conducted site visits and interviews with public health offices, health centers, referral hospitals, health insurers, and drug distribution organizations. An average of 1,543 symptomatic dengue cases was reported annually from 2011 through 2016. Intensive waste and water management on a resort island cost $1.60 per occupied room night. Local vector control programs on inhabited islands cost $35.93 for waste collection and $7.89 for household visits by community health workers per person per year. Ambulatory care for a dengue episode cost $49.87 at a health center, while inpatient episodes averaged $127.74 at a health center, $1,164.78 at a regional hospital, and $1,655.50 at a tertiary referral hospital. Overall, the cost of dengue illness in the Maldives in 2015 was $2,495,747 (0.06% of gross national income, GNI, or $6.10 per resident) plus $1,338,141 (0.03% of GNI or $3.27 per resident) for dengue surveillance. With tourism generating annual income of $898 and tax revenues of $119 per resident, results of an international analysis suggest that the risk of dengue lowers the country's gross annual income by $110 per resident (95% confidence interval $50 to $160) and its annual tax receipts by $14 per resident (95% confidence interval $7 to $22). Many innovative vector control efforts are affordable and could decrease future costs of dengue illness in the Maldives.

TI Tick-borne zoonoses in the Order Rickettsiales and Legionellales in
   Iran: A systematic review

   SURVEY; SMALL RUMINANTS; ACARI IXODIDAE
AB Background
   Tick-borne zoonoses in the Order Rickettsiales and Legionellales cause infections that often manifest as undifferentiated fevers that are not easy to distinguish from other causes of acute febrile illnesses clinically. This is partly attributed to difficulty in laboratory confirmation since convalescent sera, specific diagnostic reagents, and the required expertise may not be readily available. As a result, a number of tick-borne zoonoses are underappreciated resulting in unnecessary morbidity, mortality and huge economic loses. In Iran, a significant proportion of human infectious diseases are tick-borne, with anecdotal evidence suggesting that tick-borne zoonoses are widespread but underreported in the country. Epidemiological review is therefore necessary to aid in the effective control and prevention of tick-borne zonooses in Iran. The aim of this review is to provide an in-depth and comprehensive overview of anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, spotted fever group rickettsioses and coxiellosis in Iran.
   Methods
   Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, all relevant publications on tick-borne zoonoses in the Order Rickettsiales and Legionellales in Iran were searched using a number of search terms. The search was confined to authentic resources from repositories of popular data bases among them PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Science Direct, SpringerLink and SCOPUS. The search items included peer reviewed journals, books and book chapters published between 1996 and 2017.
   Results
   A total of 1 205 scientific publications and reports were sourced, of which 63 met the search criteria and were reviewed. Of the 63 articles reviewed, 36 (57.1%) reported on coxiellosis, 15 (23.8%) on anaplasmosis, 11 (17.5%) on ehrlichiosis and 1 (1.6%) on spotted fever group rickettsiae in a large scale study involving four countries, among them Iran. The existence of tick-borne pathogens in the Order Rickettsiales and Legionellales was confirmed by molecular, serological and microscopic techniques conducted on samples obtained from sheep, cattle, goats, camels, poultry, animal products (milk and eggs), dogs, ticks and even human subjects in different parts of the country; pointing to a countrywide distribution.
   Discussion
   Based on the review, coxiellosis, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, and SFG rickettsiae can be categorized as emerging tick-borne zoonotic diseases in Iran given the presence of their causiative agents (C. burnetii, A. phagocytophilum, A. marginale, A. bovis, A. ovis, A. central, E. canis, E. ewingii, E. chaffeensis and R. conorii) collectively reported in a variety of domestic animals, animal products, arthropods and human beings drawn from 22 provinces in Iran.
   Conclusion
   Given the asymptomatic nature of some of these zoonoses, there is a high likelihood of silent transmission to humans in many parts of the country, which should be considered a public health concern. Presently, information on the transmission intensity of tick-borne zoonoses caused by pathogens in the Order Rickettsiales and Legionellales to humans and its public health impact in Iran is scanty.

TI Misconceptions and paradoxes in soil-transmitted helminthiases control
   as a public health problem
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English

ID ASCARIS-LUMBRICOIDES; EFFICACY; HOOKWORM; ALBENDAZOLE; PREVALENCE;
   INTENSITY
AB Soil-transmitted helminthiases (STHs) constitute a public health problem that requires immediate action to resolve the morbidity of those harboring the parasites in their guts, to prevent infection in all those at risk, and to interrupt the vicious circle of poverty and disease in the affected communities, structural poverty being the main determinant of this group of infectious diseases. Since the times of the Rockefeller initiatives over a hundred years ago, the strategy has been viewed as one requiring community-wide efforts rather than pure individual case management. The World Health Organization (WHO) and its regional offices, as the governing institutions endorsed by the countries and their governments, have been the leaders in stating the actual executive measures to reach the goals and endpoints for the management of the problem. With the task of setting a group of activities that could be launched, monitored, and measured, these actions were established with the available resources since this public health problem had to be launched immediately, resources were those available at the moment and not those appearing on a wish list. Considerable progress has been made in the establishment of policies for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), later followed by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through WHO-lead actions for the control of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). With an initial goal of morbidity control, there are already discussions and proposals for elimination of STH if support is sustained and empiric facts confirm data emerging from modeling and small-scale studies. The aim of these comments is to describe and question instances of currently accepted concepts, theories, and practices that conform to the dogmatic status quo that serves as the foundation on top of which the new elimination aspirations are supposed to be built on, which might not be serving the desired purpose if taken unrevised.

TI Chagas disease mortality in Brazil: A Bayesian analysis of
   age-period-cohort effects and forecasts for two decades
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES

DT Article

   INFECTION; BURDEN; RISK
AB Background
   Chagas disease (CD) is a neglected chronic parasitic infection and a public health problem that is preventable, and has serious complications. In this study, the effects of age, period and birth cohort (APC Effects) on the evolution of the mortality of that disease in Brazil, from 1980-2014, according to sex and geographic region of the country, were analyzed. Mortality forecasts from the years 2015 to 2034 were estimated.
   Methods
   This is an ecological cross-sectional study in which death records and population data were extracted from the DATASUS (Department of Information Technology of the National Health System) website, in age groups from 20-24 years of age to 80 years and over, from 1980 to 2014. The rates were standardized according to age and sex distributions using the direct method. The APC models were estimated using the Bayesian approach, and the INLA (Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations) method was used for parameter inference. Super dispersion of the data was considered, and we included unstructured random terms in the models.
   Results
   During the analyzed period, there were 178,823 deaths in Brazil (3.85 annual deaths per 100,000 inhabitants). It was found that temporal effects on CD mortality varied by sex and region. In general, there was an increase in mortality rates up to 30 years of age, and the mortality rates were higher between 50 and 64 years of age. On average, men died five years younger than women. Mortality rates were highest in the Central West and Southeast regions. The Central West, Southeast and Southern regions had a reduction over time in the rate of CD deaths between 2000 and 2014. The mortality rate in the Northeast was not statistically different in any period analyzed, while the North had tendency to increase; however, a significant risk increase was only observed between 1995 and 1999. The rate of mortality was high in older birth cohorts. The overall prediction for the next two decades showed a progressive decline in CD mortality, which will be highest among the young. The expected average reduction was 76.1% compared to the last observed period (2010-2014) and the last predicted (2030-2034) period. The average reduction ranged from 86% in the 20-24 age group to 50% in the 80 and over age group.
   Conclusions
   In the present study, a higher death rate was observed for ages above 30 years, especially 50 to 64 years, and in the older birth cohorts. We believe these results can be related to period effects of vector control actions and preventive and care measures by the health system of Brazil, in addition to demographic changes in the period. The differences among the regions reflect socioeconomic inequities and access to the healthcare systems in the Brazilian population.

TI Human rabies in Cote d'Ivoire 2014-2016: Results following
   reinforcements to rabies surveillance
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID POSTEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS; ABIDJAN
AB In Cote d'Ivoire, rabies is endemic and remains largely uncontrolled. The numbers of human exposures and rabies cases are unknown and are probably much higher than reported. Data on human rabies cases are collected by the National Institute of Public Health (NIPH) Anti-rabies Center in Abidjan through a network of 28 NIPH local units, which cover the population of the entire country. During 2014, the NIPH initiated a program to reinforce the human rabies surveillance system in those 28 NIPH local units, with specific goals of improving the infrastructure, training, communication, and government involvement. Here, we report the progress and findings during 2014-2016. The reinforced system recorded 50 cases of human rabies (15-18 cases/year; annual incidence = 0.06-0.08 per 100,000) and more than 30,000 animal exposures (annual incidence = 41.8-48.0 per 100,000). Almost one-half of the human rabies cases were in children <= 15 years old. All were fatal and dog bites were the most common route by which rabies virus was transmitted. In the 32 cases where samples of sufficient quality for analysis were available, rabies was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR. Post-exposure prophylaxis with rabies vaccine was administered to all animal exposure victims presenting at the NIPH local units, although only about 57% completed the full immunization schedule. All available reports were provided by the NIPH local units, indicating effective communication between them and the NIPH Anti-rabies Center. These findings indicate that the reinforcements resulted in highly specific detection of human rabies, provided detailed epidemiological data about these cases, and improved estimates of animal exposure numbers. These represent substantial advances, but further improvements to the surveillance system are needed to increase disease awareness and capture cases that are currently missed by the system. In the future, better communication between local health centers and the NIPH units, surveillance at the local health center level, and increased veterinarian engagement will help provide a more complete picture of the rabies burden in Cote d'Ivoire.

AB Background
   The study presents estimates for the burden of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (CML) in Brazil and its 27 federated units using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2016.
   Methodology
   We report the incidence, years of life lost (YLL), years lived with disability (YLD), and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) for leishmaniasis in Brazil from 1990 to 2016. The metrics are presented as age-standardized rates per 100,000 inhabitants with their respective uncertainty intervals (95%UI) and relative percentages of change.
   Principal findings
   The age-standardized incidence rate of leishmaniasis decreased 48.5% from 1990 (71.0, 95%U124.3-150.7) to 2016 (36.5, 95%U124.7-50.9), whereas the age-standardized DALY increased 83.6% over the studied period from 12.2 (95%U17.9-18.8) to 22.4 (95%U113.336.2). The age-standardized incidence rate and YLL for VL increased by 52.9% and 108% from 1990 to 2016, respectively. Considering CML, the age-standardized incidence rate and YLD decreased by 51% and 31.8% respectively for the same period. For VL, similar profiles for male and female were observed, with YLL and DALY increasing over time; with males presenting slightly higher values. The highest YLL rates were among "under 1-year old" children, which increased 131.2% from 1990 to 2016. Regarding CML, the highest values of YLD and DALY were verified among males, and YLD values showed a similar profile, with rates increasing with age. The VL burden increased in some states in the Northeast and Southeast regions and decreased for CML in some Northern states.
   Conclusion
   The increase of VL burden over the study period might be associated with the difficulties in controlling the disease spread. Information regarding the weight of VL and CML, including the death and disability tolls that they cause, highlights the impact of these neglected diseases on public health and the importance of effective prevention and treatment.

TI A Delphi consultation to assess indicators of readiness to provide
   quality health facility-based lymphoedema management services
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID RELIABILITY; EXERCISE
AB Background
   The World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration with partners is developing a toolkit of resources to guide lymphatic filariasis (LF) morbidity management and disability prevention (MMDP) implementation and evaluation. Direct health facility inspection is the preferred method for documenting the readiness of a country programme to provide quality lymphoedema management services, one of the three MMDP criteria used to demonstrate the elimination of LF as a public health problem.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   As component of tool development, a Delphi consultation was implemented to gain consensus on six proposed domains and fourteen proposed tracer indicators to measure national programme readiness to provide quality health facility-based lymphoedema management services. A seven-point Likert-type scale was used to rank the importance of proposed domains and tracer indicators. Consensus for inclusion of the indicator was defined a priori as 70% or more of respondents ranking the proposed indicator in the top three tiers (5-7). Purposive sampling was used to select 43 representative experts including country representatives, programme implementers, and technical experts. A 55.8% response rate (n = 24) was achieved for the survey. Analysis of the responses demonstrated that consensus for inclusion had been reached for all proposed domains including trained staff (mean = 6.9, standard deviation (SD) = 0.34), case management and education materials (mean = 6.1, SD = 0.65), water infrastructure (mean = 6.3, SD = 0.81), medicines and commodities (mean = 6.3, SD = 0.69), patient tracking system (mean = 6.3, SD = 0.85), and staff knowledge (mean = 6.5, SD = 0.66).
   Significance
   The Delphi consultation provided an efficient and structured method for gaining consensus among lymphatic filariasis experts around key lymphoedema management quality indicators. The results from this analysis were used to refine the indicators included within the direct inspection protocol tool to ensure its ability to assess health facility readiness to provide quality lymphoedema management services.

AB Background
   Participants in mass gathering events are at risk of acquiring imported and locally endemic infectious diseases. The 2014 dengue outbreak in Tokyo gathered attention since it was the first time in 70 years for Japan to experience an autochthonous transmission. Preparation for emerging infectious threats is essential even in places where these outbreaks have been largely unknown. The aim of this study is to identify strategies for early detection and prevention of dengue infection during the 2020 summer Olympics and Paralympics in Tokyo.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   We modified and adapted the failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) methodology, generally used in industrial manufacturing, to examine the current controls for dengue detection and assessment. Information on existing controls were obtained from publicly available resources. Our analysis revealed that the national infectious disease control system to detect dengue in Japan is robust. However, in the case of large assemblies of international visitors for special events when the spread of communicable and vector-borne diseases increases, there are three main gaps that could be reinforced. First, cyclical training or a certification program on tropical disease management is warranted for physicians, especially those working in non-infectious disease-designated hospitals or clinics. Second, multi-language communication methods need to be strengthened especially in the health and hospitality sector. Third, owners of accommodations should consider incorporating a formal tropical disease-training program for their staff members and have a contingency plan for infectious disease-suspected travelers.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Our findings may facilitate physicians and public health officials where new controls would be beneficial for the 2020 summer Olympics and Paralympics. The FMEA framework has the potential to be applied to other infectious diseases, not just dengue.

AB The emergence and re-emergence of pathogens remains a major public health concern. Unfortunately, when and where pathogens will (re-)emerge is notoriously difficult to predict, as the erratic nature of those events is reinforced by the stochastic nature of pathogen evolution during the early phase of an epidemic. For instance, mutations allowing pathogens to escape host resistance may boost pathogen spread and promote emergence. Yet, the ecological factors that govern such evolutionary emergence remain elusive because of the lack of ecological realism of current theoretical frameworks and the difficulty of experimentally testing their predictions. Here, we develop a theoretical model to explore the effects of the heterogeneity of the host population on the probability of pathogen emergence, with or without pathogen evolution. We show that evolutionary emergence and the spread of escape mutations in the pathogen population is more likely to occur when the host population contains an intermediate proportion of resistant hosts. We also show that the probability of pathogen emergence rapidly declines with the diversity of resistance in the host population. Experimental tests using lytic bacteriophages infecting their bacterial hosts containing Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat and CRISPR-associated (CRISPR-Cas) immune defenses confirm these theoretical predictions. These results suggest effective strategies for cross-species spillover and for the management of emerging infectious diseases.

TI Community delivery of antiretroviral drugs: A non-inferiority
   cluster-randomized pragmatic trial in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania
SO PLOS MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID CARE; POPULATION; FACILITY; AFRICA; NEEDS
AB Background
   With the increase in people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa and expanding eligibility criteria for antiretroviral therapy (ART), there is intense interest in the use of novel delivery models that allow understaffed health systems to successfully deal with an increasing demand for antiretroviral drugs (ARVs). This pragmatic randomized controlled trial in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, evaluated a novel model of ARV community delivery: lay health workers (home-based carers [HBCs]) deliver ARVs to the homes of patients who are clinically stable on ART, while nurses and physicians deliver standard facility-based care for patients who are clinically unstable. Specifically, the trial aimed to assess whether the ARV community delivery model performed at least equally well in averting virological failure as the standard of care (facility-based care for all ART patients).
   Methods and findings
   The study took place from March 1, 2016, to October 27, 2017. All (48) healthcare facilities in Dar es Salaam that provided ART and had an affiliated team of public-sector HBCs were randomized 1: 1 to either (i) ARV community delivery (intervention) or (ii) the standard of care (control). Our prespecified primary endpoint was the proportion of adult non-pregnant ART patients with virological failure at the end of the study period. The prespecified margin of non-inferiority was a risk ratio (RR) of 1.45. The mean follow-up period was 326 days. We obtained intent-to-treat (ITT) RRs using a log-binomial model adjusting standard errors for clustering at the level of the healthcare facility. A total of 2,172 patients were enrolled at intervention (1,163 patients) and control (1,009 patients) facilities. Of the 1,163 patients in the intervention arm, 516 (44.4%) were both clinically stable on ART and opted to receive ARVs in their homes or at another meeting point of their choosing in the community. At the end of the study period, 10.9% (95/872) of patients in the control arm and 9.7% (91/943) in the intervention arm were failing virologically. The ITT RR for virological failure demonstrated non-inferiority of the ARV community delivery model (RR 0.89 [1-sided 95% CI 0.00 +/- 1.18]). We observed no significant difference between study arms in self-reported patient healthcare expenditures over the last 6 months before study exit. Of those who received ARVs in the community, 97.2% (95% CI 94.7% +/- 98.7%) reported being either "satisfied" or "very satisfied" with the program. Other than loss to follow-up (18.9% in the intervention and 13.6% in the control arm), the main limitation of this trial was that substantial decongestion of healthcare facilities was not achieved, thus making the logic for our preregistered ITT approach (which includes those ineligible to receive ARVs at home in the intervention sample) less compelling.
   Conclusions
   In this study, an ARV community delivery model performed at least as well as the standard of care regarding the critical health indicator of virological failure. The intervention did not significantly reduce patient healthcare expenditures, but satisfaction with the program was high and it is likely to save patients time. Policy-makers should consider piloting, evaluating, and scaling more ambitious ARV community delivery programs that can reach higher proportions of ART patients.

AB Background: Chronic widespread pain (CWP) is a major public health problem. Many people experiencing CWP experience mental health problems such as anxiety or depression. Complete relief of skeletal and body pain symptoms is unlikely but with appropriate treatment the impact upon quality of life, functioning and mental health symptoms can be reduced. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is widely used for a range of health conditions and can have short and long-term improvements in patients with CWP. This research aimed to explore, from a professional stakeholder perspective, the implementation of a local Pain Platform offering a stepped care approach for interventions including telephone delivered CBT (T-CBT).
   Methods: Fourteen professional stakeholders holding various roles across primary and secondary care services within the Pain Platform took part in semi-structured interviews. Their views and experiences of the implementation of the Pain Platform were explored. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed according to Normalisation Process Theory (NPT).
   Results: Professional stakeholders were positive about the Pain Platform and its potential to overcome previously identified existing access issues to psychological interventions for CWP patients. It was considered a valuable part of ensuring that patients' preferences and needs are more readily addressed. In some circumstances, however, introducing psychological interventions to patients was considered challenging and the introduction of new referral processes was raised concerns. To ensure sustainability more work is required to reduce professional isolation and ensure efficient referral procedures between primary and secondary care services are established to reduce concerns over issues related to clinical governance and potential risk to patient.
   Conclusions: The findings provide professional insight into the key challenges of introducing a Pain Platform incorporating psychological support across primary and secondary care services within a local service. These included development of sustainable procedures and closer working relationships. Areas requiring future development are identified.

AB Background: Evidence suggests that the media can influence societal attitudes and beliefs to various social issues. This influence is especially strong for mental health issues, particularly suicide. As such, the aim of this study is to systematically examine Canadian newspaper coverage of the popular fictional Netflix series 13 Reasons Why, wherein the lead character dies by suicide in the final episode.
   Methods: Articles mentioning the series were systematically collected from best-selling Canadian newspapers in the three-month period following series release (April-June 2017). Articles were coded for adherence to key best practice recommendations on how to sensitively report suicide. Frequency counts and proportions were produced. An inductive qualitative thematic analysis was then undertaken to identify common themes within the articles.
   Results: A total of 71 articles met study inclusion criteria. The majority of articles did not mention the suicide method (88.7%) and did not use stigmatizing language such as 'commit suicide' (84.5%). Almost half of the articles linked suicide to wider social issues (43.7%) or quoted a mental health professional (45.1%). 25% included information telling others considering suicide where to get help. Our qualitative analysis indicated that articles simultaneously praised and criticized the series. It was praised for (i) promoting dialogue and discussion about youth suicide; (ii) raising awareness of youth suicide issues; (iii) shining a spotlight on wider social issues that may affect suicide. It was criticized for (i) glorifying suicide, (ii) harmfully impacting young viewers; (iii) prompting pushback from educators and schools.
   Conclusions: Newspaper coverage of '13 Reasons Why' generally adhered to core best practice media recommendations, and sensitively discussed suicide from various angles, prompting productive discussion and dialogue about youth suicide. These findings suggest that the media can be an ally in promoting dialogue and raising awareness of important public health issues such as suicide.

AB Background: There is evidence that uric acid may have antioxidant and neuroprotective effects and might therefore alter the risk for neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia. So far, the relation between serum uric acid (SUA) levels or hyperuricemia and dementia remains elusive. Most studies focused on the disease or SUA levels. Effects of anti-hyperuricemic treatment have not been considered yet. This study investigated the association between hyperuricemia and dementia taking into account anti-hyperuricemic treatment.
   Methods: We used longitudinal German public health insurance data and analyzed the association between hyperuricemia with and without different treatment options and dementia in a case-control design. Applying logistic regression the analysis was adjusted for several potential confounders including various comorbidities and polypharmacy.
   Results: We identified 27,528 cases and 110,112 matched controls of which 22% had a diagnosis of hyperuricemia or gout and 17% received anti-hyperuricemic drugs. For patients with a diagnosis of hyperuricemia we found a slightly reduced risk for dementia (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89 to 0.98). The risk reduction was more pronounced for patients treated with anti-hyperuricemic drugs (adjusted OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.94, for regular treatment).
   Conclusions: Our results showed a slight reduction for dementia risk in patients with hyperuricemia, both with and without anti-hyperuricemic treatment.

TI 'We pledge to improve the health of our entire community': Improving
   health worker motivation and performance in Bihar, India through
   teamwork, recognition, and non- financial incentives
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   Motivation is critical to health worker performance and work quality. In Bihar, India, frontline health workers provide essential health services for the state's poorest citizens. Yet, there is a shortfall of motivated and skilled providers and a lack of coordination between two cadres of frontline health workers and their supervisors. CARE India developed an approach aimed at improving health workers' performance by shifting work culture and strengthening teamwork and motivation. The intervention-qeam-Based Goals and Incentives"-supported health workers to work as teams towards collective goals and rewarded success with public recognition and non-financial incentives.
   Methods
   Thirty months after initiating the intervention, 885 health workers and 98 supervisors completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire in 38 intervention and 38 control health sub-centers in one district. The questionnaire included measures of social cohesion, teamwork attitudes, self-efficacy, job satisfaction, teamwork behaviors, equitable service delivery, taking initiative, and supervisory support. We conducted bivariate analyses to examine the impact of the intervention on these psychosocial and behavioral outcomes.
   Results
   Results show statistically significant differences across several measures between intervention and control frontline health workers, including improved teamwork (mean = 8.8 vs. 7.3), empowerment (8.5 vs. 7.4), job satisfaction (7.1 vs. 5.99) and equitable service delivery (6.7 vs. 4.99). While fewer significant differences were found for supervisors, they reported improved teamwork (8.4 vs. 5.3), and frontline health workers reported improved fulfillment of supervisory duties by their supervisors (8.9 vs. 7.6). Both frontline health workers and supervisors found public recognition and enhanced teamwork more motivating than the non-financial incentives.
   Conclusions
   The Team-Based Goals and Incentives model reinforces intrinsic motivation and supports improvements in the teamwork, motivation, and performance of health workers. It offers an approach to practitioners and governments for improving the work environment in a resource-constrained setting and where there are multiple cadres of health workers.

TI Analysis of induced abortion-related complications in women admitted to
   referral health facilities in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID UNSAFE ABORTION; MATERNAL MORTALITY; POSTABORTION CARE; RISK-FACTORS;
   COUNTRY; NIGERIA; AGE
AB Background
   Due to a lack of relevant data on induced abortions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), as well as the persistence of maternal deaths in the country, this study aims to analyze the extent and characteristics of induced abortion-related complications in women who were admitted to referral health facilities in Kinshasa, including the duration of hospitalization, the mortality rate due to induced abortion complications and their characteristics, and the deaths that occurred after two days of hospitalization.
   Methods
   This is a cross-sectional study on 843 obstetric and gynecological patients who were admitted as emergency cases to five referral health facilities in Kinshasa during 2014. These facilities were selected as being representative of five types of districts in Kinshasa, according to their cultural, socioeconomic, and infrastructural characteristics. Patient data were collected from patient records and analyzed.
   Results
   From the 843 patients admitted to receive obstetric and gynecological emergency care services in 2014 at the health facilities surveyed, 14.7% (95% CI: 12.4-17.3%) had complications due to induced abortion. These complications were significantly diagnosed in adolescents (p = 0.003) and in single, separated, divorced, or widowed women (p = 0.03). The median duration of hospitalization was nine days, and this period of time was significantly longer for the patients who underwent surgery for pelvic peritonitis due to uterine perforation compared with the patients who underwent Caesarean section/hysterectomy. Furthermore, it was significantly longer for the patients who were treated for other induced-abortion related complications compared with patients treated for spontaneous abortion. The mortality rate related to induced abortions was 5.6% (95% CI: 2.3-11.3%), with an increase in risk of death in the presence of a postabortive pelvic peritonitis-type complication; 42.9% of deaths occurred after two days of hospitalization.
   Conclusion
   The complications of induced abortions are a major public health problem due to their frequency among patients admitted to Kinshasa's referral health facilities, their mortality, and their poor medical management. Therefore, there is a need to understand the reason for its poor medical management in order to provide an adequate intervention program.

TI Qualitative assessment of facilitators and barriers to HIV programme
   implementation by community health workers in Mopani district, South
   Africa
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MODEL; CARE
AB South Africa has implemented a community-based HIV programme (CBHP) in its primary healthcare (PHC) re-engineering strategy that aims to improve public healthcare delivery. This CBHP is delivered by ward-based outreach teams (WBOTs); provision of community HIV services comprises an important component of this programme. We conducted an exploratory study to determine the facilitators and barriers to successful implementation of this CBHP in rural Mopani District, South Africa. Focus group discussions were conducted with the community health workers (CHWs) and PHC nurses; participant interviews were conducted with community members who access these health services, community leaders, and social workers. We conducted a thematic content analysis and based on the key themes reported, we identified the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, consisting of five domains, as the most appropriate model to interpret our findings. First, in terms of intervention characteristics, community members generally valued the HIV services provided, but the variable needs impacted on programme implementation. Outer setting challenges include inability to meet the need of patients as a result of stigma, nondisclosure of HIV status and social factors. In terms of the inner setting, CHWs were grateful for the equipment and training received but expressed the need for better support of management and the provision of additional resources. With regard to characteristics of the implementers, the CHWs expressed the desire for further training despite reporting having sufficient knowledge to conduct their HIV work. Finally, in terms of the implementation process, the importance of relationship building between CHWs and community members was emphasised. In conclusion, these data underline the positive receipt and potential of the CBHP in this rural district and identify areas to further strengthen the programme. The success and sustainability of the CBHP requires ongoing commitment of resources, training, supervision, and organisational support in order to operate effectively and efficiently.

   RESISTANCE; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; CHILDREN; ASSAY; METAANALYSIS
AB Background
   Diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) in infants is challenging due to non-specific clinical presentations of the disease in this age-group and low sensitivity of widely available TB diagnostic tools, which in turn delays prompt access to TB treatment. Upfront access to Xpert/MTB RIF (Xpert) testing, a highly sensitive and specific rapid diagnostic tool, could potentially address some of these challenges. Under the current project, we assessed the utility and feasibility of applying upfront Xpert for diagnosis of tuberculosis in infants, including for testing of nonsputum specimens.
   Methods
   A high throughput lab was established in each of the four project cities, and linked to various health care providers across the city, through rapid specimen transportation and electronic reporting linkages. Free Xpert testing was offered to all infant (<2 years of age) presumptive TB cases (both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary) seeking care at public and private health facilities.
   Results
   A total of 7,994 presumptive infant TB cases were enrolled in the project from April 2014 to October 2016, detecting 465 (5.8%, CI: 5.3-6.4) TB cases. The majority (93.9%; CI: 93.4-94.4) of patient specimens were non-sputum and TB positivity was higher amongst non- sputum specimens. Further, a high proportion (5.6% CI 3.8-8.1) of infant TB cases were found to be rifampicin resistant. Covering large cities with a single lab per city over more than two years, the project demonstrated the feasibility of same-day diagnosis with upfront Xpert testing. This in turn led to prompt treatment initiation, with a two-day median turnaround time to treatment initiation. Case mortality observed in the project cohort of diagnosed TB cases was 11.0% (CI 8.4-14.1), the majority of which was pre- or early treatment mortality, in spite of prompt access to treatment for most diagnosed cases.
   Conclusion
   The current project demonstrated the feasibility of applying rapid and upfront Xpert testing for presumptive infant TB cases. Rapid TB diagnosis in turn facilitates prompt and appropriate treatment initiation. Further, levels of rifampicin resistance observed in infants TB cases highlight the additional benefit of upfront resistance testing. However, high rates of early case mortality, in spite of prompt diagnosis and treatment initiation, highlight the need for further research in infant patient pathways for overall improvement in TB care for infant populations.

   vulval cancer treatment and survival
SO BMC CANCER

DE Vulval cancer stage treatment survival
ID UNITED-STATES; TRENDS; CARCINOMA; PERSPECTIVE; RATES; WOMEN
AB Background: The value of hospital registries for describing treatment and survival outcomes for vulval cancer was investigated. Hospital registry data from four major public hospitals in 1984-2016 were used because populationbased data lacked required treatment and outcomes data. Unlike population registries, the hospital registries had recorded FIGO stage, grade and treatment.
   Methods: Unadjusted and adjusted disease-specific survival and multiple logistic regression were used. Diseasespecific survivals were explored using Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimates. Hazards ratios (HRs) were obtained from proportional hazards regression for 1984-1999 and 2000-2016. Repeat analyses were undertaken using competing risk regression.
   Results: Five-year disease-specific survival was 70%, broadly equivalent to the five-year relative survivals reported for Australia overall (70%), the United Kingdom (70%), USA (72%), Holland (70%), and Germany (Munich) (68%). Unadjusted five-year survival tended to be lower for cancers diagnosed in 2000-2016 than 1984-1999, consistent with survival trends reported for the USA and Canada, but higher for 2000-2016 than 1984-1999 after adjusting for stage and other covariates, although differences were small and did not approach statistical significance (p >= 0.40). Surgery was provided as part of the primary course of treatment for 94% of patients and radiotherapy for 26%, whereas chemotherapy was provided for only 6%. Less extensive surgical procedures applied in 2000-2016 than 1984-1999 and the use of chemotherapy increased over these periods. Surgery was more common for early FIGO stages, and radiotherapy for later stages with a peak for stage III. Differences in treatment by surgery and radiotherapy were not found by geographic measures of remoteness and socioeconomic status in adjusted analyses, suggesting equity in service delivery.
   Conclusions: The data illustrate the complementary value of hospital-registry data to population-registry data for informing local providers and health administrations of trends in management and outcomes, in this instance for a comparatively rare cancer that is under-represented in trials and under-reported in national statistics. Hospital registries can fill an evidence gap when clinical data are lacking in population-based registries.

AB Background: Malnutrition in older persons is a public health concern. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of malnutrition and its associated factors among community-dwelling older persons in Sri Lanka.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Kandy district,Sri Lanka. The nutritional status of older persons was assessed using the Mini Nutritional Assessment - Short Form (MNASF). A standardised questionnaire was used to record factors associated with malnutrition: demographic characteristics, financial characteristics, food and appetite, lifestyle, psychological characteristics, physical characteristics, disease and care, oral health, and social factors. Complex sample multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed.
   Results: Among the 999 participants included in the study, 748 (69.3%) were females and 251 (25.1%) were males. The mean age was 70.80 years (95% CI: 70.13, 71.47). The prevalence of malnutrition, risk of malnutrition and well-nutrition was 12.5%, 52.4% and 35.1% respectively. In the multivariate model, hypertension (adjusted OR = 1.71; 95% CI: 1.02, 2. 89), alcohol consumption (aOR = 4.06; 95% CI: 1.17, 14.07), and increased age (aOR = 1.06; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.11) were positively associated with malnutrition. An increased number of people living with the older person (aOR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.85, 0.97) was a protective factor among those at risk for malnutrition.
   Conclusion: Both the prevalence of malnutrition and risk of malnutrition were commonly observed among community-dwelling older persons in Sri Lanka. The associated factors identified in this study might help public health professionals to implement necessary interventions that improve the nutritional status of this population.

AB Background: Psittacosis outbreak investigations require rapid identification of cases in order to trace possible sources and perform public health risk assessments. In recent outbreaks in the Netherlands, such investigations were hampered by the non-specificity of laboratory testing methods to identify human Chlamydia psittaci infections.
   Method: A systematic search of PubMed and Scopus databases of literature published between 01 January, 1986 and 03 July, 2017 was done to find best practices of laboratory-testing methods used in psittacosis outbreaks of two or more human cases. Reference lists of included articles were hand searched to identify additional articles.
   Results: Thirty-seven eligible articles were identified, describing 44 human psittacosis outbreaks in 12 countries. Laboratory tests performed were PCR (with various targets), serologic tests (complement binding reactions, ELISA's, immunofluorescence tests and immuno-peroxidase tests) and culture, in various combinations. The literature provided no 'gold standard' laboratory testing strategy to identify recent human C. psittaci infections. In most psittacosis outbreaks, for a considerable number of cases (or tested individuals in an exposed cohort), C. psittaci infection could not be confirmed, nor excluded as causative pathogen. None of the testing strategies was found to be suitable for (nearly) full case finding.
   Conclusion: PCR enables rapid identification of human psittacosis patients and helps source finding by genotyping but has the disadvantage that sensitivity is high only in the acute phase. In outbreak situations, there is often a time delay and therefore, there is a need for new serologic testing methods next to PCR, with good specificity and sensitivity. Moreover, serum is easier to collect than the preferred diagnostic materials for PCR. A serologic test that can reliably confirm infection status without the necessity of convalescent serum sampling would enhance case finding, source tracing, identification of risk factors and assessment of burden of disease in various settings.

AB Aim
   Infections with carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) are among the most frequent complications in the immunocompromised cancer patients because of their considerable morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to characterize the prevalence of carbapenemase-producing GNB recovered from febrile neutropenic pediatric cancer patients in Egypt.
   Methods
   Standard methods were used for identification, sensitivity testing (Kirby-Bauer and broth microdilution method according to CLSI guidelines). Standard methods were applied for both phenotypic and genotypic detection of the carbapenemase-producing GNB.
   Results
   A total of 185 GNB were recovered from different clinical specimens, Escherichia (E.) coli (86; 46.48%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (71; 38.37%), Acinetobacter (A.) baumannii (7; 3.78%) and others including Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter (Ent.) cloacae and Proteus spp. (21; 11.35%). It is a matter of concern that 116 out of 171 enterobacterial isolates (94.15%) showed resistance to three or more antimicrobial classes and were considered multidrug resistant. Additionally, the rate of carbapenem-resistance displayed a worrisome trend as 113 out of 171 enterobacterial isolates (66.08%) and 12 out of 14 non fermenting bacilli (85.71%) showed resistance pattern to at least one of the tested carbapenems. After performing a series of phenotypic tests for initial screening of potential carbapenemase producers, molecular characterization to the 29 extracted plasmids were subjected to PCR using 5 common carbapenemase primers). The results revealed that bla(OXA-48) was the most prevalent 17 (58.62%), followed by bla(NDM) 8(27.58%), then bla(VIM) 3 (10.3%) and bla(KPC) 2 (6.89%).
   Conclusion
   These results are an alarming threat to public health that calls for urgent application of antimicrobial stewardship programs along with routine surveillance for controlling outbreaks.

AB Background: Since the 1980s, a wide variety of methods have been proposed to measure dental caries in the population, demonstrating a lack of consensus regarding the procedure that should be used for this purpose. The current study investigated the methods that are known and used by public oral health researchers and professors as well as the reasons that lead to the choice of a particular method.
   Method: In the context of an interview, a questionnaire was administered to public oral health researchers and professors who used caries indices and worked in Salvador and Feira de Santana, Bahia, Brazil from 2005 to 2015. A quantitative and descriptive approach was applied that adopted the multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) technique to assess the associations among responses.
   Results: The decayed, missing, and filled index (DMF) was the only measurement known by all respondents, and although 45 of the 47 professors/researchers were dissatisfied with this index, only six had used other methods. This index was chosen because of its comparability and ease of application. The MCA revealed response associations among older, male participants who graduated from the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA) and who continued to use this index because of its comparability and because it is the index recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MS). Another group was also observed that consisted of younger females who graduated from the State University of Feira de Santana (UEFS) or another university and who used the DMF because it is well-known, simple, and easy to apply.
   Conclusions: The DMF index was the most known and used method. Many respondents demonstrated a desire for change and were critical of the DMF; however, they did not know of and had not used newer methods for measuring dental caries. Greater importance should be placed on the problem of dental caries assessment in the population.

AB Background: Mental health issues in children have become a serious public health concern in the U.S. within the past few decades. Emerging evidence suggests that Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) can be beneficial for various mental health issues. However, little is known about the prevalence, reasons, and associated factors of CAM use among this population in the U.S. The purpose of this study is to examine the characteristics of CAM use among U.S. children with mental health issues.
   Methods: Utilizing the 2012 National Health Interview Survey data, we used descriptive analysis, Wald F-statistics, and multivariable survey logistic regression models to examine the prevalence, patterns, and associated factors of CAM use in children aged 4-17 (n = 10,233) adjusting for the complex sampling design.
   Results: CAM use is more popular among children with mental health issues compared with those without (19.2% vs. 10.1%, p < 0.001). Herbal remedies (9.1%), mind-body therapies (5.5%), and chiropractic care (5.3%) were the most frequently used modalities. Primary reasons for children to use CAM are because they are helpful (69.2%), natural (55.9%), and holistic (44.7%). The majority of CAM users perceived CAM therapies are helpful. Predictors of CAM use are children who are female, whose parents had a higher educational level and socioeconomic status, and who had at least one co-morbid medical condition. Only 18.4% of CAM usage was recommended by medical doctors.
   Conclusions: Approximately 10 million parents of children with mental health issues reported the use of CAM therapies, mainly because of their desire for a more natural and holistic healthcare approach. Given that the majority of CAM users perceived CAM therapies as helpful, future studies should investigate the unique contributions of CAM in pediatric psychiatric care. Because a low percentage of CAM use was recommended by medical doctors, educational interventions designed to equip medical professionals with CAM knowledge and experience will be conducive to improving effective patient-physician communication in clinical settings. Since CAM use is reported as more prevalent by parents' of children with higher education and family income, effective strategies designed to reduce disparities in accessing promising CAM therapies are warranted.

TI Real and predicted mortality under health spending constraints in Italy:
   a time trend analysis through artificial neural networks
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH

DT Article
DE Health expenditures; Mortality rate; Time trend analysis; Neural network

ID OUTCOMES; AUSTERITY; CRISIS; CARE
AB Background: After 2008 global economic crisis, Italian governments progressively reduced public healthcare financing. Describing the time trend of health outcomes and health expenditure may be helpful for policy makers during the resources' allocation decision making process. The aim of this paper is to analyze the trend of mortality and health spending in Italy and to investigate their correlation in consideration of the funding constraints experienced by the Italian national health system (SSN).
   Methods: We conducted a 20-year time-series study. Secondary data has been extracted from a national, institution based and publicly accessible retrospective database periodically released by the Italian Institute of Statistics. Age standardized all-cause mortality rate (MR) and health spending (Directly Provided Services - DPS, Agreed-Upon Services - TAUS, and private expenditure) were reviewed. Time trend analysis (1995-2014) through OLS and Multilayer Feed-forward Neural Networks (MFNN) models to forecast mortality and spending trend was performed. The association between healthcare expenditure and MR was analyzed through a fixed effect regression model. We then repeated MFNN time trend forecasting analyses on mortality by adding the spending item resulted significantly related with MR in the fixed effect analyses.
   Results: DPS and TAUS decreased since 2011. There was a mismatch in mortality rates between real and predicted values. DPS resulted significantly associated to mortality (p < 0.05). In repeated mortality forecasting analysis, predicted MR was found to be lower when considering the pre-constraints health spending trend.
   Conclusions: Between 2011 and 2014, Italian public health spending items showed a reduction when compared to prior years. Spending on services directly provided free of charge appears to be the financial driving force of the Italian public health system. The overall mortality was found to be higher than the predicted trend and this scenario may be partially attributable to the healthcare funding constraints experienced by the SSN.

AB Background: Child obesity is a major public health challenge, increasing the risk of chronic medical conditions such as type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and hypertension. Among U. S. states, Tennessee has one of the highest rates of child obesity. Emerging communication technologies can help to deliver highly disseminable population-level interventions to improve health behavior. The aim of this paper is to report the implementation and the evaluation of the reach of Memphis FitKids, a web-based application, intended to promote healthy behaviors for families and children.
   Methods: A community-level demonstration project, Memphis FitKids, was developed and implemented in Tennessee's Greater Memphis Area. This application (www. memphisfitkids. org) was designed for parents to assess their children's obesity risk through determinants such as weight, diet, physical activity, screen time, and sleep adequacy. A built-in "FitCheck" tool used this collected information to create a report with tailored recommendations on how to make healthy changes. A Geographic Information Systems component was implemented to suggest low-cost neighborhood resources that support a healthy lifestyle. A social marketing framework was used to develop and implement FitKids, and a Community Advisory Board with representatives from community partners (e.g., the YMCA of Memphis, the Pink Palace Family of Museums, and the Memphis Public Library) supported the implementation of the project. Five kiosks distributed in the community served as public access points to provide a broad reach across socioeconomic strata. Presentations at community events and the use of Facebook facilitated the promotion of FitKids. Website traffic and Facebook usage were evaluated with Google Analytics and Facebook Insights, respectively.
   Results: In Tennessee, 33,505 users completed 38,429 FitCheck sessions between July 2014 and December 2016. Among these, 6763 sessions were completed at the five kiosks in the community. FitKids was presented at 112 community events and the social media posts reached 23,767 unique Facebook users.
   Conclusions: The Memphis FitKids demonstration project showed that web-based health tools may be a viable strategy to increase access to information about healthy weight and lifestyle options for families. Mobile-friendly web-based applications like Memphis FitKids may also serve health professionals in their efforts to support their clients in adopting healthy behaviors.

AB Background: Candida spp. is the vital pathogen involved in mycotic mastitis of cows. However the epidemiology and infection of Candida species in mycotic mastitis of cow in Ningxia province of China has not been explored. In the present study, the epidemiology, antimicrobial susceptibility and virulence-related genes of non-albicans Candida (NAC) species were investigated.
   Methods: A total of 482 milk samples from cows with clinical mastitis in four herds of Yinchuan, Ningxia were collected and used for the isolation and identification of mastic pathogens by phenotypic and molecular characteristics, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. The antimicrobial susceptibility to antifungal agents was also determined by a disk diffusion assay. The presence of virulence-related genes was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
   Results: A total of 60 isolates from nine different Candida species were identified from 256 (60/256, 23.44%) milk samples. The most frequently identified species in cows with clinical mastitis groups were Candida krusei (n = 14) and Candida parapsilosis (n = 6). Others include Candida lipolytica, Candida lusitaniae, Ctyptococcus neoformans. But no Candida albicans was identified in this study. Interestingly, All C krusei isolates (14/14) were resistant to fluconazole, fluorocytosine, itraconazole and ketoconazole, 2 out of 14 C. krusei were resistant to amphotericin, and 8 out of the 14 were resistant to nystatin. Similarly, all six C. parapsilosis isolates were resistant to fluorocytosine, but susceptible to fluconazole, ketoconazole and nystatin; two of the six were resistant amphotericin and itraconazole. Molecularly, all of the C. parapsilosis isolates carried eight virulence-related genes, FKS1, FKS2, FKS3, SAP1, SAP2, CDR1, ERG11 and MDR1. All of the C. krusei isolates contained three virulence-related genes, ERG11, ABC2 and FKS1.
   Conclusion: These data suggested that Candida species other than C. albicans played a pathogenic role in mycotic mastitis of cows in Yinchuan, Ningxia of China. The high incidence of drug-resistant genes in C. parapsilosis and C. krusei also highlighted a great concern in public and animal health in this region.

TI Designing a framework for primary health care research in Canada: a
   scoping literature review
SO BMC FAMILY PRACTICE
LA English
DT Review
DE Primary health care; Research priorities; Research transfer; Canada
ID PREVENTION
AB Background: Despite significant investments to improve primary health care (PHC) delivery in Canada, provincial health care systems remain fragmented and uncoordinated. Canada's commitment to strengthening PHC should be driven by robust research and evaluation that reflects our health policy priorities and responds to the needs of the population. One challenge facing health services researchers is developing and sustaining meaningful research priorities and agendas in an overburdened, complex health care system with limited capacity for PHC research and support for clinician researchers.
   Methods: A scoping review of the literature was conducted to examine PHC research priorities in Canada. We compared national research priorities for PHC to research priorities being considered in the province of Alberta. Our scoping review was guided by the following questions: (1) What are the research priorities for PHC in Canada?; and (2) What process is used to identity PHC research priorities?
   Results: Six key theme areas for consideration in setting a PHC research agenda were identified: research in practice, research on practice, research about practice, methods of priority setting, infrastructure, and the intersection of PHC and population/public health. These thematic areas provide a new framework for guiding PHC research in Canada. It was developed to generate best practices and new knowledge (i.e., innovation), transform PHC clinical practice or support quality improvement (i.e., spread), and lead to large-scale health care system transformation (i.e., scale).
   Conclusions: Priority-driven research aims to answer questions of key importance that are likely to have a significant impact on knowledge or practice in the short to medium term. Setting PHC research priorities ensures funded research has the greatest potential population health benefit, that research funding and outputs are aligned with the needs of practitioners and decision makers, and that there is efficient and equitable use of limited resources with less duplication of research effort. Our findings also suggest that a common research priority framework for PHC research in Canada would ensure that research priority-setting exercises are grounded in an evidence-based process.

AB Background: The UK, like a number of other countries, has a refugee resettlement programme. External factors, such as higher prevalence of infectious diseases in the country of origin and circumstances of travel, are likely to increase the infectious disease risk of refugees, but published data is scarce. The International Organization for Migration carries out and collates data on standardised pre-entry health assessments (HA), including testing for infectious diseases, on all UK refugee applicants as part of the resettlement programme. From this data, we report the yield of selected infectious diseases (tuberculosis (TB), HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B and hepatitis C) and key risk factors with the aim of informing public health policy.
   Methods: We examined a large cohort of refugees (n = 18,418) who underwent a comprehensive pre-entry HA between March 2013 and August 2017. We calculated yields of infectious diseases stratified by nationality and compared these with published (mostly WHO) estimates. We assessed factors associated with case positivity in univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis.
   Results: The number of refugees included in the analysis varied by disease (range 8506-9759). Overall yields were notably high for hepatitis B (188 cases; 2.04%, 95% CI 1.77-235%), while yields were below 1% for active TB (9 cases; 92 per 100,000, 48-177), HIV (31 cases; 0.4%, 0.3-0.5%), syphilis (23 cases; 0.24%, 0.15-036%) and hepatitis C (38 cases; 0.41%, 030-0.57%), and varied widely by nationality. In multivariable analysis, sub-Saharan African nationality was a risk factor for several infections (HIV: OR 51.72, 20.67-129.39; syphilis: OR 424, 1.21-24.82; hepatitis B: OR 437, 2.91-6.41). Hepatitis B (OR 223, 1.05-4.76) and hepatitis C (OR 5.19, 1.70-15.88) were associated with history of blood transfusion. Syphilis (OR 3.27, 1.07-9.95) was associated with history of torture, whereas HIV (OR 1521.54, 342.76-6754.23) and hepatitis B (OR 7.65, 233-25.18) were associated with sexually transmitted infection. Syphilis was associated with HIV (OR 10.27, 130-81.40).
   Conclusions: Testing refugees in an overseas setting through a systematic HA identified patients with a range of infectious diseases. Our results reflect similar patterns found in other programmes and indicate that the yields for infectious diseases vary by region and nationality. This information may help in designing a more targeted approach to testing, which has already started in the UK programme. Further work is needed to refine how best to identify infections in refugees, taking these factors into account.

AB Escherichia coli serotype O157:H7 continues to pose a serious health threat to human beings. Cattle, a major reservoir of the pathogen, harbor E. coli O157:H7 in their gastrointestinal tract and shed variable concentrations of E. coli O157:H7 into the environment. Genetic characterization of cattle-shed E. coli O157 strains is of interest to the livestock industry, food business, and public health community. The present study applied whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) and single nucleotide variant (SNV) calling to characterize 279 cattle-shed E. coli O157:H7 strains isolated from a single feedlot located in southwestern region of the US. More than 4,000 SNVs were identified among the strains and the resultant phylogenomic tree revealed three major groups. Using the Sakai strain genome as reference, more than 2,000 SNVs were annotated and a detailed SNV map generated. Results clearly revealed highly polymorphic loci along the E. coli O157:H7 genome that aligned with the prophage regions and highly variant genes involved in processing bacterial genetic information. The WGS data were further profiled against a comprehensive virulence factor database (VFDB) for virulence gene identification. Among the total 285 virulence genes identified, only 132 were present in all the strains. There were six virulence genes unique to single isolates. Our findings suggested that the genome variations of the E. coli O157:H7 were mainly attributable to dynamics of certain phages, and the bacterial strains have variable virulence gene profiles, even though they came from a single cattle population, which may explain the differences in pathogenicity, host prevalence, and transmissibility by E. coli O157:H7.

AB Background: Many infectious diseases of public health importance display annual seasonal patterns in their incidence. We aimed to systematically document the seasonality of several human infectious disease pathogens in England and Wales, highlighting those organisms that appear weather-sensitive and therefore may be influenced by climate change in the future.
   Methods: Data on infections in England and Wales from 1989 to 2014 were extracted from the Public Health England (PHE) SGSS surveillance database. We conducted a weekly, monthly and quarterly time series analysis of 277 pathogen serotypes. Each organism's time series was forecasted using the TBATS package in R, with seasonality detected using model fit statistics. Meteorological data hosted on the MEDMI Platform were extracted at a monthly resolution for 2001-2011. The organisms were then clustered by K-means into two groups based on cross correlation coefficients with the weather variables.
   Results: Examination of 12.9 million infection episodes found seasonal components in 91/277 (33%) organism serotypes. Salmonella showed seasonal and non-seasonal serotypes. These results were visualised in an online Rshiny application. Seasonal organisms were then clustered into two groups based on their correlations with weather. Group 1 had positive correlations with temperature (max, mean and min), sunshine and vapour pressure and inverse correlations with mean wind speed, relative humidity, ground frost and air frost. Group 2 had the opposite but also slight positive correlations with rainfall (mm, > 1 mm, > 10 mm).
   Conclusions: The detection of seasonality in pathogen time series data and the identification of relevant weather predictors can improve forecasting and public health planning. Big data analytics and online visualisation allow the relationship between pathogen incidence and weather patterns to be clarified.

AB Background: frequent attenders (FAs) use a disproportionately large share of the resources of general practitioners (GPs) working in primary healthcare centres. The aim of this study was to estimate the proportion of FAs among all patients in the primary health care centres of a medium-sized city in Finland, and to examine whether providing GPs with administrative information about their frequent attenders (names and numbers of visits per year) can reduce the number of FAs and the frequency of their visits.
   Methods: Statistic data on all GP visits (n = 1.8 million) to 11 public healthcare centres in one city were collected from the electronic patient records covering the period from 2001 to 2010. A FA-patient was defined as a person who made10 or more visits to GPs during one year. The baseline situation in 2001 was compared with the situation in 2006 after administrative information had been provided three times to all GPs working in the healthcare centres. Poisson's regression analysis was used, and FA numbers and consultation rates in the years 2002-2005 were compared with the year 2006; figures for 2006 were also compared with those for the follow-up period 2007-2010.
   Results: During the years 2001-2006, the proportion of visits of FA-patients fell overall from 9.1 to 8.5%, a decline of 0. 6% (p < 0.0001). This reduction was equivalent to an annual work load of two GPs in the study center. The proportion of visits of FA patients increased again in the follow-up period (2007-2010), when administrative information was no longer provided.
   Conclusion: When GPs are provided with information on the number and names of their FA-patients, the annual rate of FA visits to GPs drops significantly. The method is simple and repeatable. However, without a control group of GPs who have not received such information, it is impossible to assess if the intervention was the only circumstance affecting the reduction in FA consultation rates.

   MORTALITY; ADDRESS; RISK
AB Researchers interested in the effect of health on various life outcomes (such as employment, earnings and life satisfaction) often use self-reported health and disease status as an indicator of true, underlying health status. Self-reports appear to be reasonable measures of overall health. For example, self-assessed overall health has been found to be a reliable predictor of mortality. However, the validity of self-reports is questionable when investigating specific diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. A small and nascent body of research comparing self-reported status on certain diseases with the true status based on clinical diagnoses has found significant gaps. These validation exercises predominantly use data from high-income countries. In this paper, we use survey data from India to compare self-reports of disease prevalence to diagnostic tests conducted on the same individuals. We focus on hypertension and lung disease, two of the primary causes of death in India. We find that self-reported measures substantially understate the true disease burden for both conditions. The attenuation bias from using self-reports is over 80 percent for both diseases, and bigger than estimates from high-income countries. We test and reject the hypothesis that self-reports of the disease status are identical to the true disease status in expectation. We identify characteristics associated with false negative reporting (reporting not having the disease but testing positive for it) for both diseases. The large awareness gap between self-reports and true disease burden indicates multiple deficiencies in India's public health policy. The survey data depicts limited access to medical facilities, high levels of health illiteracy, low rates of health insurance, and other barriers related to poverty and lack of equity in the delivery of health services. These factors prevent timely intervention for managing health and controlling disease, invariably leading to morbidity and often to premature death.

TI iCoverT: A rich data source on the incidence of child maltreatment over
   time in England and Wales
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Child maltreatment is a major public health problem, which is plagued with research challenges. Good epidemiological data can help to establish the nature and scope of past and present child maltreatment, and monitor its progress going forward. However, high quality data sources are currently lacking for England and Wales. We employed systematic methodology to harness pre-existing datasets (including non-digitalised datasets) and develop a rich data source on the incidence of Child maltreatment over Time (iCoverT) in England and Wales. The iCoverT consists of six databases and accompanying data documentation: Child Protection Statistics, Children In Care Statistics, Criminal Statistics, Homicide Index, Mortality Statistics and NSPCC Statistics. Each database is a unique indicator of child maltreatment incidence with 272 data variables in total. The databases span from 1858 to 2016 and therefore extends current data sources by over 80 years. We present a proof-of-principle analysis of a subset of the data to show how time series methods may be used to address key research challenges. This example demonstrates the utility of iCoverT and indicates that it will prove to be a valuable data source for researchers, clinicians and policymakers concerned with child maltreatment. The iCoverT is freely available at the Open Science Framework (osf.io/cf7mv).

AB Background: An inverse relationship exists between physical activity and many non-communicable diseases, such as obesity. Given the daily time spent, a logical domain to reach an adult population for intervention is within and around the workplace. Many government bodies, including the World Health Organization (WHO), include worksite health promotions (WHPs) targeted at increasing physical activity as a public health intervention. The aim of this scoping review was to determine what was measured (outcomes) and how they were measured (evaluation tools) during workplace physical activity interventions in order to identify gaps and implications for policies and practice.
   Methods: A scoping review was executed in April 2017 via PubMed, SPORTDiscus, EBSCOhost and the Cochrane Library. This search included articles published between January 2008 to February 2017 in order to coincide with the WHO's Global Plan of Action on Worker's Health. Extracted information was arranged into data collection grids. Cross-analysis of measured outcomes with their corresponding evaluation tools was completed. A quality assessment based on study design was executed.
   Results: Identification of 732 records was made and ultimately 20 studies and reviews that met criteria were selected. Researchers themed 9 primary measured outcomes. Studies utilized various forms of both objective and subjective evaluation methods. Three primary evaluation methods were categorized: biologic, electronic and declarative tools. The researchers discovered 92 unique tools: 27 objective and 65 subjective, within these parameters.
   Conclusion: Study quality, measurement tools and data collection were heterogeneous making analysis of effect comparisons problematic and unreliable. Much of the published research does not employ robust statistical analysis making effects difficult to ascertain. Considering the variety of both measured outcomes and evaluation tools, only educated inferences can be made as to the effectiveness and efficiency of WHPs. More standardized measurement practices are therefore suggested for assessment efficiency.

AB Objective
   People living with HIV infection (PLWHIV) in Sub-Saharan Africa cope with an increasing workload of care (doctor visits, lab tests, medication management, refills, etc.) in a context of poor health service organization. We aimed to describe the workload of care for PLWHIV in Sub-Saharan Africa and assess to what extent simple adjustments in care organization could reduce this workload of care.
   Methods
   Adult PLWHIV under antiretroviral treatment for at least 1 year were recruited in three centers (two public, one private) in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. Using methods inspired from sociology, we precisely described all health-related activities (HRAs) performed by patients, in 1 month, in terms of time, money and opportunity costs. Then, we assessed the theoretical avoidable workload of care if patients' visits and tests had been grouped on the same days.
   Results
   We enrolled 476 PLWHIV in the study. Patients devoted 6.7 hours (SD = 6.3), on average, in HRAs per month and spent 5% (SD = 11) of their monthly revenue, on average, on health activities. However, we found great inter-patient heterogeneity in the mixture of activities performed (managing medications; dietary recommendations; visits, tests, support groups; administrative tasks; etc.) and their time allocation, temporal dispersion and opportunity costs (personal, familial, social or professional costs). For 22% of patients, grouping activities on the same days could reduce both time and cost requirements by 20%.
   Conclusion
   PLWHIV in Cote d'Ivoire have a heavy workload of care. Grouping visits and tests on the same days may be a simple and feasible way to reduce patients' investment of time and money in their care.

TI Perceptions of Kenyan adults on access to medicines for non-communicable
   diseases: A qualitative study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; AVAILABILITY; CARE
AB In Kenya, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) account for 27% of all deaths. Adult Kenyans have an 18% chance of dying prematurely from cancers, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases or chronic respiratory diseases. A Novartis Access Initiative is making medicines available to treat cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, and breast cancer in 30 countries, including Kenya. Little is known about patients' perceptions of access to medicines for NCDs in Kenya. The study objective was to understand patients' perceptions of access to medicines; as well as barriers and facilitators at the household, community, and healthcare system level. A baseline qualitative study was conducted in eight of 47 counties as part of an evaluation of the Novartis Access Initiative in Kenya. The 84 patients interviewed through a household survey had been diagnosed and treated for an NCD. Although medicines at government facilities were free or cheaper than those sold in private pharmacies, the availability of medicines presented a constant challenge. Patients often resorted to private pharmacies, where NCD medicines cost more than at public facilities. Participants with an NCD took their health seriously and strove to get the medicines, even under difficult circumstances. Buying NCD medicines put a strain on the household budget, especially for the lower-income participants. Some actions to overcome affordability barriers included: borrowing money, selling assets, seeking help from relatives, taking on extra work, buying partial dosages, leaving without the medicines, or resorting to non-medical alternatives. In conclusion, access to NCD medicines is a major challenge for most adults in Kenya. As a result, they engage in complex interactions between public, private facilities and pharmacies to overcome the barriers. The government should ensure well-stocked public sector pharmacies and subsidize prices of medicines for lower-income patients. Integration of industry-led access to medicine programs may help governments to obtain low cost supplies.

ID RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS; NOSOCOMIAL INFECTIONS
AB Background: Mandatory notification of invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections was introduced for laboratories in Germany in 2009. The aims were to support local health authorities (LHAs) in their mandate to prevent and control infections in hospitals and to improve population-based nationwide surveillance of healthcare associated infections. We evaluated the MRSA surveillance system to assess whether its aims were met and to identify areas for improvement.
   Methods: Using the updated guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention we assessed the attributes simplicity, timeliness, data quality, acceptability, and usefulness. In 2016/2017 we interviewed staff in LHAs, state health authorities (SHAs), and laboratories and analyzed surveillance data of cases notified between 2009 and 2016.
   Results: We interviewed 10% of LHAs (n = 38), 63% of SHAs (n = 10), 5 selected laboratories and analyzed information on 27,706 notified MRSA cases. LHAs reported that on receiving notifications from laboratories they contacted hospitals for clinical information, which was time-consuming and complicated as physicians were hard to reach or refused to answer questions, citing doctor-patient confidentiality. LHAs suggested reducing the amount of information collected as some clinical information was unnecessary for implementing control measures. LHAs stated that they received notifications on time, however surveillance data analysis showed some delay. Data completeness exceeded 90% for most variables, however it was only 68% and 80% for dates of disease onset and hospital admission respectively making it impossible to discriminate between hospital and community acquired infections in half of the cases. The surveillance system was well accepted by half of the interviewees. A third however stated that the benefits of the surveillance system were outweighed by the work associated with it. The majority rated the system to be useful for recognizing trends in the MRSA incidence and the ability to check up on infection control measures in hospitals.
   Conclusions: The surveillance system proved to be useful by fulfilling its aims. It was timely, acceptable and provided complete data for most variables. However, the system was complicated; ensuring that only relevant variables are reported could simplify the system without losing any of its usefulness.

ID GENDER-DIFFERENCES; HEALTH-CARE; BURNOUT; SATISFACTION; TRENDS; INCOME;
   RACE
AB Background: Salary is perceived as a key factor affecting job satisfaction, employment, and the retention or migration of physicians within and across countries. This study aimed to describe physicians' salary and workload and to examine the factors determining the salary of physicians in China.
   Methods: We conducted a self-administered, smartphone-based national survey in 136 tertiary hospitals across 31 provinces. A total of 17,615 physicians self-reported their salaries after tax and their characteristics, practice settings, and work efforts in 2015. Then, 2498 of the physicians were followed up for the second-round survey in 2016. Univariate analysis and general estimate equations were applied to evaluate the factors associated with salary.
   Result: In 2015, the average annual salary of the physicians was US$13,764. Physicians in eastern China earned more than those in central (p < 0.001) and western China (p = 0.002) after adjustment for locality expenditure per capita. The salary for men in 2015 was US$14,832, which was more than that for women (US$12,912; p < 0.001). Of the respondents, 76.3% worked more than 40 h per week The physicians dealt with 40 patients per day on average. Consequently, 67.2% physicians spent no more than 10 min with each outpatient. After adjustments for age and management position, salary was associated with years in practice, education background, and specialty, but not with weekly work hours and gender.
   Conclusions: The physicians' salaries were relatively low, and the majority of the respondents worked more than 40 h per week Years in practice, education background, specialty, and region were associated with salary, while weekly work hours and gender were not. To better remunerate Chinese physicians, more resources are demanded, and a workload-based salary scheme should be adopted.

   ANALYSIS; FEMICIDE; FATALITIES; NEWSPAPERS; PORTRAYAL; POLICY; RAPE
AB Background: Violence against women and girls (VAWG) is an important public health issue. Framing studies indicate that how the news media cover public health issues is critical for designing effective health promotion interventions. Notwithstanding this, there is little research particularly in low- and middle-income country context examining how the news media frame VAWG. This paper examines news coverage of VAWG in Ghana, and the implications of this for health promotion.
   Methods: This study used frame analysis as the methodological framework in examining how VAWG in Ghana is represented by the media. Qualitative content analysis approach to frame analysis was performed on 48 news articles which constituted the unit of analysis.
   Results: The findings indicate that media framing of VAWG was episodic in nature as the acts of violence perpetrated against women and girls were presented as individual cases without reference to the wider social contexts within which they occurred. Similarly, victim blaming language was largely used in the news articles. In framing VAWG as an individual incident and women as helpless victims, the media fail to shape society's perception of VAWG as a social and public health issue.
   Conclusions: For the media in Ghana to contribute to the prevention of VAWG, there is the need for news coverage to focus on social construction of the issue, and also raise awareness about support services available to victims.

   SAMPLE
AB Background
   Food insecurity is associated with a wide array of negative health outcomes and higher health care costs but there has been no population-based study of the association of food insecurity and mortality in high-income countries.
   Methods
   We use cross-sectional population surveys linked to encoded health administrative data. The sample is 90,368 adults, living in Ontario and respondents in the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS). The outcome of interest is all-cause mortality at any time after the interview and within four years of the interview. The primary variable of interest is food insecurity status, with individuals classed as "food secure", "marginally food insecure", "moderately food insecure", or "severely food insecure". We use logistic regression models to determine the association of mortality with food insecurity status, adjusting for other social determinants of health.
   Results
   Using a full set of covariates, in comparison to food secure individuals, the odds of death at any point after the interview are 1.28 (CI = 1.08, 1.52) for marginally food insecure individuals, 1.49 (CI = 1.29, 1.73) for moderately food insecure individuals, and 2.60 (CI = 2.17, 3.12) for severely food insecure individuals. When mortality within four years of the interview is considered, the odds are, respectively, 1.19 (CI = 0.95, 1.50), 1.65 (CI = 1.37, 1.98), and 2.31 (CI = 1.81, 2.93).
   Interpretation
   These findings demonstrate that food insecurity is associated with higher mortality rates and these higher rates are especially large for the most severe food insecurity category. Efforts to reduce food insecurity should be incorporated into broader public health initiatives to reduce mortality.

AB Objectives
   Non-communicable diseases, which can refer to chronic diseases that are not caused by infectious agents and can endure for a long time, are currently regarded as a critical public health problem in China. This study aimed to estimate the prevalences of self-reported physician-diagnosed chronic diseases among urban and rural populations aged 15 years and older in Shaanxi Province, China, during 2003-2013 and explore how these changes differ by subpopulation.
   Methods
   Three independent cross-sectional surveys were implemented in 2003, 2008 and 2013 in Shaanxi Province. A multistage stratified cluster random sampling method was used in each wave to collect representative samples. In total, 10,568 residents in 2003, 15,453 in 2008 and 48,808 in 2013 were included in this analysis. Information on self-reported physician-diagnosed chronic diseases was collected using face-to-face interviews in each survey. Multilevel Poisson regression with robust error variance was employed to calculate the adjusted prevalence ratios to estimate the relative change in chronic conditions in 2008 and 2013, compared to that in 2003.
   Results
   In 2013, 23.9%/22.1% of urban/rural residents, respectively, reported having at least one chronic condition, which represents an increase from 17.0%/15.1%, respectively, in 2008 and 12.8%/10.9%, respectively, in 2003. Adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics, the prevalence of chronic diseases was significantly higher in 2013 than that in 2003. Among the chronic diseases studied, the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes has increased dramatically over a decade. The increase in chronic diseases occurred mainly among the middle-aged and elderly.
   Conclusions
   Chronic diseases are highly prevalent and continuously increasing in the adult population in Shaanxi Province from 2003 to 2013. Given its large aging population, China may face a greater chronic disease burden. A national chronic disease surveillance system and screening program should be established to acquire comprehensive information regarding the distribution and trends of chronic diseases.

TI Birth-cohort HCV screening target in Thailand to expand and optimize the
   national HCV screening for public health policy
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID HEPATITIS-C VIRUS; BABY BOOMERS; INFECTION; RECOMMENDATIONS
AB The World Health Organization aims to eliminate HCV infection worldwide by 2030. A targeted HCV screening policy is currently unavailable in Thailand, but a decrease in HCV infection has been observed in the country. However, a previous study showed that there was a higher HCV seroprevalence in adults aged between 30-64 years in the Phetchabun province (15.5%), as compared to the Khon Kaen province (3.6%). It was hypothesized that young adults had a lower rate of HCV seropositivity; this was determined by the age distribution of anti-HCV in Phetchabun and with the identification of high seroprevalence birth cohorts. In order to compare the provincial findings to the national level, anti-HCV birth cohorts were further analyzed in Khon Kaen (averaged-HCV prevalence) as well as the Thai data set that was derived from the previous literature. Thai individuals aged between 18-30 years residing in Phetchabun (n = 1453) were recruited, tested for the presence of anti-HCV antibodies and viral RNA and completed questionnaires that were designed to identify HCV exposure risks. Data was collected and compiled from previously published articles (n = 1667, age 30-64 years). The HCV seropositivity in Phetchabun by age group (18-64, at 5-year intervals) and the birth year were tabulated parallel to the Khon Kaen data set (n = 2233) in conjunction with data from the national survey 2014 (n = 5964) representing the Thai population. Factors such as age, male gender, agricultural work, blood transfusion, intravenous drug use and having a tattoo were associated with anti-HCV positivity in Phetchabun. HCV seroprevalence was less than 4.0% (ranging from 0.0-3.5%) from the age of 18-34 years. A dramatic increase of 15.1% was found in adults aged greater than or equal to 35 years, whereas, the age group in Khon Kaen and the national population with increasing prevalence of HCV were older (>= 40). The HCV seropositivity cohort accumulated for those born between 1951-1982 accounted for 71.4-100.0% of all seropositive individuals. Subsequently, new cases occurred sporadically. This finding provides evidence that there is a disproportionately high HCV seroprevalence among people born before 1983 (or aged >= 35). This cohort should be targeted for priority screening as part of the national HCV screening policy. Incorporating this birth cohort with other risk factors could improve HCV diagnostic rates, resulting in overall improvements in parallel to those given by novel antiviral treatment.

AB Background: HIV remains a significant public health dilemma in West and Central Africa. HIV-related morbidity and mortality are unjustly high, yet little is known about the spectrum of complicating comorbidities in HIV-positive patients who are admitted to hospitals in these regions.
   Methods: This study involved a retrospective chart review to determine the common comorbidities and mortality rate of HIV-infected patients admitted over a six month period to the internal medicine service at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH), a tertiary care center in Ghana. Patients admitted with a known or new HIV diagnosis from January to July 2016 were included. Data were collected regarding the number of new versus known cases admitted, the most common presenting complaints, final admitting diagnoses, and causes of mortality in these patients.
   Results: During the six-month study period, 250 HIV-positive patients were admitted to KATH, and 245 of these individuals had valid survival time recorded. Of these patients, 145/245 (59.2%) were female. Median age of patients included in the study was 42 years old (IQR 35-51). The mortality rate for HIV patients admitted to the hospital was 35. 5% (87 patients). One hundred and forty-five (59.4%) patients had a known history of HIV documented in their patient charts, while the remaining patients were newly diagnosed with HIV during their inpatient stay. Pulmonary tuberculosis predominated among diagnostic findings, with 40.4% of HIV-infected patients diagnosed with the condition while admitted. Patients presenting with neurological symptoms on admission were 2.14 (95% CI: 1.27-3.61) times more likely to die than those without neurological symptoms (p = .004).
   Conclusions: Over 40% of HIV-positive patients admitted to KATH were newly diagnosed with HIV at admission. While pulmonary tuberculosis was the most common co-morbidity, patients presenting with neurological symptoms were at higher risk of death. This study suggests that enhanced outpatient screening is needed for early diagnosis and prompt HAART initiation, as well as increased access to diagnostic modalities and treatment for HIV-positive patients with neurological symptoms.

AB Background: Mental well-being could be promoted and protected by positive psychology (PP) based interventions. Such interventions may be appealing for people at risk of anxiety and depressive disorders, but health-economic evaluations are scarce. The aim was to examine the cost-effectiveness of a PP intervention.
   Methods: Participants with suboptimal levels of mental well-being were randomly assigned to an email guided PPintervention (n = 137) or a wait-list control group (n = 138) with access to usual care (UC). At baseline and 6 months follow-up, data were collected on health care costs. Outcomes of interest were flourishing mental health and treatment response on anxiety and depressive symptoms.
   Results: Bootstrapped mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were (sic)2359 ($2899) for flourishing, (sic)2959 ($3637) for anxiety and (sic)2578 ($3168) for depression, suggesting appreciable health gains for low additional costs. At a willingness to pay ceiling of (sic)10,000 ($12,290) for a treatment response, the probability that the intervention is deemed cost-effective ranged between 90 and 93%.
   Conclusions: The guided PP intervention appears to be a promising strategy as seen from both a public health and a health-economic perspective, especially when there is some willingness to pay. When the PP-intervention is scaled up, then outcome monitoring is recommended to better guarantee the longer term cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

   IDENTITY; SMOKING; MODEL; LIFE
AB Background: Social capital can been described as an individual or a collective attribute, with structural and cognitive components, and a bonding, bridging and linking typology. While extensively studied in the community, studies in occupational settings are sparse by comparison. Furthermore, there is no uniformity in its measurement. This study investigated the construct validity of a Workplace Social Capital questionnaire (WSC), originally developed in the Finnish Public Sector occupational cohort, in a different socio-cultural setting (Cyprus), language (Greek) and occupational group (Registered Nurses). It also explored its criterion concurrent validity according to observed association with self-rated health and psychological distress.
   Methods: Participants were 10% of all registered nurses (N = 362) who responded to the 8-item WSC scale during a nationwide educational programme. A unidimensional model was compared with the postulated two-factor (structural vs cognitive) and three-factor model (bonding, bridging, linking) in Confirmatory Factor Analyses. The association with self-rated health (0-100 Visual Analogue Scale) and mental distress (GHQ-12 = 4) was assessed in linear and logistic regression models.
   Results: A bonding (Cronbach's a = 0.76), bridging (a = 0.78) and linking (a = 0.89) structure explained 77.6% of the variance and was a better fit as indicated by goodness of fit indices. Elevated odds of mental distress and poorer self-rated health were observed among participants with the lowest levels of perceived workplace social capital. In adjusted models, associations appeared stronger with bonding social capital (adjOR of mental distress = 2.71 95% CI = 1.08, 6.79) while those with the highest scores rated their health higher by 8.0 points on average (95% CI = 2.1, 13.8). Low linking social capital was also associated with poorer health but no consistent associations were observed with bridging.
   Conclusion: While associations appeared stronger with bonding and linking, this may reflect a weakness of the measure to fully capture bridging social capital. Even though, this aspect might need strengthening, the WSC showed goodmetric properties in a different setting, language and occupational group. Cross-national and cognitive validation studies are needed.

ID RISK-FACTOR; CONSUMPTION; HEALTH; CONTAMINATION; DRINKING; BURDEN
AB Background: Due to media reports of several deaths, consumption of unrecorded alcohol (i.e., alcohol brewed at home) has emerged as a public health threat in developing countries like Kenya. Empirical data on this issue, however, is scarce. This investigation compared demographic characteristics of Kenyans who drank recorded (regulated) and unrecorded alcohol.
   Methods: We examined all respondents who consumed alcohol in the past month (N = 718) on the 2015 nationally representative Kenya STEPwise survey. Descriptive statistics and bivariate logistic regression examined proportion of respondents consuming unrecorded alcohol, and social demographic factors associated with unrecorded alcohol consumption, respectively.
   Results: The sample was primarily male (86%), married (64%), middle class or higher (64%), with an average age of 37 years. Participants reported an average of 2.5 drinking events and 4.3 binge-drinking occasions per month. Overall, 37% of our sample consumed unrecorded alcohol. Compared to those with incomplete primary education or lower, individuals who completed primary education or above were less likely to report consuming unrecorded alcohol (OR = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.12-0.43). Compared to poorest and poor respondents, those identifying as middle class or above were less likely to consume unrecorded alcohol (OR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.29-.78). Current smokers (OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.34-3.60) and those with higher binge drinking occasions in the past month (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.004-1.07) were significantly more likely to consume unrecorded alcohol.
   Conclusion: Kenyan adults who consume unrecorded alcohol engage in more binge drinking occasions, smoke, and have lower levels of education and socioeconomic status. It is vital that health promotion interventions aimed at reducing unrecorded alcohol consumption be tailored and targeted to individuals with low socio-economic status in Kenya.

AB Background: Rural communities experience unique barriers to food access when compared to urban areas and food security is a public health issue in rural, high poverty communities. A multi-leveled socio-ecological intervention to develop food policy councils (FPCs), and improve food security in rural communities was created. Methods to carry out such an intervention were developed and are described.
   Methods: A longitudinal, matched treatment and comparison study was conducted in 24 rural, high poverty counties in South Dakota, Indiana, Missouri, Michigan, Nebraska and Ohio. Counties were assigned to a treatment (n = 12) or comparison (n = 12) group. Intervention activities focus on three key components that impact food security: 1) community coaching by Extension Educators/field staff, 2) FPC development, and 3) development of a MyChoice food pantry. Community coaching was only provided to intervention counties. Evaluation components focus on three levels of the intervention: 1) Community (FPCs), 2) Food Pantry Organization, and 3) Pantry Client & Families. Participants in this study were community stakeholders, food pantry directors, staff/volunteers and food pantry clients. Pantry food access/availability including pantry food quality and quantity, household food security and pantry client dietary intake are dependent variables.
   Discussion: The results of this study will provide a framework for utilizing a multi-leveled socio-ecological intervention with the purpose of improving food security in rural, high poverty communities. Additionally, the results of this study will yield evidence-based best practices and tools for both FPC development and the transition to a guided-client choice model of distribution in food pantries.

   PROFILE
AB Background: Studies have shown that alcohol intake trajectories differ in their associations with biomarkers of cardiovascular functioning, but it remains unclear if they also differ in their relationship to actual coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence. Using multiple longitudinal cohort studies, we evaluated the association between long-term alcohol consumption trajectories and CHD.
   Methods: Data were drawn from six cohorts (five British and one French). The combined analytic sample comprised 35,132 individuals (62.1% male; individual cohorts ranging from 869 to 14,247 participants) of whom 4.9% experienced an incident (fatal or non-fatal) CHD event. Alcohol intake across three assessment periods of each cohort was used to determine participants' intake trajectories over approximately 10 years. Time to onset for (i) incident CHD and (ii) fatal CHD was established using surveys and linked medical record data. A meta-analysis of individual participant data was employed to estimate the intake trajectories' association with CHD onset, adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics.
   Results: Compared to consistently moderate drinkers (males: 1-168 g ethanol/week; females: 1-112 g ethanol/week), inconsistently moderate drinkers had a significantly greater risk of incident CHD [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-1.37]. An elevated risk of incident CHD was also found for former drinkers (HR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.13-1. 52) and consistent non-drinkers (HR = 1.47, 95% CI = 121-1.78), although, after sex stratification, the latter effect was only evident for females. When examining fatal CHD outcomes alone, only former drinkers had a significantly elevated risk, though hazard ratios for consistent non-drinkers were near identical. No evidence of elevated CHD risk was found for consistently heavy drinkers, and a weak association with fatal CHD for inconsistently heavy drinkers was attenuated following adjustment for confounding factors.
   Conclusions: Using prospectively recorded alcohol data, this study has shown how instability in drinking behaviours over time is associated with risk of CHD. As well as individuals who abstain from drinking (long term or more recently), those who are inconsistently moderate in their alcohol intake have a higher risk of experiencing CHD. This finding suggests that policies and interventions specifically encouraging consistency in adherence to lower-risk drinking guidelines could have public health benefits in reducing the population burden of CHD. The absence of an effect amongst heavy drinkers should be interpreted with caution given the known wider health risks associated with such intake.

AB Background: The UNAIDS 90-90-90 strategy clearly stipulates that 90% of all people on antiretroviral therapy (ART) should have a suppressed viral load. Intensified adherence counselling (IAC) was recently recommended by WHO to improve viral suppression among ART-treated paediatric and adolescent clients with virological failure. This paper describes the implementation and outcomes of IAC in the first year of implementation in a public ART program, to inform strategic interventions to reach the "third 90" among children.
   Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted for all children aged 9 months to 19 years with HIV viral loads (VL) >= 1000 copies/ml at 15 public health facilities from June 2015-December 2016. Data on initial VL test results, IAC sessions, repeat VL test results, and ART regimen switch were abstracted and analysed for completion of IAC and viral suppression after IAC.
   Results: A total of 449 children had a detectable viral load above 1000 copies/ml, after an average of 3.5 years (SD 5.8) years of ART. 192 (43%) were 10-20 years of age, and 320 (71%) were receiving Nevirapine-based ART regimen. Out of 345 (77%) who completed the recommended three IAC sessions, 62 (23%) achieved viral suppression following IAC. The mean time from 1st to 3rd IAC session was 113 (SD 153) days and 172 (50%) of the children had completed the three sessions within 200 days.
   Conclusion: Suppression rates were low among ART-treated children with virological failure that completed the recommended three IAC sessions. As we move towards having 90% of ART-treated children and adolescents achieve and maintain viral suppression, there is need to re-evaluate the implementation of IAC among children and adolescents to consider both psychosocial and biological factors such as resistance testing for those with multiple detectable viral loads.

AB Background
   Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) are a major clinical and public health problem world-wide. The prompt reporting of suspected ADRs to regulatory authorities to activate drug safety surveillance and regulation appears to be the most pragmatic measure for addressing the problem. This paper evaluated a pharmacovigilance (PV) training model that was designed to improve the reporting of ADRs in public health programs treating the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Tuberculosis (TB) and Malaria.
   Methods
   A Structured Pharmacovigilance and Training Initiative (SPHAR-TI) model based on the World Health Organization accredited Structured Operational Research and Training Initiative (SOR-IT) model was designed and implemented over a period of 12 months. A prospective cohort design was deployed to evaluate the outcomes of the model. The primary outcomes were knowledge gained and Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSR) (completed adverse drug reactions monitoring forms) submitted, while the secondary outcomes were facility based Pharmacovigilance Committees activated and health facility healthcare workers trained by the participants.
   Results
   Fifty-five (98%) participants were trained and followed up for 12 months. More than three quarter of the participants have never received training on pharmacovigilance prior to the course. Yet, a significant gain in knowledge was observed after the participants completed a comprehensive training for six days. In only seven months, 3000 ICSRs (with 100% completeness) were submitted, 2,937 facility based healthcare workers trained and 46 Pharmacovigilance Committees activated by the participants. Overall, a 273% increase in ICSRs submission to the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) was observed.
   Conclusion
   Participants gained knowledge, which tended to increase the reporting of ADRs. The SPHAR-TI model could be an option for strengthening the continuous reporting of ADRs in public health programs in resource limited settings.

AB Objective
   To evaluate the potential signaling effect of the Mexican tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) by analyzing the association between awareness of and opinions about its effectiveness with current consumption of taxed SSBs and with a self-reported change in consumption of SSBs since the implementation of the tax. We also examined the association between psychosocial and environmental determinants of SSB consumption with current consumption of taxed SSBs and with a reported change in consumption of SSBs.
   Methods
   Cross-sectional analyses of survey and food-frequency questionnaire data from the Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey 2016. Participants were Mexican adults (20-59 years, N = 6,650). Logistic regression was used to evaluate the probability of a person reporting a decrease in SSB consumption, given their awareness of the tax, opinion about its effectiveness, psychosocial (SSB health-related beliefs, self-efficacy, and liking of SSBs) and environmental (availability of potable water) determinants. Multiple linear regression analysis was utilized to examine the association between the aforementioned factors and current consumption of taxed SSBs.
   Results
   Compared with adults not aware, adults who were aware of the SSB tax were more likely (OR = 1.30) to report a decrease in SSB consumption (p =.012). In urban areas, adults aware of the tax drank a significantly lower amount of taxed SSBs (-15.7%; p =.023) than those not aware. Self-efficacy and liking of SSBs were significantly associated with a reported decrease in consumption and with current consumption (p <.001), while health beliefs and availability of potable water were not significantly associated with either reported change in SSB consumption or current consumption of taxed SSBs.
   Conclusions
   Implementation of an SSB tax accompanied by highly visible campaigns may further influence the impact of taxes on SSBs consumption. Future public health and nutrition education campaigns designed to increase knowledge and enhance motivation should be complemented by programs to assist individuals develop self-efficacy and self-regulation skills.

AB Background
   Schistosomiasis remains one of the most prevalent parasitic infections in the world and has significant economic and public health consequences, particularly in poor communities. Reliable and accurate diagnosis plays a key role in surveillance, prevention and control of schistosomiasis. Currently, the microscopic Kato Katz (KK) stool thick smear technique is the most commonly used method to diagnose Schistosoma mansoni infections in epidemiological surveys. It is well-known that the sensitivity of this parasitological method decreases when infection intensities are moderate to low, however. The urine-based Point-of Care Circulating Cathodic Antigen (POC-CCA) test has been extensively evaluated as a further diagnostic tool. Several studies have shown that the POC-CCA test is more sensitive but less specific than the KK method. However, to clarify the meaning of inconsistent results between KK and POC-CCA tests in clinical routine, this study compares the accuracy of microscopy and POC-CCA versus real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) results of urine and faecal samples from African school children participants.
   Methodology
   This was a school-based cross-sectional study conducted in 2015 among 305 school children aged 7-16 years from two primary schools located in Ilemela and Magu Districts, north-western Tanzania. Single stool and urine samples were collected from each participant and examined for the presence of Schistosoma mansoni eggs, parasite antigen, and parasite DNA using KK thick smears, POC-CCA tests, and real-time PCR, respectively.
   Principal findings
   The prevalence of S. mansoni infection, calculated by KK was 85.2%, by real-time PCR 92.9% and by POC-CCA 94.9%. In comparison to KK, the POC-CCA and real-time PCR tests had sensitivities of 89.7% and 99.5% and specificities of 22.73% and 29.55%, respectively. However, due to the known limitations of the KK assay, we also used latent class analysis (LCA) that included POC-CCA, KK, and schistosome-specific real-time PCR results to determine their sensitivities and specificities. The POC-CCA test had the highest sensitivity (99.5%) and a specificity of 63.4% by LCA and the real-time PCR test had a sensitivity of 98.7% and the highest specificity (81.2%).
   Conclusion
   In moderate and high prevalence areas, the POC-CCA cassette test is more sensitive than the KK method and can be used for screening and geographical mapping of S. mansoni infections. Real-time PCR is highly sensitive and also shows the highest specificity among the 3 investigated diagnostic procedures. It can offer added value in diagnosing schistosomiasis.

AB Climate change is driving emergence and establishment of Ixodes scapularis, the main vector of Lyme disease in Quebec, Canada. As for the black-legged tick, I. scapularis Say, global warming may also favor northward expansion of other species of medically important ticks. The aims of this study were to determine (1) current diversity and abundance of ticks of public health significance other than I. scapularis, (2) sex and age of the human population bitten by these ticks (3), and the seasonal and geographic pattern of their occurrence. From 2007 to 2015, twelve tick species other than I. scapularis were submitted in the Quebec passive tick surveillance program. Of these 9243 ticks, 91.2% were Ixodes cookei, 4.1% were Dermacentor variabilis, 4.0% were Rhipicephalus sanguineus and 0.7% were Amblyomma americanum. The combined annual proportion of submitted I. cookei, D. variabilis, R. sanguineus and A. americanum ticks in passive surveillance rose from 6.1% in 2007 to 16.0% in 2015 and an annual growing trend was observed for each tick species. The number of municipalities where I. cookei ticks were acquired rose from 104 to 197 during the same period. Of the 862 people bitten by these ticks, 43.3% were I. cookei ticks removed from children aged < 10 years. These findings demonstrate the need for surveillance of all the tick species of medical importance in Quebec, particularly because climate may increase their abundance and geographic ranges, increasing the risk to the public of the diseases they transmit.

AB Background: The emergence of fully antimicrobial resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae has led global public health agencies to identify a critical need for next generation anti-gonococcal pharmaceuticals. The development and success of these compounds will rely upon valid pre-clinical models of gonorrhoeae infection. We recently developed and reported the first model of upper genital tract gonococcal infection. During initial characterization, we observed significant reproductive cycle-based variation in infection outcome. When uterine infection occurred in the diestrus phase, there was significantly greater pathology than during estrus phase. The aim of this study was to evaluate transcriptional profiles of infected uterine tissue from mice in either estrus or diestrus phase in order to elucidate possible mechanisms for these differences.
   Results: Genes and biological pathways with phase-independent induction during infection showed a chemokine dominant cytokine response to Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Despite general induction being phase-independent, this common anti-gonococcal response demonstrated greater induction during diestrus phase infection. Greater activity of granulocyte adhesion and diapedesis regulators during diestrus infection, particularly in chemokines and diapedesis regulators, was also shown. In addition to a greater induction of the common anti-gonococcal response, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis identified a diestrus-specific induction of type-1 interferon signaling pathways.
   Conclusions: This transcriptional analysis of murine uterine gonococcal infection during distinct points in the natural reproductive cycle provided evidence for a common anti-gonococcal response characterized by significant induction of granulocyte chemokine expression and high proinflammatory mediators. The basic biology of this host response to N. gonorrhoeae in estrus and diestrus is similar at the pathway level but varies drastically in magnitude. Overlaying this, we observed type-1 interferon induction specifically in diestrus infection where greater pathology is observed. This supports recent work suggesting this pathway has a significant, possibly host-detrimental, function in gonococcal infection. Together these findings lay the groundwork for further examination of the role of interferons in gonococcal infection. Additionally, this work enables the implementation of the diestrus uterine infection model using the newly characterized host response as a marker of pathology and its prevention as a correlate of candidate vaccine efficacy and ability to protect against the devastating consequences of N. gonorrhoeae-associated sequelae.

AB Background: Presence of maternal near-miss conditions in women is strongly associated with the occurrence of adverse perinatal outcomes, but not well-understood in low-income countries. The study aimed to ascertain the effect of maternal near-miss on the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes in Ethiopia.
   Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted in five public hospitals of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Women admitted from May 1, 2015 to April 30, 2016 were recruited for the study. We followed a total of 828 women admitted for delivery or treatment of pregnancy-related complications along with their singleton newborn babies. Maternal near-miss was the primary exposure and was ascertained using the World Health Organization criteria. Women who delivered without complications were taken as the non-exposed groups. The main outcome was adverse perinatal outcomes. Data on maternal near-miss and perinatal outcomes were abstracted from medical records of the participants. Exposed and non-exposed women were interviewed by well-trained data collectors to obtain information about potential confounding factors. Logistic regressions were performed using Stata version 13. 0 to determine the adjusted odds of adverse perinatal outcomes.
   Results: A total of 207 women with maternal near-miss and 621 women with uncomplicated delivery were included in the study. After adjusting for potential confounders, women with maternal near-miss condition had more than five-fold increased odds of adverse perinatal outcomes compared to women who delivered without any complications (AOR = 5.69: 95% CI; 3.69-8.76). Other risk factors that were independently associated with adverse perinatal outcomes include: rural residence, history of prior stillbirth and primary educational level.
   Conclusions: Presence of maternal near-miss in women is an independent risk factor for adverse perinatal outcomes. Hence, interventions rendered at improvement in maternal health of Ethiopia can lead to an improvement in perinatal outcomes.

TI Long term trends and spatial distribution of animal bite injuries and
   deaths due to human rabies infection in Uganda, 2001-2015
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID DOG BITES; EPIDEMIOLOGY; BURDEN; ELIMINATION; DISEASE
AB Background
   In the absence of accurate data on trends and the burden of human rabies infection in developing countries, animal bite injuries provide useful information to bridge that gap. Rabies is one of the most deadly infectious diseases, with a case fatality rate approaching 100%. Despite availability of effective prevention and control strategies, rabies still kills 50,000 to 60,000 people worldwide annually, the majority of whom are in the developing world. We describe trends and geographical distribution of animal bite injuries (a proxy of potential exposure to rabies) and deaths due to suspected human rabies in Uganda from 2001 to 2015.
   Methods
   We used 2001-2015 surveillance data on suspected animal bite injuries, collected from health facilities in Uganda. To describe annual trends, line graphs were used and linear regression tested significance of observed trends at P<0.05. We used maps to describe geographical distribution of animal bites by district.
   Results
   A total of 208,720 cases of animal bite injuries were reported. Of these, 27% were in Central, 22% in Eastern, 27% in Northern and 23% in Western regions. Out of 48,720 animal bites between 2013 and 2015, 59% were suffered by males and 81% were persons aged above 5 years. Between 2001 and 2015, the overall incidence (per 100,000 population) of animal bites was 58 in Uganda, 76 in Northern, 58 in Central, 53 in Western and 50 in Eastern region. From 2001 to 2015, the annual incidence (per 100,000 population) increased from 21 to 47 (P = 0.02) in Central, 27 to 34 (P = 0.04) in Eastern, 23 to 70 (P = 0.01) in Northern and 16 to 46 (P = 0.001) in Western region. A total of 486 suspected human rabies deaths were reported, of which 29% were reported from Eastern, 28% from Central, 27% from Northern and 17% from Western region.
   Conclusion
   Animal bite injuries, a potential exposure to rabies infection, and mortality attributed to rabies infection are public health challenges affecting all regions of Uganda. Eliminating rabies requires strengthening of rabies prevention and control strategies at all levels of the health sector. These strategies should utilize the "One Health" approach with strategic focus on strengthening rabies surveillance, controlling rabies in dogs and ensuring availability of post exposure prophylaxis at lower health facilities.

TI Body mass index in an Australian population with chronic kidney disease
SO BMC NEPHROLOGY

DT Article
DE Associations; Body mass index; Chronic kidney disease; Clinical;
   Demographics
ID OBESITY; RISK; HYPERTENSION; ASSOCIATION; MEN; CKD
AB Background: Obesity emerged as the leading global health concern in 2017. Although higher body mass index (BMI) is a health risk in the general population, its implications for chronic kidney disease (CKD) are not entirely clear. Our aim was to compare BMI in an Australian CKD population with BMI in a sample of the general Australian population, and, in the same group of CKD patients, to describe associations of higher BMI categories with demographic and clinical features.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study of BMI in CKD patients was conducted from three major sites who were enrolled in the CKD.QLD registry between May 2011 and July 2015. BMI was categorized according to the World Health Organisation (VVHO) guidelines. The prevalence of obesity was compared with a sample of the general Australian population from the most recent National Health Survey (NHS). Associations of BMI with demographic and clinical characteristics of the CKD patients were also analysed.
   Results: There were 3382 CKD patients in this study (median age 68, IQR 56-76 years); 50.5% had BMI >= 30, the WHO threshold for obesity, in contrast with 28.4% having BMI >= 30 in the NHS cohort. Higher BMI categories were correlated with age < 70 years, male gender, and lower socioeconomic status. After adjustment for age and gender, characteristics which significantly correlated with higher BMI category included hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, coronary heart disease, other cardiovascular diseases, gout, obstructive sleep apnoea, depression and chronic lung disease.
   Conclusions: Patients with CKD in public renal specialty practices in Queensland have strikingly higher rates of obesity than the general Australian population. Within the CKD population, low socio-economic position strongly predisposes to higher BMI categories. Higher BMI categories also strongly correlated with important co-morbidities that contribute to burden of illness. These data flag major opportunities for primary prevention of CKD and for reductions in morbidity in people who already have CKD, which should be considered in public health policy in relation to obesity.

   SUICIDE; INJURY MORTALITY; PREVENTION; POPULATION
AB Background: Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents worldwide, and is a major driver of health inequity among Indigenous people in high-income countries. However, little is known about the burden of suicide among Indigenous populations in low-and middle-income nations, and no synthesis of the global data is currently available. Our objective was to examine the global incidence of suicide among Indigenous peoples and assess disparities through comparisons with non-Indigenous populations.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review of suicide rates among Indigenous peoples worldwide and assessed disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations. We performed text word and Medical Subject Headings searches in PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), PsycINFO, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), and Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) for observational studies in any language, indexed from database inception until June 1, 2017. Eligible studies examined crude or standardized suicide rates in Indigenous populations at national, regional, or local levels, and examined rate ratios for comparisons to non-Indigenous populations.
   Results: The search identified 13,736 papers and we included 99. Eligible studies examined suicide rates among Indigenous peoples in 30 countries and territories, though the majority focused on populations in high-income nations. Results showed that suicide rates are elevated in many Indigenous populations worldwide, though rate variation is common, and suicide incidence ranges from 0 to 187.5 suicide deaths per 100,000 population. We found evidence of suicide rate parity between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations in some contexts, while elsewhere rates were more than 20 times higher among Indigenous peoples.
   Conclusions: This review showed that suicide rates in Indigenous populations vary globally, and that suicide rate disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations are substantial in some settings but not universal. Including Indigenous identifiers and disaggregating national suicide mortality data by geography and ethnicity will improve the quality and relevance of evidence that informs community, clinical, and public health practice in Indigenous suicide prevention.

AB Background: Consumers most commonly discard unwanted medicines in household rubbish or drains, however, there are global concerns over the extent, environmental impact and health risks. When consumers procure or store medicines for future use, this can impact negatively on quality use of medicines and consumer safety. We sought greater insight into the extent of these practices by exploring the volume and types of medicines in Australian homes, and self-reported practices related to medicine accumulation, use and disposal. This qualitative study formed part of a larger project that included a general population survey on household medicine disposal practices.
   Methods: Semi-structured telephone interviews were undertaken with a subset of respondents (n = 166) from the survey. Participants were eligible if they were experienced medicine users, i.e. used five or more prescribed, over the counter, and/or complementary and alternative medicines. Participants were asked to collect and name all medicines in their household; further detail was obtained about medicines used only when required or no longer used, such as expiry dates and quantity remaining. The quantitative data on the number and type of medicines stored at home were analysed descriptively. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed.
   Results: A total of 2301 medicines were identified as 1424 medicines not in everyday use (unused, unwanted, expired or when required) in 166 households, and 877 regularly used medicines by 119 participants. Medicines were often stored in multiple locations, particularly kitchens. Although accidental ingestion in children and pets and decreased efficacy were recognised health risks, this did not always translate to appropriate storage, usage or disposal practices. Individual risk-benefit assessments were applied to decisions to retain, use or dispose of medicines, including expired medicines.
   Conclusions: Inappropriate medicine storage, use, and/or disposal practices raises public health concerns, particularly as there is a free returned medicines scheme available, and that this particular participant group were considered experienced medicine users. Healthcare professionals must act to address consumer misconceptions around the quality use of medicines, including medicine retention, storage and disposal. Future research is warranted to explore consumer practices in this context and confirm these findings in a younger, or healthier population.

AB Background
   Initiation of breastfeeding within one hour of birth can avert 22% of newborn mortality. Several factors influence breastfeeding practice including mothers' socio-demographic and obstetric characteristics, and factors related to time around child birth. This study explores breastfeeding initiation practices and associated influencing factors for initiating breastfeeding within one hour of birth in public health facilities of Bangladesh.
   Methods
   In this study, normal deliveries were observed in 15 public health facilities from 3 districts in Bangladesh. Study participants were selected by convenient sampling i.e. delivery cases attending health facilities during the study period were selected excluding caesarean section deliveries. Among 249 mothers, time of initiation of breastfeeding was observed and its association was measured with type of health facility, privacy in delivery room, presence of separate staff for newborn, spontaneous breathing, skin-to-skin contact and postnatal contact of mother or newborn with health care providers within one hour after delivery. Data was collected during August-September, 2016. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to measure equality of median duration of breastfeeding initiation time among two or more categories of independent variables. Series of simple logistic regressions were conducted followed by multiple logistic regression to identify the determinants for breastfeeding initiation within one hour.
   Results
   Among 249 mothers observed, 67% initiated breastfeeding within one hour of birth at health facilities and median time to initiate breastfeeding was 38 minutes (Inter-quartile range: 20-56 minutes). After controlling for maternal age as potential confounder, the odds of initiating breastfeeding within one hour of birth was significantly higher if mothers gave birth in district hospitals (AOR 3.5: 95% CI 1.5, 6.4), visual privacy was well-maintained in delivery room (AOR 2.6: 95% CI 1.2, 4.8), newborns cried spontaneously (AOR 4.9: 95% CI 3.4, 17.2), were put to skin-to-skin contact with mothers (AOR 3.4: 95% CI 1.9, 10.4) or were examined by health care providers in the facilities (AOR 2.4: 95% CI 1.3, 12.9).
   Conclusions
   In health facilities, initiation of breastfeeding within one hour is associated with some critical practices and events around the time of birth. With the global push toward facility-based deliveries, it is very important to identify those key factors, within the landscape of maternal and newborn care, which significantly enable health care providers and parents to engage in the evidence-based newborn care activities including early initiation of breastfeeding that will, in turn, reduce global rates of newborn mortality.

AB Emerging evidence indicates that proximity to unconventional oil and gas development (UOGD) is associated with health outcomes. There is intense debate about "How close is too close?" for maintaining public health and safety. The goal of this Delphi study was to elicit expert consensus on appropriate setback distances for UOGD from human activity. Three rounds were used to identify and seek consensus on recommended setback distances. The 18 panelists were health care providers, public health practitioners, environmental advocates, and researchers/scientists. Consensus was defined as agreement of >= 70% of panelists. Content analysis of responses to Round 1 questions revealed four categories: recommend setback distances; do not recommend setback distances; recommend additional setback distances for vulnerable populations; do not recommend additional setback distances for vulnerable populations. In Round 2, panelists indicated their level of agreement with the statements in each category using a five-point Likert scale. Based on emerging consensus, statements within each category were collapsed into seven statements for Round 3: recommend set back distances of <1/4 mile; 1/4-1/2 mile; 1-1 1/4 mile; and >= 2 mile; not feasible to recommend setback distances; recommend additional setbacks for vulnerable groups; not feasible to recommend additional setbacks for vulnerable groups. The panel reached consensus that setbacks of < 1/4 mile should not be recommended and additional setbacks for vulnerable populations should be recommended. The panel did not reach consensus on recommendations for setbacks between 1/4 and 2 miles. The results suggest that if setbacks are used the distances should be greater than 1/4 of a mile from human activity, and that additional setbacks should be used for settings where vulnerable groups are found, including schools, daycare centers, and hospitals. The lack of consensus on setback distances between 1/4 and 2 miles reflects the limited health and exposure studies and need to better define exposures and track health.

AB The human-mediated introduction of marine non-indigenous species is a centuries-if not millennia-old phenomenon, but was only recently acknowledged as a potent driver of change in the sea. We provide a synopsis of key historical milestones for marine bioinvasions, including timelines of (a) discovery and understanding of the invasion process, focusing on transfer mechanisms and outcomes, (b) methodologies used for detection and monitoring, (c) approaches to ecological impacts research, and (d) management and policy responses. Early (until the mid-1900s) marine bioinvasions were given little attention, and in a number of cases actively and routinely facilitated. Beginning in the second half of the 20th century, several conspicuous non-indigenous species outbreaks with strong environmental, economic, and public health impacts raised widespread concerns and initiated shifts in public and scientific perceptions. These high-profile invasions led to policy documents and strategies to reduce the introduction and spread of non-indigenous species, although with significant time lags and limited success and focused on only a subset of transfer mechanisms. Integrated, multi-vector management within an ecosystem-based marine management context is urgently needed to address the complex interactions of natural and human pressures that drive invasions in marine ecosystems.

AB Background: Musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions are common and the biggest global cause of physical disability. The objective of the current study was to estimate the population prevalence of MSK-related pain using a standardized global MSK survey module for the first time.
   Methods: A MSK survey module was constructed by the Global Alliance for Musculoskeletal Health Surveillance Taskforce and the Global Burden of Disease MSK Expert Group. The MSK module was included in the 2015 Solomon Islands Demographic and Health Survey. The sampling design was a two-stage stratified, nationally representative sample of households.
   Results: A total of 9214 participants aged 15-49 years were included in the analysis. The age-standardized four-week prevalence of activity-limiting low back pain, neck pain, and hip and/or knee pain was 16.8, 8.9, and 10.8%, respectively. Prevalence tended to increase with age, and be higher in those with lower levels of education.
   Conclusions: Prevalence of activity-limited pain was high in all measured MSK sites. This indicates an important public health issue for the Solomon Islands that needs to be addressed. Efforts should be underpinned by integration with strategies for other non-communicable diseases, aging, disability, and rehabilitation, and with other sectors such as social services, education, industry, and agriculture. Primary prevention strategies and strategies aimed at self-management are likely to have the greatest and most cost-effective impact.

ID PERIOD
AB Background: Postpartum family planning services is one of the recommended public health intervention aimed at reducing maternal and child morbidity and mortalities. However, there is a paucity studies in rural Tigray region. Therefore, determining the level and associated factors of contraceptive use among postpartum women has the potential to contribute in achieving the Ethiopian Health Sector Transformation Plan and to the Sustainable Development Goals on maternal and infant survival.
   Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was done among 1109 postpartum women from March 29, 2017 to April 29, 2017. Face-to-face interview was used for data collection. The collected data were entered and cleaned using EPI-INFO version 7statistical software and later exported to and analyzed using STATA version 12. Mixed-effects multilevel logistic regression analysis was used to identify the individual and community-level factors associated with contraception adoption. A two side p-value<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
   Results: The level of contraceptive use was 38.3%. Individual-level variables such as women belong to fourth (AOR=1.2; 95% CI: 1.1-3.2) and fifth (AOR = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.3-2.5) wealth quintiles were identified as key predictors of contraception use. In addition, partner secondary (AOR = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.8-3.5) and diploma (AOR = 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-2.6) educational-level and postnatal care (AOR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.9, 4.3) were also significantly affected contraception use. Community-level variables such as high community-level antenatal care services use (AOR = 2.1; 95% CI: 1.9-4.2) and proximity of women to health facility (AOR = 3.0; 95% CI: 2.7-4.6) were also determinants of contraception uptake.
   Conclusions: The status of contraceptive use in rural Tigray region was found to be low. It was found that both individual and community-level variables showed a marked determinant on postpartum contraception use. This study suggested that in order to increase contraceptive use the government should focus on increasing postnatal care, antenatal care services use and reduction of poverty level are important avenues for intervention.

TI Two decades of tobacco use prevention and control policies in Cameroon:
   results from the analysis of non-communicable disease prevention
   policies in Africa
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Health policy analysis; Tobacco control and prevention; Cameroon
ID SMOKING
AB Background: Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in the world today. In 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed efficient and inexpensive "best buy" interventions for prevention of tobacco use including: tax increases, smoke-free indoor workplaces and public places, bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, and health information and warnings. This paper analyzes the extent to which tobacco use prevention policies in Cameroon align with the WHO tobacco "best buy" interventions. It further explores the context, content, formulation and implementation level of these policies.
   Methods: This was a case study combining a structured review of 19 government policy documents related to tobacco use and prevention, in-depth interviews with 38 key stakeholders and field observations. The Walt and Gilson's policy analysis triangle was used to describe and interpret the context, content, processes and actors during the formulation and implementation of tobacco prevention and control policies. Direct observations ascertained the level of implementation of some selected policies.
   Results: Twelve out of 19 policies for tobacco use and prevention address the WHO "best buy" interventions. Cameroon policy formulation was driven locally by the social context of non-communicable diseases, and globally by the adoption of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. These policies incorporated at a certain level all four domains of tobacco use "best buy" interventions. Formulating policy on smoke-free areas was single-sector oriented, while determining tobacco taxes and health warnings was more complex utilizing multisectoral approaches. The main actors involved were ministerial departments of Health, Education, Finances, Communication and Social Affairs. The level of implementation varied widely from one policy to another and from one region to another. Political will, personal motivation and the existence of formal exchange platforms facilitated policy formulation and implementation, while poor resource allocation and lack of synergy constituted barriers.
   Conclusions: Despite actions made by the Government, there is no real political will to control tobacco use in Cameroon. Significant shortcomings still exist in developing and/or implementing comprehensive tobacco use and prevention policies. These findings highlight major gaps as well as opportunities that can be harnessed to improve tobacco control in Cameroon.

AB Background: Tobacco use has serious public health implications for both smokers and non-smokers and significant economic implications on health care spending for governments. Tobacco-related deaths are preventable through well-formulated and implemented tobacco control policies. Using tobacco policy as a case study, we aim to describe the tobacco control policy formulation and implementation and the associated facilitators and barriers in Kenya.
   Method: We used a case-study methodology to integrate two sources of data: a document review of relevant policy documents, published articles and reports between 2004 and 2015 (N = 24 documents) and in-depth interviews (N = 39). Participants were from sectors relevant to tobacco control: research and academia, government, private industry, civil society and non-governmental organizations. Thematic analysis was used to analyze all data.
   Results: Kenya developed a comprehensive tobacco policy in 2007. The main facilitators to the policy formulation and implementation process were (1) political commitment and strong leadership, (2) the presence of a coordination mechanism, (3) stakeholder passion and commitment, (4) resources and (5) constitutional requirement for inclusion of stakeholders. The main barriers to policy formulation and implementation were (1) industry interference, (2) resources, (3) poor enforcement and (4) lack of clear roles.
   Conclusion: Although the process for formulating a tobacco control policy in Kenya was protracted, the current policy aligns well with current global efforts. The implementation is still weak and this can be enhanced by provision of necessary resources and continued engagement of all relevant stakeholders. There is a need for continued engagement with political leadership and continuous international information exchange on how policy-makers can address and counter industry interference in tobacco control efforts.

TI The evolution of non-communicable diseases policies in post-apartheid
   South Africa
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Non-communicable diseases; Multi-sectoral approach; Policy analysis; Key
   informants; South Africa
AB Background: Redressing structural inequality within the South African society in the post-apartheid era became the central focus of the democratic government. Policies on social and economic transformation were guided by the government's blueprint, the Reconstruction and Development Programme. The purpose of this paper is to trace the evolution of non-communicable disease (NCD) policies in South Africa and the extent to which the multi-sectoral approach was utilised, while explicating the underlying rationale for "best buy" interventions adopted to reduce and control NCDs in South Africa. The paper critically engages with the political and ideological factors that influenced design of particular NCD policies.
   Methods: Through a case study design, policies targeting specific NCD risk factors (tobacco smoking, unhealthy diets, harmful use of alcohol and physical inactivity) were assessed. This involved reviewing documents and interviewing 44 key informants (2014-2016) from the health and non-health sectors. Thematic analysis was used to draw out the key themes that emerged from the key informant interviews and the documents reviewed.
   Results: South Africa had comprehensive policies covering all the major NCD risk factors starting from the early 1990's, long before the global drive to tackle NCDs. The plethora of NCD policies is attributable to the political climate in post-apartheid South Africa that set a different trajectory for the state that was mandated to tackle entrenched inequalities. However, there has been an increase in prevalence of NCD risk factors within the general population. About 60% of women and 30% of men are overweight or obese. While a multi-sectoral approach is part of public policy discourse, its application in the implementation of NCD policies and programmes is a challenge.
   Conclusions: NCD prevalence remains high in South Africa. There is need to adopt the multi-sectoral approach in the implementation of NCD policies and programmes.

TI Analysis of tobacco control policies in Nigeria: historical development

SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English

DE Tobacco; Nigeria; Policy; Non-communicable diseases; Multi sectoral
   action; "Best buy" interventions
ID PREVENTION; COUNTRIES
AB Background: Tobacco use is a major risk factor for non-communicable diseases and policy formulation on tobacco is expected to engrain international guidelines. This paper describes the historical development of tobacco control policies in Nigeria, the use of multi-sectoral action in their formulation and extent to which they align with the World Health Organisation "best buy" interventions.
   Methods: We adopted a descriptive case study methodology guided by the Walt and Gilson Policy Analysis Framework. Data collection comprised of document review (N = 18) identified through search of government websites and electronic databases with no date restriction and key informant interviews (N = 44) with stakeholders in public and private sectors. Data was integrated and analyzed using content analysis. Ethical approval was granted by the University of Ibadan and University College Hospital Ethics Review Committee.
   Results: Although the agenda for development of a national tobacco control policy dates back to the 1950s, a comprehensive Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (FCTC) compliant policy was only developed in 2015, 10 years after Nigeria signed the FCTC. Lack of funding and conflict of interest (of protecting citizens from harmful effect of tobacco viz. a viz. the economic gains from the industry) are the major barriers that slowed the policy process. Current tobacco-related policies developed by the Federal Ministry of Health were formulated through strong multi-sectoral engagement and covering all the four WHO "best buy" interventions. Other policies had limited multi-sectoral engagement and "best buy" strategies. The tobacco industry was involved in the development of the Standards for Tobacco Control of 2014 contrary to the long-standing WHO guideline against engagement of the industry in policy formulation.
   Conclusions: Nigeria has a comprehensive national policy for tobacco control which was formulated a decade after ratification of the FCTC due to constraints of funding and conflict of interest. Not all the tobacco control policies in Nigeria engrain the principles of multisectorality and best buy strategies in their formulation. There is an urgent need to address these neglected areas that may hamper tobacco control efforts in Nigeria.

TI Assessment of the multi-sectoral approach to tobacco control policies in
   South Africa and Togo
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Health policy analysis; Tobacco control; Sub-Saharan Africa
AB Background: Tobacco use is the world's leading preventable cause of illness and death and the most important risk factor for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), particularly cardiovascular and chronic respiratory diseases (heart attack, stroke, congestive obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer). Tobacco control is one of the World Health Organization's "best-buys" interventions to prevent NCDs. This study assessed the use of a multi-sectoral approach (MSA) in developing and implementing tobacco control policies in South Africa and Togo.
   Methods: This two-country case study consisted of a document review of tobacco control policies and of key informant interviews (N = 56) about the content, context, stakeholders, and strategies employed throughout policy formulation and implementation in South Africa and Togo. To guide our analysis, we used the Comprehensive Framework for Multi-Sectoral Approach to Health Policy, which is built around four major constructs of context, content, stakeholders and strategies.
   Results: The findings show that the formulation of tobacco control policies in both countries was driven locally by the political, historical, social and economic contexts, and globally by the adoption WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). In both countries, the health department led policy formulation and implementation. The stakeholders involved in South Africa were more diverse, proactive and dynamic than those in Togo, whereas the strategies employed were more straightforward in Togo than in South Africa. The extent of understanding and use of MSA in both countries consisted of an inter-sectoral action for health, whereby the health department strove to collaborate with other sectors within and outside the government. Consequently, information sharing was identified as the main outcome of the interactions between institutions and interest groups within and across three critical sectors of the state, namely the public (government), the private and the civil society.
   Conclusion: Tobacco control policies in South Africa and Togo were formulated and implemented from an inter-sectoral approach perspective, which relied heavily on information transfer between stakeholders and less on collaborative problem-solving approach. Incorporation of multiple stakeholders allowed both countries to formulate policies to meet FCTC goals for tobacco control and NCD reduction.

TI Influence of the WHO framework convention on tobacco control on tobacco
   legislation and policies in sub-Saharan Africa
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Tobacco; WHO; Policy; Sub-Saharan Africa
ID DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; SMOKING PREVALENCE; INDUSTRY
AB Background: The World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, enforced in 2005, was a watershed international treaty that stipulated requirements for signatories to govern the production, sale, distribution, advertisement, and taxation of tobacco to reduce its impact on health. This paper describes the timelines, context, key actors, and strategies in the development and implementation of the treaty and describes how six sub-Saharan countries responded to its call for action on tobacco control.
   Methods: A multi-country policy review using case study design was conducted in Cameroon, Kenya, Nigeria, Malawi, South Africa, and Togo. All documents related to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and individual country implementation of tobacco policies were reviewed, and key informant interviews related to the countries' development and implementation of tobacco policies were conducted.
   Results: Multiple stakeholders, including academics and activists, led a concerted effort for more than 10 years to push the WHO treaty forward despite counter-marketing from the tobacco industry. Once the treaty was enacted, Cameroon, Kenya, Nigeria, Malawi, South Africa, and Togo responded in unique ways to implement tobacco policies, with differences associated with the country's socio-economic context, priorities of country leaders, industry presence, and choice of strategies. All the study countries except Malawi have acceded to and ratified the WHO tobacco treaty and implemented tobacco control policy.
   Conclusions: The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control provided an unprecedented opportunity for global action against the public health effects of tobacco including non-communicable diseases. Reviewing how six sub-Saharan countries responded to the treaty to mobilize resources and implement tobacco control policies has provided insight for how to utilise international regulations and commitments to accelerate policy impact on the prevention of non-communicable diseases.

ID EDUCATION; CAREERS; CHOICES
AB Background: Sierra Leone is pursuing multiple initiatives to establish in-country postgraduate medical education (PGME), as part of national efforts to strengthen the health workforce. This paper explored the career preferences of junior doctors in Sierra Leone; and the potential benefits and challenges with regards to the development of PGME locally.
   Methods: Junior doctors (n = 15) who had graduated from the only medical school in Sierra Leone were purposively sampled based on maximum variation (e.g. men/women, years of graduation). In-depth interviews were conducted in October 2013, and digital diaries and two follow-up interviews were used to explore their evolving career aspirations until November 2016. Additionally, 16 semi-structured interviews with key informants were held to gather perspectives on the development of PGME locally. Results were thematically analysed.
   Results: All junior doctors interviewed intended to pursue PGME with the majority wanting primarily a clinical career. Half were interested in also gaining a public health qualification. Major factors influencing career preferences included: prior exposure, practical (anticipated job content), personal considerations (individual interests), financial provision, and contextual (aspirations to help address certain health needs). Majority of doctors considered West Africa but East and South Africa were also location options for clinical PGME. Several preferred to leave the African continent to pursue PGME. Factors influencing decision-making on location were: financial (scholarships), practical (availability of preferred specialty), reputation (positive and negative), and social (children). Key informants viewed the potential benefits of expanding PGME in Sierra Leone as: cost-effectiveness (compared to overseas specialist training), maintaining service delivery during training years, decreasing loss of doctors (some decide not to return after gaining their specialist degree abroad), and enhancing quality control and academic culture of the local medical school. Major perceived challenges were capacity constraints, especially the dearth of specialists required to achieve training programme accreditation.
   Conclusions: This study has provided an insight into the career preferences of junior doctors in Sierra Leone. It is timely as there is increasing political and professional momentum to expand PGME locally. Findings may guide those involved in this PGME expansion in terms of how possibly to influence junior doctors in their career decision-making.

TI What prevents midwifery quality care in Bangladesh? A focus group

SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH

ID HEALTH SYSTEMS; OF-CARE; COUNTRIES; WORKFORCE; MIDWIVES; WOMENS
AB Background: With professional midwives being introduced in Bangladesh in 2013, the aim of this study was to describe midwifery students perceptions on midwives' realities in Bangladesh, based on their own experiences.
   Method: Data were collected through 14 focus group discussions that included a total of 67 third-year diploma midwifery students at public nursing institutes/colleges in different parts of Bangladesh. Data were analyzed deductively using an analytical framework identifying social, professional and economical barriers to the provision of quality care by midwifery personnel.
   Results: The social barriers preventing midwifery quality care falls outside the parameters of Bangladeshi cultural norms that have been shaped by beliefs associated with religion, society, and gender norms. This puts midwives in a vulnerable position due to cultural prejudice. Professional barriers include heavy workloads with a shortage of staff who were not utilized to their full capacity within the health system. The reason for this was a lack of recognition in the medical hierarchy, leaving midwives with low levels of autonomy. Economical barriers were reflected by lack of supplies and hospital beds, midwives earning only low and/or irregular salaries, a lack of opportunities for recreation, and personal insecurity related to lack of housing and transportation.
   Conclusion: Without adequate support for midwives, to strengthen their self-confidence through education and through continuous professional and economic development, little can be achieved in terms of improving quality care of women during the period around early and late pregnancy including childbirth.The findings can be used for discussions aimed to mobilize a midwifery workforce across the continuum of care to deliver quality reproductive health care services. No matter how much adequate support is provided to midwives, to strengthen their self-confidence through education, continuous professional and economic development, addressing the social barriers is a prerequisite for provision of quality care.

AB Background: Influenza causes an estimated 3000 to 50,000 deaths per year in the United States of America (US). Timely and representative data can help local, state, and national public health officials monitor and respond to outbreaks of seasonal influenza. Data from cloud-based electronic health records (EHR) and crowd-sourced influenza surveillance systems have the potential to provide complementary, near real-time estimates of influenza activity. The objectives of this paper are to compare two novel influenza-tracking systems with three traditional healthcare-based influenza surveillance systems at four spatial resolutions: national, regional, state, and city, and to determine the minimum number of participants in these systems required to produce influenza activity estimates that resemble the historical trends recorded by traditional surveillance systems.
   Methods: We compared influenza activity estimates from five influenza surveillance systems: 1) patient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) from the US Outpatient ILI Surveillance Network (ILINet), 2) virologic data from World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) Laboratories, 3) Emergency Department (ED) syndromic surveillance from Boston, Massachusetts, 4) patient visits for ILI from EHR, and 5) reports of ILI from the crowd-sourced system, Flu Near You (FNY), by calculating correlations between these systems across four influenza seasons, 2012-16, at four different spatial resolutions in the US. For the crowd-sourced system, we also used a bootstrapping statistical approach to estimate the minimum number of reports necessary to produce a meaningful signal at a given spatial resolution.
   Results: In general, as the spatial resolution increased, correlation values between all influenza surveillance systems decreased. Influenza-like Illness rates in geographic areas with more than 250 crowd-sourced participants or with more than 20,000 visit counts for EHR tracked government-lead estimates of influenza activity.
   Conclusions: With a sufficient number of reports, data from novel influenza surveillance systems can complement traditional healthcare-based systems at multiple spatial resolutions.

TI BMScan: using whole genome similarity to rapidly and accurately identify
   bacterial meningitis causing species
SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES

   Reference collection
ID PHYLOGENETIC TREES; NEISSERIA; METAGENOMES; DEFINITION; BIOPYTHON; TOOL
AB Background: Bacterial meningitis is a life-threatening infection that remains a public health concern. Bacterial meningitis is commonly caused by the following species: Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coll. Here, we describe BMScan (Bacterial Meningitis Scan), a whole-genome analysis tool for the species identification of bacterial meningitis-causing and closely-related pathogens, an essential step for case management and disease surveillance. BMScan relies on a reference collection that contains genomes for 17 focal species to scan against to identify a given species. We established this reference collection by supplementing publically available genomes from RefSeq with genomes from the isolate collections of the Centers for Disease Control Bacterial Meningitis Laboratory and the Minnesota Department of Health Public Health Laboratory, and then filtered them down to a representative set of genomes which capture the diversity for each species. Using this reference collection, we evaluated two genomic comparison algorithms, Mash and Average Nucleotide Identity, for their ability to accurately and rapidly identify our focal species.
   Results: We found that the results of Mash were strongly correlated with the results of ANI for species identification, while providing a significant reduction in run-time. This drastic difference in run-time enabled the rapid scanning of large reference genome collections, which, when combined with species-specific threshold values, facilitated the development of BMScan. Using a validation set of 15,503 genomes of our species of interest, BMScan accurately identified 99.97% of the species within 16 min 47 s.
   Conclusions: Identification of the bacterial meningitis pathogenic species is a critical step for case confirmation and further strain characterization. BMScan employs species-specific thresholds for previously-validated, genome-wide similarity statistics compiled from a curated reference genome collection to rapidly and accurately identify the species of uncharacterized bacterial meningitis pathogens and closely related pathogens. BMScan will facilitate the transition in public health laboratories from traditional phenotypic detection methods to whole genome sequencing based methods for species identification.

AB Urinary tract infections (UTIs) associated with Escherichia coli are a growing threat with an increase in the prevalence of multidrug resistant (MDR) strains, particularly beta-lactamase producers, occurring globally. We investigated the presence of carbapenem-resistant uropathogenic E. coli clones in community-acquired UTIs in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) to identify the virulence and resistance structures of the resistant clones and relate the isolates to those circulating globally. A combination of comparative genomics and phenotypic approaches were used to characterize ten MDR-uropathogenic Escherichia coli isolates recovered from UTI patients in Riyadh between November 2014 and January 2015. We report the presence of NDM-1 and 5, and OXA-181 in carbapenem-resistant UPEC strains from Riyadh, KSA. Single nucleotide polymorphism analyses demonstrated that these ten isolates fell into four phylogenetically distinct clades within the UPEC phylogeny. Comparative genomic analyses indicate that these diverse clones could be distinguished according to their multilocus sequencing type (MLST), serology, and virulence and antimicrobial gene architectures. These clones include the b/aNDm-i carrying isolates of the globally predominant MDR ST131 and ST69 types, previously identified as one of the most common UPEC strains in KSA. This is in addition to clones of ST23Cplx (ST410) and ST448Cplx (ST448) that have likely evolved from common intestinal strains, carrying copies of beta-lactamase genes including bla(NDM-5), bla(CTX-m-15), bla(TEM-1), bla(CMY-42), bla(OXA-1) and bla(OXA-181). These data have identified an emerging public health concern and highlight the need to use comprehensive approaches to detect the structure of MDR E. coli populations associated with community-acquired UTIs in KSA.

AB Animal use in biomedical research is generally justified by its potential benefits to the health of humans, or other animals, or the environment. However, ethical acceptability also requires scientists to limit harm to animals in their research. Training in laboratory animal science (LAS) helps scientists to do this by promoting best practice and the 3Rs. This study evaluated scientists' awareness and application of the 3Rs, and their approach to other ethical issues in animal research. It was based on an online survey of participants in LAS courses held in eight venues in four European countries: Portugal (Porto, Braga), Germany (Munich, Heidelberg), Switzerland (Basel, Lausanne, Zurich), and Denmark (Copenhagen). The survey questions were designed to assess general attitudes to animal use in biomedical research, Replacement alternatives, Reduction and Refinement conflicts, and harm-benefit analysis. The survey was conducted twice: immediately before the course ('BC', N = 310) and as a follow-up six months after the course ('AC', N = 127). While courses do appear to raise awareness of the 3Rs, they had no measurable effect on the existing low level of belief that animal experimentation can be fully replaced by non-animal methods. Most researchers acknowledged ethical issues with their work and reported that they discussed these with their peers. The level of an animal's welfare, and especially the prevention of pain, was regarded as the most pressing ethical issue, and as more important than the number of animals used or the use of animals as such. Refinement was considered more feasible than Replacement, as well as more urgent, and was also favoured over Reduction. Respondents in the survey reversed the 'hierarchy' of the 3Rs proposed by their architects, Russell and Burch, prioritizing Refinement over Reduction, and Reduction over Replacement. This ordering may conflict with the expectations of the public and regulators.

AB The high global prevalence of school violence underlines the need for prevention. However, there are few scientifically evaluated intervention approaches that aim at preventing violence by teachers. We evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of the preventative intervention Interaction Competencies with Children for Teachers (ICC-T). In a cluster randomized controlled trial we assessed attitudes towards and use of violence by teachers (self-reported and reported by students) at eight schools in four regions in Tanzania. Two regions were randomly assigned as intervention regions. Data were assessed in the months before and three months after intervention. In total, 158 teachers (58% females; age: 32.08 years, SD = 5.65) and 486 students (54% females; age: 15.61 years, SD = 0.89) participated in this study. The feasibility was very good: Participants' acceptance was high and they reported a good integration of the core elements in their working routine. The significantly stronger decrease in the use of emotional and physical violence reported both by teachers and students as well as the stronger decrease in positive attitudes of teachers towards physical and emotional violence in the intervention schools at follow-up provide initial evidence of the efficacy. However, further evidence for the sustainability of its effect is needed.

AB Lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, and/or queer (LGBTQ) people face barriers to accessing mental health care; however, we know little about service experiences of low income LGBTQ people. In this qualitatively-driven mixed methods study, over 700 women and/or trans people completed an internet survey, of whom 12 LGBTQ individuals living in poverty participated in interviews. Low income LGBTQ respondents saw more mental health professionals and had more unmet need for care than all other LGBTQ/income groups. Narrative analysis illustrated the work required to take care of oneself in the context of extreme financial constraints. These findings highlight the mechanisms through which inadequate public sector mental health services can serve to reproduce and sustain both poverty and health inequities.

TI Anticoagulation Knowledge Tool (AKT): Further evidence of validity in

AB Introduction
   Oral Anticoagulation therapy (OAC) is highly effective in the management of thromboembolic disorders. An adequate level of knowledge is important for self-management and optimizing clinical outcomes. The Anticoagulation Knowledge Tool (AKT) was developed to assess OAC knowledge and caters for both patients prescribed direct oral anticoagulants or vitamin K antagonist (VKA). However, evidence regarding its psychometric proprieties, validity and reliability are unavailable in non-English speaking settings. For this reason, the aim of this study is to provide further evidence of validity for AKT and also developing an Italian AKT version (I-AKT) supported by evidence of validity and reliability.
   Methods
   A multiphase study was conducted which included the following: cultural and linguistic validity; i.e. content validity; construct validity; reliability assessment. The Construct validity was performed using the contrasted group approach using three groups comprised of health care providers, patients and the general public. Furthermore, Exploratory Structural Equation Modelling (ESEM) was performed to confirm the mono-dimensional structure of the items in the AKT.
   Results
   In construct validity phase 334 participants were enrolled. One-way ANOVA and post hoc analysis test demonstrated significant differences between the means knowledge scores of the three groups: 30.42 +/- 3.04 vs 23.45 +/- 4.57 vs14.32 +/- 6.07 (Statistic F = 266.83; p <.001).ESEM analysis demonstrates the I-AKT mono-dimensionally structure with an explained variance of 56.42%. The scale also showed both good internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.896) and test-retest reliability (r = 0.855).
   Conclusion
   This study developed and validated I-AKT with supporting evidence for validity and reliability. The study also confirms the mono-dimensional of the items in the AKT. This suggest that the instrument can be useful in non-English setting for knowledge assessment and in potentially developing patient education materials.

TI Sero-prevalence of yellow fever and related Flavi viruses in Ethiopia: a
   public health perspective
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Yellow fever; Flaviviruses; Risk assessment; Ethiopia
ID RISK-ASSESSMENT; EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Background: Yellow fever (YF) is a viral hemorrhagic fever, endemic in the tropical forests of Africa and Central and South America. The disease is transmitted by mosquitoes infected with the yellow fever virus (YFV). Ethiopia was affected by the largest YF outbreak since the vaccination era during 1960-1962. The recent YF outbreak occurred in 2013 in Southern part of the country. The current survey of was carried out to determine the YF seroprevalence so as to make recommendations from YF prevention and control in Ethiopia.
   Methodology: A multistage cluster design was utilized. Consequently, the country was divided into 5 ecological zones and two sampling towns were picked per zone randomly. A total of 1643 serum samples were collected from human participants. The serum samples were tested for IgG antibody against YFV using ELISA. Any serum sample testing positive by ELISA was confirmed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). In addition, differential testing was performed for other flaviviruses, namely dengue, Zika and West Nile viruses.
   Result: Of the total samples tested, 10 (0.61%) were confirmed to be IgG positive against YFV and confirmed with PRNT. Nine (0.5%) samples were antibody positive for dengue virus, 15(0.9%) forWest Nile virus and 7 (0.4%) for Zika virus by PRNT. Three out of the five ecological zones namely zones 1, 3 and 5 showed low levels (< 2%) of IgG positivity against YFV. A total of 41(2.5%) cases were confirmed to be positive for one of flaviviruses tested.
   Conclusion: Based on the seroprevalence data, the level of YFV activity and the risk of a YF epidemic in Ethiopia are low. However additional factors that could impact the likelihood of such an epidemic occurring should be considered before making final recommendations for YF prevention and control in Ethiopia. Based on the results of the serosurvey and other YF epidemic risk factors considered, a preventive mass vaccination campaign is not recommended, however the introduction of YF vaccine in routine EPI is proposed nationwide, along with strong laboratory based YF surveillance.

AB Background: Domestic violence during pregnancy with its many negative fetal and maternal outcomes is a common public health problem all over the world. Nonetheless, the problem is not well investigated and understood in Ethiopia. Hence, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of domestic violence and associated factors among pregnant women attending the University of Gondar Referral Hospital antenatal care (ANC) services.
   Methods: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March May 2016. A total of 450 pregnant women who visited the clinic were included in the study. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select study participants, and a pretested structured questionnaire was employed to collect data. The WHO multicountry study on women's health and domestic violence against women was used to assess the violence against pregnant women. Descriptive statistics such as means, frequencies and percentages were computed. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was carried out to identify factors associated with domestic violence, and variables with p-values < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.
   Results: Of the total pregnant women surveyed, 58.7% were victims of at least one form of domestic violence during pregnancy, emotional violence being the most common (57.8%). The multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that house wives (adjusted odd ratio (AOR) = 3.43, 95% CI: 1.63, 7.21), women with no salary of their own (AOR = 3.37, 95% CI: 2.14, 7.95), partners' daily use of alcohol (AOR = 4.59, 95% CI: 1.82, 11.56), women who believed in women's rights to decide to be pregnant (AOR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.18, 2.89), and women who disobeyed their partner (AOR = 2.36, 95% CI: 1.37, 4.07) were found to be positively and significantly associated with domestic violence during pregnancy.
   Conclusion: A high proportion of pregnant women experienced domestic violence during their pregnancy. Being a housewife, poor income status, partners' use of alcohol, unwanted pregnancy, and disobeying of the women to their partner were factors associated with domestic violence during pregnancy. Evidence based female empowerment, especially the empowerment of women without income of their own, partner education and positive relations between partners are very important to minimize the problem.

AB Background: Whilst observational studies establish that lower plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels are associated with higher risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), establishing causality has proven challenging. Since vitamin D is modifiable, these observations have substantial clinical and public health implications. Indeed, many health agencies already recommend supplemental vitamin D. Here, we explore causality in a large Mendelian randomisation (MR) study using an improved genetic instrument for circulating 25-OHD.
   Methods: We developed a weighted genetic score for circulating 25-OHD using six genetic variants that we recently reported to be associated with circulating 25-OHD in a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis. Using this score as instrumental variable in MR analyses, we sought to determine whether circulating 25-OHD is causally linked with CRC risk We conducted MR analysis using individual-level data from 10,725 CRC cases and 30,794 controls (Scotland, UK Biobank and Croatia). We then applied estimates from meta-analysis of 11 GWAS of CRC risk (18,967 cases; 48,168 controls) in a summary statistics MR approach.
   Results: The new genetic score for 25-OHD was strongly associated with measured plasma 25-OHD levels in 2821 healthy Scottish controls (P = 1.47 x 10(-11)), improving upon previous genetic instruments (F-statistic 46.0 vs. 13.0). However, individual-level MR revealed no association between 25-OHD score and CRC risk (OR 1.03/unit log-transformed circulating 25-OHD, 95% CI 0.51-2.07, P= 0.93). Similarly, we found no evidence for a causal relationship between 25-OHD and CRC risk using summary statistics MR analysis (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.69-1.19, P= 0.48).
   Conclusions: Despite the scale of this study and employing an improved score capturing more of the genetic contribution to circulating 25-OHD, we found no evidence for a causal relationship between circulating 25-OHD and CRC risk Although the magnitude of effect for vitamin D suggested by observational studies can confidently be excluded, smaller effects sizes and non-linear relationships remain plausible. Circulating vitamin D may be a CRC biomarker, but a causal effect on CRC risk remains unproven.

AB Background: Clinical Pharmacy Services (CPS) are a reality in many health systems around the world. However, there are few studies that discuss the facilitators and the strategies to implement CPS in healthcare systems. In this way, the objective of this study was to identify the facilitators and strategies involved in the CPS implementation process in some public health units in a metropolis in the Northeast Brazil.
   Methods: A qualitative study was carried out with health-system pharmacists and managers who experienced the implementation of CPS. Therefore, focus groups were conducted with pharmacists, and the interviews with the managers. The discussions were carried out through semi-structured scripts and were recorded in audio and videos, after the signature of the consent form. The recordings were transcribed and analyzed independently through content analysis, followed by consensus meetings between researchers.
   Results: Two focus groups were conducted, with an average of seven pharmacists per group, and five interviews with local health managers. Participants reported 39 facilitators who were related to the categories: local healthcare network, healthcare team, pharmacists and implementation process of the CPS. And 21 strategies attributed to the following categories: local healthcare network, pharmacists and implementation process of the CPS.
   Conclusions: This study identified facilitators and strategies of the implementation of CPS. Most of the positive experiences were related to the clinical skills and proactive attitudes of pharmacists. These findings may support pharmacists and health managers to implement CPS in health systems.

   This study enrolled 600 participants from 60 Lower Basic Schools in West Coast Region of the country. Stool samples collected from the participants were presumptively screened for the ESBLs producing Enterobacteriaceae, using Drigalski agar, supplemented with 2mg/L cefotaxime. The bacterial colonies that grew on each Drigalski agar were tested for ESBL production by the double disk synergy test as recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI-2015). The confirmatory analysis for ESBL was determined as the zone of inhibition of cefotaxime and/or ceftazidime to >= 5mm from that of cefotaxime /clavulanicacid and/or ceftazidime/clavulanic acid. The presumptive screening of isolates for AmpC phenotypes was done by testing the organism against cefoxitin. The prevalence of the ESBL carriage was presented in percentages. The association of risk factors to the faecal carriage of ESBLs producing Enterobacteriaceae was performed by Pearson Chisquared and Fishers Exact at (p <= 0.05).
   Result
   The prevalence of faecal carriage ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae among food handlers was 5.0% (28/565). We found 50% (14/28) and 3.57% (1/28) ESBL producing bacteria were presumptive AmpC and carbapenemase resistance phenotype. The most abundant ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae were Klebsiella spp 32.1% (9/28) and Escherichia spp 28.6% (8/28). The use of antibiotics in the last 3 months was found to be significantly associated (P = 0.012) with the faecal carriage of ESBLs producing Enterobacteriaceae.
   Conclusion
   The prevalence of faecal carriage of ESBLs producing Enterobacteriaceae among food handlers in the Gambia is low. The history to use of the antibiotics in the last three months was found to be significantly associated with this prevalence. Therefore, the institution of a robust antimicrobial surveillance and treatment of patients with such infections are necessary to curb the spread of these multidrug resistant bacteria in the country. Rational prescription and usage of the antibiotics especially cephalosporin should be advocated both in public and private health facilities.

AB Background: Monitoring of undernutrition and parasitic infection are essential to design appropriate intervention strategies. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of undernutrition, intestinal parasitic infection and their associated risk factors among school children in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia.
   Methods: A school-based cross-sectional survey was conducted from February to June 2014 among 382 students selected from primary schools in Bahir Dar. The study subjects were selected by a systematic random sampling method. Sociodemographic data from students and their family/guardians were obtained using structured questionnaire. Height and weight of the students were measured using a standard calibrated balance. Fresh fecal samples were collected and processed using formalin-ether concentration technique. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 20.0 statistical software.
   Results: The overall prevalence of undernutrition was 41.6% (18.3% stunted, 26.7% thinness and 25.9% underweight). Meal frequency <= 3 times a day (AOR=4.11; 95% CI: 2.23-7.59) and family monthly income <500 birr (AOR=5.87; 95% CI: 2.61-13.23) were important predictors of undernutrition. The risk of stunting was increased among students with meal frequency <= 3 times a day (AOR=5.56; 95% CI: 2.97-10.41) and age ranges from 9-10 years (AOR=3.02; 95% CI: 1.41-6.47). The odds of thinness was significantly increased among students with parasitic infection (AOR=1.92; 95% CI: 1.15-3.19) and family monthly income <1500 birr (AOR=2.69; 95% CI: 1.16-6.26). The likelihood of being underweight was increased among students infected with intestinal parasites (AOR=2.43; 95% CI: 1.40-4.22). The overall prevalence of intestinal parasitosis was 52.4%. The risk of parasitic infection was significantly increased among students with unclean fingernails (AOR=4.96; 95% CI: 2.79-8.82) and irregular hand washing habit (AOR=8.05; 95% CI: 4.66-13.89).
   Conclusions: This study revealed that undernutrition and intestinal parasitic infection were public health problems among school children in the study areas. These results highlight the importance for integrated efforts to address undernutrition and parasitic infection.

TI Epidemiology of birth defects based on surveillance data from 2011-2015
   in Guangxi, China: comparison across five major ethnic groups
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID PUBLIC-HEALTH; MALFORMATIONS; PREVALENCE
AB Background: The causes of birth defects (BDs) are complex and include genetic and environmental factors and/or their interactions. More research is needed to describe the epidemiology of BDs within specific regions of China. This study focused on differences in the prevalence of BDs based on ethnicity in a large city in Guangxi Province, China.
   Methods: Surveillance data of infants born in 114 registered hospitals in Liuzhou between 2011 and 2015 were analyzed to determine the epidemiology of BDs across five major ethnic groups. We calculated the prevalence of BDs and relative risk of BDs by ethnicity.
   Results: There were 260,722 perinatal infants of which 6581 had BDs, with the average prevalence of 25.24 per 1000 perinatal infants (PIs). Prevalence data showed an obvious uptrend over the past 5 years. Han had the highest prevalence of total BDs (28.98 parts per thousand), followed by Zhuang (25.19 parts per thousand), Yao (18.50 parts per thousand), Miao (15.78 parts per thousand) and Dong (14.24 parts per thousand). Relative to the Han; Zhuang, Miao, Yao, and Dong had a lower risk of musculoskeletal and urogenital malformations; Miao and Yao had a lower risk of cardiovascular malformation; and Dong had a lower risk of cardiovascular and craniofacial malformation. Several maternal risk factors were found to be associated with BDs (e.g., maternal and gestational age, number of antenatal care visits).
   Conclusion: This study provided a comprehensive description of ethnic differences in the risk of BDs in Liuzhou City, China. Observed ethnic differences in the risk of BDs may be related to genetic susceptibilities, environment, cultural customs, or to potential combinations of these factors.

AB Background: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been shown to be linked to health risk behaviours (HRBs). This study aims to identify risk factors for ACEs and to examine the associations between ACEs and single and multiple HRBs in a sample of university students in Germany.
   Methods: An online-based cross-sectional study was conducted among public university students (N = 1466). The widely applied ACE questionnaire was used and extended to operationalise 13 categories of childhood adversity. First, variables for each type of ACE and HRB were dichotomised (single ACEs and single HRBs), and then used for cumulative scores (multiple ACEs and multiple HRBs). Frequencies were assessed, and (multinomial) logistic regression analyses were performed.
   Results: Prevalence rates of ACEs ranged from 3.9 to 34.0%, depending on the type of childhood adversity. Sociodemographic risk and protective factors for single/multiple ACEs varied strongly depending on the outcome. In particular, a high family socioeconomic status seemed to be a consistent protective factor for most ACEs. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, both single and multiple HRBs were associated with single events of ACEs. Moreover, dose-response relationships between multiple ACEs and various single and multiple HRBs were found.
   Conclusions: The study provides strong evidence that ACEs are associated with HRBs. The number of ACEs may play a role in single or multiple HRBs. Reducing the number of ACEs could thus decrease HRBs, which account for many of the leading causes of morbidity and death. The findings highlight the importance of trauma-informed health interventions designed to prevent the occurrence of ACEs, and build capacity among children and adults.

TI The implementation of Xpert MTB/RIF assay for diagnosis of tuberculosis
   in Nepal: A mixed-methods analysis
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CHALLENGES; PROGRAMS; IMPACT
AB Background
   Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem in low and middle-income countries. Early detection and enrolment of TB cases is a challenge for National TB Programs.
   Objective
   To understand the performance and feasibility for scale-up of Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the TB diagnosis in Nepal.
   Design
   Implementation research employed mixed-method sequential explanatory design. The results of Xpert MTB/RIF assay were analysed in 26 TB diagnostic centres where Xpert machines had been installed before 2015. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with stakeholders, purposively selected to represent experiences in centres that were functioning well, poorly or not functioning.
   Results
   During a one-year period in 2015/16, 23,075 Xpert MTB/RIF assays were performed in 21 diagnostic centres with 22,288 people also tested by sputum microscopy. Among these, 77% had concordant (positive or negative) results, demonstrating fair agreement (Kappa score, 0.3) between test results. Test failure and positivity rates in diagnostic centres ranged from 2.6% to 13.4% and 6.5% to 49%, respectively. The number of cartridges per positive result varied from 2.3 to 10.2. Xpert assay was positive in 3314 (15% of all cases) sputum smear microscopy negative cases. Of 4280 bacteriologicaliy confirmed cases by Xpert assay, 355 (8%) were rifampicin resistant. Xpert machines were no longer functioning regularly throughout the year in 5 diagnostic centres. The main barriers for effective implementation of Xpert in Nepal were the lack of: timely supply of cartridges; replacement of damaged modules; maintenance of Xpert machines; and stock verification for timely procurement of cartridges. Inadequate laboratory infrastructure for maintaining functional Xpert equipment further challenges implementation and scale-up.
   Conclusion
   The implementation of Xpert MTB/RIF assay has increased case-finding of TB and MDR-TB in Nepal. However, there is a need to improve laboratory performance and strengthen laboratory infrastructure for optimal utilisation and scale-up of Xpert.

AB Aim
   The aim was to explore contraceptive uptake, associated factors and satisfaction among post abortion-care (PAC) seeking women in Kenya. Due to unsafe abortions, almost 120 000 Kenyan women received PAC in 2012, and of these women, 70% did not use contraception before pregnancy.
   Methods
   This study was nested in a larger randomised controlled trial, where 859 women sought PAC at two public hospitals in Kisumu, in June 2013-May 2016. The women were randomly assigned to a midwife or a physician for PAC, including contraceptive counselling, and followed up at 7-10 days and three months. Associated factors for contraceptive uptake were analysed with binary logistic regression, and contraceptive method choice, adherence and satisfaction level were examined by descriptive statistics, using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22.0.
   Results
   Out of the 810 PAC-seeking women, 76% (n = 609) accepted the use of contraception. Age groups of 21-25 (OR: 2.35; p < 0.029) and 26-30 (OR: 2.22; p < 0.038), and previous experience of 1-2 gravidities (OR 1.939; p = 0.018) were independent factors associated with the up-take. Methods used: injections 39% (n = 236); pills 27% (n = 166); condoms 25% (n = 151); implant 7% (n =45) and intrauterine device (IUD) 1% (n = 8). At 3-month follow-up of the women (470/609; 77%), 354 (75%) women still used contraception, and most (n = 332; 94%) were satisfied with the method. Reasons for discontinuation were side-effects (n = 44; 39%), partner refusal (n = 27; 24%), planned pregnancy (n = 27; 24%) and lack of resupplies (n = 15; 13%).
   Conclusions
   PAC-seeking women seem highly motivated to use contraceptives, yet a quarter decline the use, and at 3-month follow-up a further quarter among the users had discontinued. Implant, IUD and permanent method are rarely used. Strategies to improve contraceptive counselling, particularly to adolescent girls, and to increase access to a wide range of methods, as well as provider training and supervision may help to improve contraceptive acceptance and compliance among PAC-seeking women in Kisumu, Kenya.

   In October 2017, healthcare workers were offered voluntary testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), hepatitis B core antibody (antiHBc), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and hepatitis B e antibody (anti-HBe) using rapid lateral flow assay for all samples, followed by Enzyme Immunosorbent Assay to confirm positive results. Participants completed a questionnaire about knowledge, attitudes and practices concerning hepatitis B. HBsAg positive participants were invited to a clinic for further assessment.
   Results
   Overall, 447 participants were tested for hepatitis B. Most (90.6%, 405/447) participants were nurses, 72.3% (323/447) were female and 71.6% (320/447) were 30 years or older. The prevalence of chronic hepatitis B (HBsAg positivity) was 8.7% (39/447, 95% CI 6.311.7%). There was no significant difference in prevalence by sex, age group, site of work or type of job. None of the 66.7% (26/39) of participants with chronic hepatitis B who attended the clinic met the 2015 WHO criteria to start treatment for hepatitis B on the basis of cirrhosis. Most participants (96.9% 432 / 446) stated that they were worried about their risk of hepatitis B at work.
   Conclusions
   Hepatitis B is highly prevalent among healthcare workers in Sierra Leone. It is unclear whether this reflects high community prevalence or is due to occupational risk. No participants with chronic hepatitis B needed to start treatment. In order to achieve the WHO target of elimination of viral hepatitis by 2030, introduction of birth dose vaccine for infants and catch-up vaccines for healthcare workers and healthcare students, together with a national hepatitis B screen and treat programme is advisable for Sierra Leone.

TI Amino-acid-enriched cereals ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTF) are as
   effective as milk-based RUTF in recovering essential amino acid during
   the treatment of severe acute malnutrition in children: An individually
   randomized control trial in Malawi
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID SKELETAL-MUSCLE; MALNOURISHED CHILDREN; PROTEIN-SYNTHESIS; MANAGEMENT;
   GLUTATHIONE; METABOLISM; INGESTION
AB Background
   Ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) is used to treat children suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM). Standard RUTF uses milk as the primary protein source, which makes the product expensive, and given the high worldwide SAM burden, having a less expensive effective alternative is a public health priority.
   Objective
   The objective of this study was to evaluate whether newly developed amino acid-enriched milk-free RUTF (FSMS-RUTF) or amino acid-enriched low-milk RUTF (MSMS-RUTF) treatment could replenish plasma amino acids to levels comparable to those following standard peanut-milk RUTF (PM-RUTF) treatment and to improve understanding of the effects of treatment on anthropometric measurements. A secondary analysis was performed to test the noninferiority hypothesis of plasma essential amino acid (EAA) levels.
   Methods
   Plasma EAA levels were measured in a nonblinded, 3-arm, parallel-group simple randomized controlled trial conducted in Malawi to examine the efficacy of FSMS-RUTF, MSMS-RUTF and PM-RUTF in the treatment of SAM in 2 groups of children aged 6-23 and 24-59 months (mo). Sample size calculations were performed based on the previous our study. A noninferiority margin was set at -25% of the PM-RUTF arm at discharge.
   Results
   The relative values of the differences (95% Cl) in plasma EAA levels between PM-RUTF treatment and FSMS-RUTF and MSMS-RUTF treatments at discharge were -7.9% (-18.6, 2.8) and 9.8% (0.2,19.5), respectively, in children aged 6-23 mo, while in those aged 24-59 mo, the difference values were 17.8% (1.6,34.1) and 13.6% (-2.8, 29.9), respectively.
   Conclusion
   At discharge, the plasma EAA concentrations in 6-59-mo-old SAM children treated with FSMS-RUTF and MSMS-RUTF were not less than those of children treated with PM-RUTF. These findings indicate that treatment with either of the 3 RUTFs was associated with adequate protein synthesis and that all the formulations provided sufficient functional metabolites of plasma amino acids to support nutritional recovery from SAM.

AB Background: Measuring the quality of life (QoL) of women with breast cancer is an important aspect of measuring treatment success. In Croatia, no QoL studies have been carried out with a focus on patients after mastectomy. The aim of this study was to examine QoL 1 month and 1 year after mastectomy.
   Methods: This cross-sectional single-center study of quality of life was conducted in 101 patients, 50 of whom had undergone a mastectomy 1 month prior, and 51 of whom had undergone a mastectomy 1 year prior. The study was conducted from July 2015 to June 2016. The questionnaires used in the study were developed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). The questionnaire EORTC QLQ-C30 assesses the QoL of cancer patients, and the questionnaire EORTC QLQ-BR23 is a disease-specific breast cancer module. A chi square test, Fisher's exact test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were performed in the statistical analysis using the statistical program SPSS (Inc. Released 2008. SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 17.0. Chicago: SPSS Inc.).
   Results: Patients who had undergone a mastectomy a year earlier placed a higher value on their health state than did those who had undergone a mastectomy a month earlier. The most affected values of functional status on the EORTC QLQ-C30 scale were emotional functioning (37.5 [95% CI 33.3-61.6]) and sexual functioning (16.67 [95% CI 0-33.3]) 1 month and 1 year after mastectomy, respectively. The most affected symptoms on the EORTC QLQ-C30 scale were hair loss 66.67 [95% CI 33.3-100]) and fatigue 33.33 [95% CI 24-44]) 1 month and 1 year after mastectomy, respectively.
   Conclusion: In our study, both functional and symptom scales were more affected in women 1 month after mastectomy. QoL was considerably improved in women 1 year after the surgery compared to 1 month after mastectomy. The results of this study could contribute to the public awareness of the QoL of breast cancer patients.

TI The state of health services partnering with consumers: evidence from an
   online survey of Australian health services
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID MENTAL-HEALTH; COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION; PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION;
   INVOLVEMENT; CARE; PATIENT; EMPOWERMENT; PEOPLE; GOVERNANCE; CHALLENGES
AB Background: Involving consumers in producing health services is mandated in many countries. Evidence indicates consumer partnerships lead to improved service design, quality and innovation. Involving participants from minority groups is crucial because poor understanding of distinctive needs affects individuals' service experiences and outcomes. Few studies consider service compliance with consumer partnering requirements or inclusion of minority group participants.
   Methods: An online survey structured by domains of the Australian National Safety and Quality in Health Service Standards (NSQHS, 2013), was conducted. Questions covered consumer partnering in service planning, management and evaluation plus patient care design and inclusion of consumers from minority groups. Approximately 1200 Australian hospital and day surgery services were identified and 447 individual email addresses were identified for staff leading consumer partnerships. Quantitative data were analysed using SPSS. Qualitative responses, managed in NVivo, were analysed thematically. Frequencies were produced to indicate common activities and range of activities within question domains.
   Results: Comprehensive responses were received from 115 services (25.7%), including metropolitan and non-metropolitan, private and public service settings. Most respondents (95.6%) "partnered with consumers to develop or provide feedback on patient information". Regarding inclusion of participants from minority groups, respondents were least likely to specifically include those from socially disadvantaged backgrounds (23.6%). Public health services were more likely than private services to engage with consumers.
   Conclusions: The survey is the first to include responses about consumer partnering from across Australia. While many respondents partner with consumers, it is clear that more easily-organised activity such as involvement in existing committees or commenting on patient information occurs more commonly than involvement in strategy or governance. This raises questions over whether strategic-level involvement is too difficult or unrealistic; or whether services simply lack tools. Minority views may be missed where there is a lack of specific action to include diversity. Future work might address why services choose the activities we found and probe emerging opportunities, such as using social media or online engagement.

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; RISK-FACTORS; OLDER-PEOPLE; BELIEFS
AB Background
   There is a need to improve public's participation in health checks for early identification of individuals at high risk of CVD for prevention. The objective of this study is to identify significant determinants associated with individuals' intention to undergo CVD health checks. These determinants could be used to develop effective strategies to improve CVD health check participation.
   Methods
   This was a cross sectional survey using mall intercept interviews. It was carried out in a hypermarket surrounded by housing estates with a population of varying socioeconomic backgrounds. Inclusion criteria were Malaysian nationality and age 30 years and older. The validated CVD health check questionnaire was used to assess participants' intention and the determinants that influenced their intention to undergo CVD health checks.
   Results
   A total of 413 participants were recruited. The median age of the participants was 45 years (IQR 17 years) and 60% of them were female. Participants indicated they were likely (45.0%) or very likely (38.7%) to undergo CVD health checks while 16.2% were not sure, unlikely or very unlikely to undergo health checks. Using ordinal regression analysis, perception of benefits, drawbacks of CVD health checks, perception of external barriers and readiness to handle outcomes following CVD health checks were the significant determinants of individuals' intention to undergo CVD health checks.
   Conclusions
   To improve individuals' participation in CVD health checks, we need to develop strategies to address their perception of benefits and drawbacks of CVD health checks, the perceived external barriers and their readiness to handle outcomes following CVD health checks.

TI Estimating the future health and aged care expenditure in Australia with
   changes in morbidity
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID COSTS
AB Aims
   We estimate the pure effect of ageing on total health and aged care expenditure in Australia in the next 20 years.
   Methods
   We use a simple demographic projection model for the number of people in older age groups along with a needs based estimate of changes in the public and private cost of care per person in each group adjusted for expected changes in morbidity.
   Results
   A pure ageing model of expenditure growth predicts an increase in health expenditure per elderly person from $7439 in 2015 to $9594 in 2035 and an increase in total expenditure from $166 billion to $320 billion (an average annual growth of 3.33%). If people live longer without additional morbidity, then total health expenditure only grows at an average annual rate of 0.48%. If only some of those additional years are in good health, then the average year on year growth is 1.87%.
   Conclusion
   Ageing will have a direct effect on the growth of health spending but is likely to be dwarfed by other demand and supply factors. A focus on greater efficiency in health production and finance is likely to be more effective in delivering high quality care than trying to restrain the demand for health and aged care among the elderly.

AB Introduction
   Adolescent pregnancy is a significant cost to mother, newborn, and their family and society. Despite the enormous health and social impact of adolescent pregnancy, there is a dearth of nationally representative studies on factors associated with adolescent pregnancies in Nepal. Therefore, this study aimed to examine trends and factors associated with adolescent pregnancies in Nepal, using pooled data of three nationally representative demographic surveys.
   Methods
   Data for this study was derived from the recent three consecutive (2006, 2011 and 2016) Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys (NDHS). A total of 7,788 adolescent women aged 15-19 years included in the analysis. Trends and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the factors associated with adolescent pregnancy.
   Results
   Over the study period (2006-2016), the rate of adolescent pregnancy was 173 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 159, 188] per 1000 women aged 15-19 years. Adolescent pregnancy was significantly higher among woman with middle household wealth index [adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 2.19, 95% confidence interval CI 1.65, 2.91] or poor household wealth index (aOR 2.37, 95% CI 1.76, 3.21). Similarly, Dalit (aOR 1.87, 95% CI 1.50, 2.34) or Madhesi (aOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.32, 2.11); and unemployed (aOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09, 1.50) women had higher odds of adolescent pregnancies. In contrast, adolescent pregnancy was significantly lower among educated women (aOR 0.60, 95% CI 0.48, 0.74), and women with access to media exposure to public health issues (aOR 0.75, 95% CI 0.64, 0.88).
   Conclusions
   Access to the media exposure on public health issues can be the effective efforts to reduce adolescent pregnancy. Women who have low maternal education, low wealth index, unemployed, and ethnic groups such as Dalits, and Madeshi needs to be targeted while designing and implementing policies and programs.

TI Primary health Centres' performance assessment measures in developing
   countries: review of the empirical literature
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Review
DE Primary health centres; Performance assessment; Developing countries
ID CARE SERVICES; ORGANIZATION; QUALITY; PATIENT; BRAZIL
AB Background: It is universally accepted that primary healthcare is essential for achieving public health and that assessment of its performance is critical for continuous improvement. The World Health Organization's (WHO's) framework for performance assessment is a comprehensive global standard, but difficult to apply in developing countries because of financial and data constraints. This study aims to review the empirical literature on measures for Primary Health Centre (PHC) performance assessment in developing countries, and compare them for comprehensiveness with the aspects described by the WHO Framework.
   Methods: Research articles published in English scientific journals between January 1979 and October 2016 were reviewed systematically. The reporting quality of the article and the quality of the measures were assessed with instruments adapted for the purpose of this study. Data was categorized and described.
   Results: Fifteen articles were included in the study out of 4359 articles reviewed. Nine articles used quantitative methods, one article used qualitative methods exclusively and five used mixed methods. Fourteen articles had a good description of the measurement properties. None of the articles presented validity tests of the measures but eleven articles presented measures that were well established. Mostly studies included components of personnel competencies (skilled/non-skilled) and centre performance (patient satisfaction/cost/efficiency).
   Conclusions: In comparison to the WHO framework, the measures in the articles were limited in scope as they did not represent all service components of PHCs. Hence, PHC performance assessment should include system components along with relevant measures of personnel performance beyond knowledge of protocols. Existing measures for PHC performance assessment in developing countries need to be validated and concise measures for neglected aspects need to be developed.

AB Background: Information leaflets have been shown to significantly improve awareness of the symptoms of gynaecological cancers and to reduce perceived barriers to seeking medical help. This record-based, parallel, randomised control trial study aimed to assess whether receipt of a leaflet would change the behaviour of women experiencing symptoms indicative of gynaecological cancers by prompting them to visit their general practitioner (GP).
   Methods: 15,538 women aged 40 years or over registered with five general practices in Northamptonshire, UK were randomised to two groups using the SystmOne randomise facility. Those in the intervention group received an educational leaflet from their general practice explaining the symptoms of gynaecological cancers and advising symptomatic women to visit their GP. The control group were not contacted. Electronic records were interrogated to extract sociodemographic data and details of GP consultations for symptoms, tests, referrals and diagnoses relating to gynaecological cancers in the 4-month period following the mail-out of the leaflets.
   Results: 7739 records were extracted from the intervention group and 7799 from the control group. 231 (3.0%) of the women in the intervention group, and 207 (2.7%) of the controls, presented to their GP with a relevant symptom during the 4-month period following leaflet distribution. The slightly higher rate in the intervention group did not reach statistical significance at the 5% level (RR =1.11; 95% CI 0.92-1.33; z=1.08; p = 0.28). There was a significantly lower mean time to first presentation in the symptomatic intervention group (57.2 days, sd = 36.5) compared to the control group (65.2 days, sd = 35.0) (t = - 2.415; p = 0.016). Survival analysis did not reveal a difference between the patterns of presentation in the two cohorts (Log Rank (Mantel-Cox) chi(2) = 1.42; p = 0.23).
   Conclusion: There was no difference between intervention and control groups in the proportion of women presenting with symptoms identified in the leaflet in the four months following leaflet distribution, although the women who had been sent a leaflet presented earlier than those in the control group. A larger study is needed to test for a modest effect of leaflet distribution.

AB Background: The prevalence of alcohol consumption among males living in urban settlements in South Africa is high. This paper aims to measure socioeconomic inequalities in alcohol use among men residing in informal settlements and also to examine the factors associated with inequality in alcohol use among men living in informal settlements.
   Methods: The study uses data from the 2016 Study of South African Informal Settlements. Multiple correspondence analysis is used to calculate a wealth index as a measure of socioeconomic status. The Erreygers concentration index is employed to quantify the degree of socioeconomic inequality in alcohol use and decomposition analysis is conducted to assess the factors associated with inequality in alcohol use by men of various age groups.
   Results: There is a socioeconomic-related inequality in alcohol use in informal settlements that discriminates against poor men. Inequality is especially pronounced in the case of males aged 15-34 years and males aged 35-44 years. Wealth status makes the biggest contribution to socioeconomic inequality in alcohol use. The contribution of social determinants of health like marital status and employment status differ across age groups. Employment status contribute more to the alcohol use inequality among males aged 15-34 years while marital status contribute more to the alcohol use inequality among males aged 35-44 years. Being single substantially increases inequality in alcohol use.
   Conclusion: Inequality in alcohol use exists among both younger and older males and discriminate against the poor. Public policies aimed at promoting public health and the prevention of unhealthy behaviours should target younger and middle-aged men from socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. We also suggest policies that target single males in informal settlements.

AB Background: Human animal-bite injuries are a serious public health problem due to associated risk for rabies virus exposure. Animal-bite injuries especially dog bites are useful indicators for assessing the risk of rabies virus transmission and need for rabies post exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Understanding the epidemiology and surveillance of animal bites and rabies post-exposure prophylaxis is critical in implementing Kenya's national rabies elimination strategy. We aimed to describe the incidence of human animal-bite injuries, patient/biting animal characteristics, uptake of rabies PEP and factors associated with animal bite incidents.
   Methods: We reviewed animal bite records from outpatient and anti-rabies vaccine (ARV) registers of 17 health facilities from five counties. An animal bite was defined as an entry of an animal bite of the class mammal including humans in registers in a person of any age from January 2011 to December 2016. We collected demographic and information on PEP uptake. We calculated descriptive statistics, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to examine factors associated with being an animal bite case-patient. We also calculated incidence of animal bites using health facility catchment population for year 2016 as the denominator.
   Results: We analyzed 7307 records. The median age was 22 years (IQR = 31 years); there were 4019 (55%) male and age < 15 years were 2607 (37%). Dogs accounted for 6720 (93%) of bites of which 78% were owned free-roaming dogs. Of the 5674 (88%) cases that received rabies PEP, 2247 (40%) got at least three-doses. The median time from bite to seeking medical care was 2 days (IQR = 4 days). Being bitten on the head/face (OR = 5.8; CI: 3.3-10.2); being bitten by owned free-roaming dog (OR = 1.7; CI: 1.5-1.9) and being male (OR = 1.4; CI: 13-1.5) were significantly associated with being an animal-bite case-patient Being male, being bitten on head/face and being bitten by owned free-roaming dog remained independently associated with being an animal bite case-patient at multivariable logistic regression. Bite-incidence was 289 bites /100,000 persons among all counties.
   Conclusion: Preventing dog bites would most effectively reduce bite injuries by improving public health education among children below 15 years, encouraging early PEP initiation and completion, development and implementation of responsible dog ownership and animal behaviour educational programmes as well as improving human and veterinary health linkages.

DT Article
DE Intimate partner violence; women's status; Community norms; Multilevel
   analysis; Nigeria
ID DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; SPOUSAL VIOLENCE; PREVALENCE; HEALTH; INDIA
AB Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) against women has been recognised as a public health problem with far-reaching consequences for the physical, reproductive, and mental health of women. The ecological framework portrays intimate partner violence as a multifaceted phenomenon, demonstrating the interplay of factors at different levels: individual, community, and the larger society. The present study examined the effect of individual-and community-level factors on IPV in Nigeria, with a focus on women's status and community-level norms among men.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study based on the latest Nigerian Demographic Health Survey (2013) was conducted involving 20,802 ever-partnered women aged 15-49 years. Several multilevel logistic regression models were calibrated to assess the association of individual-and community-level factors with IPV. Both measures of association (fixed effect) and measures of variations (random effect) were reported.
   Results: Almost one in four women in Nigeria reported having ever experienced intimate partner violence. Having adjusted for other relevant covariates, higher women's status reduced the odds of IPV (OR = 0.47; 95% CI = 0. 32-0.71). However, community norms among men that justified IPV against women modified the observed protective effect of higher women's status against IPV and reversed the odds (OR = 1.89; 95% CI = 1.26-2.83).
   Conclusions: Besides women's status, community norms towards IPV are an important factor for the occurrence of IPV. Thus, addressing intimate partner violence against women calls for community-wide approaches aimed at changing norms among men alongside improving women's status.

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID DRUG SHORTAGES
AB The circulation of poor quality medicines, especially in the developing countries, is a public health concern. Compliance with good manufacturing practices (GMP) is essential to ensure the quality, efficacy, and safety of medicines. This study evaluated the outcomes of the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency's (ANVISA) international inspections of two years (2015 and 2016) and compared these to those of other regulatory authorities. The information from 255 inspection reports was analyzed, and the type and extent of deficiencies were collected. In the period evaluated, 62.75% of ANVISA-inspected companies were classified as GMP "satisfactory," 24.71% were classified as having "on demand" status, and 12.55% of inspections concluded that the company did not comply with Brazilian GMP regulations ("unsatisfactory"). The most common areas of deficiency were documentation (28.63%) and premises (26.27%). The pattern of deficiencies was similar to the findings of other regulatory agencies. However, ANVISA detected a more significant number of non-compliance results than other authorities, which may be caused by differences in classifications adopted by each Agency. Furthermore, manufacturers inspected by ANVISA may follow different standards and practices for products manufactured for the Brazilian market. Disclosure of main GMP deficiencies found can be useful for encouraging the industry to comply with GMP, and additional guidelines in the specific areas where deficiencies are often identified may be useful to industry to improve GMP compliance. Harmonization of GMP guidelines and inspection procedures are the key steps to avoid duplicate work, but regulatory authorities also need to work together to enforce the proper level of GMP compliance by pharmaceutical manufacturers, assuring high quality and safe medicines supply.

ID HEALTH-CARE; STUDENTS
AB Introduction
   In the health sector, questions are being raised about the possible threats to the accepted principles of ethics such as autonomy, beneficence, non malfeasance and justice in the delivery of health care. There is limited information in Ethiopia regarding to practice of code of ethics among medical doctors. Hence, this study aimed to assess practice of code of ethics and associated factors among medical doctors working in governmental and private hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
   Methods
   Institution based cross sectional quantitative study triangulated with qualitative study was conducted among 500 medical doctors working in governmental and private hospitals and three key informants from Federal Ministry of Health, Ethiopian Food, Medicine and Healthcare Administration and Control Authority and Ethiopian Medical Association in Addis Ababa from May 8, 2017 to June 30, 2017. Data were collected using pretested self-administered structured questionnaire and semi-structured questionnaire. Binary Logistic Regression and Content Analysis methods were used for the quantitative and qualitative data analysis respectively.
   Results
   The study showed that only 152 (30.4%) of medical doctors had good practice of code of ethics. The odds of having good practice of code of ethics among medical doctors in the age group of 25-29 years were 2.749 times the odds of those in the age group of 30-34 years (AOR = 2.749, 95% CI: 1.483, 5.096), medical doctors working in governmental hospitals were 65.4% less likely to have good practice of code of ethics compared to those working in private hospitals (AOR = 0.346, 95% CI: 0.184, 0.652), knowledgeable medical doctors were 83.5% more likely to have good practice of code of ethics compared to those who were not knowledgeable about code of ethics (AOR = 1.835, 95% CI: 0.999, 3.368), and the odds of having good practice of code of ethics among medical doctors with favourable attitude were 7.404 times the odds of those with unfavourable attitude towards code of ethics (AOR = 7.404, 95% CI: 4.254, 12.887). Furthermore lack of motivation, unfavorable working environment, working at various health facilities simultaneously, public awareness, taking courses on medical ethics, lack of unethical conduct reporting and complaint handling system, incompetence of medical doctors, and weak collaboration among key stakeholders were identified as determinants of practice of code of ethics.
   Conclusions
   Only 30.4% of medical doctors had good practice of code of ethics. This indicates that practice of code of ethics among medical doctors in Addis Ababa is poor. The factors associated with practice of code of ethics were age, type of hospital, knowledge, attitude, lack of motivation, unfavorable working environment, working at various health facilities simultaneously, public awareness, medical ethics course, lack of unethical conduct reporting and compliant handling system, incompetence of medical doctors and weak collaboration among key stakeholders. Hence, awareness creation and attitudinal change on code of ethics by continuous training, implementation of integrated medical ethics course, enforcement of code of ethics and continuing professional development (CPD) implementation are important.

AB Predicting species distributions requires substantial numbers of georeferenced occurrences and access to remotely sensed climate and land cover data. Reliable estimates of the distribution of most species are unavailable, either because digitized georeferenced distributional data are rare or not digitized. The emergence of online biodiversity information databases and citizen science platforms dramatically improves the amount of information available to establish current and historical distribution of lesser-documented species. We demonstrate how the combination of museum and online citizen science databases can be used to build reliable distribution maps for poorly documented species. To do so, we investigated the distribution and the potential range expansions of two north-eastern North American spider species (Arachnida: Araneae), the Northern black widow (Latrodectus variolus) and the Black purse-web spider (Sphodros niger). Our results provide the first predictions of distribution for these two species. We also found that the Northern black widow has expanded north of its previously known range providing valuable information for public health education. For the Black purse-web spider, we identify potential habitats outside of its currently known range, thus providing a better understanding of the ecology of this poorly-documented species. We demonstrate that increasingly available online biodiversity databases are rapidly expanding biogeography research for conservation, ecology, and in specific cases, epidemiology, of lesser known taxa.

TI Epidemiological and genomic determinants of tuberculosis outbreaks in

SO BMC MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article

ID MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; SEQUENCING DATA; TRANSMISSION; POPULATION;
   DISCOVERY; VACCINE
AB Background: In Canada, tuberculosis disproportionately affects foreign-born and First Nations populations. Within First Nations' peoples, a high proportion of cases occur in association with outbreaks. Tuberculosis transmission in the context of outbreaks is thought to result from the convergence of several factors including characteristics of the cases, contacts, the environment, and the pathogen.
   Methods: We examined the epidemiological and genomic determinants of two well-characterized tuberculosis outbreaks attributed to two super-spreaders among First Nations in the province of Alberta. These outbreaks were associated with two distinct DNA fingerprints (restriction fragment-length polymorphisms or RFLPs 0.0142 and 0.0728). We compared outbreak isolates with endemic isolates not spatio-temporarily linked to outbreak cases. We extracted epidemiological variables pertaining to tuberculosis cases and contacts from individual public health records and the provincial tuberculosis registry. We conducted group analyses using parametric and non-parametric statistical tests. We carried out whole-genome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis using validated protocols.
   Results: We observed differences between outbreak and endemic groups in the mean number of total and child-aged contacts and the number of contacts with new positive and converted tuberculin skin tests in all group comparisons (p < 0.05). Differences were also detected in the proportion of cases with cavitation on a chest radiograph and the mean number of close contacts in relected group comparisons (p < 0.02). A phylogenetic network analysis of whole-genome sequencing data indicated that most outbreak and endemic strains were closely related to the source case for the 0.0142 fingerprint. For the 0.0728 fingerprint, the source case haplotype was circulating among endemic cases prior to the outbreak Genetic and temporal distances were not correlated for either RFLP 0.0142 (r(2) = - 0.05) or RFLP 0.0728 (r(2) = 0.09) when all isolates were analyzed.
   Conclusions: We found no evidence that endemic strains acquired mutations resulting in their emergence in outbreak form. We conclude that the propagation of these outbreaks was likely driven by the combination of characteristics of the source cases, contacts, and the environment The role of whole-genome sequencing in understanding mycobacterial evolution and in assisting public health authorities in conducting contact investigations and managing outbreaks is important and expected to grow in the future.

DE Malaria; Prevalence; Retrospective; Woreta; Ethiopia
ID KENYA; AREA
AB Background: Data on trends in malaria prevalence is significant to assist efforts in the control and prevention of the disease. This retrospective study was, therefore, aimed to determine the prevalence of malaria in Woreta town, northwestern Ethiopia over 8 years.
   Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in Woreta town, northwestern Ethiopia, from November to January 2013. Eight years (2005 to 2012) health center record of malaria cases was reviewed. Odds ratio (OR) was used to determine trend in malaria prevalence with respect to age, sex and Plasmodium species. P-values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
   Results: From 2005 to 2012, a total of 102,520 suspected cases of malaria were reported at Woreta health center. Of these, 33,431 (32.6%) were microscopically confirmed to be positive for the disease. Among these positive cases, 17,700 (52.9%) and 15,731 (47.1%) were males and females, respectively. Children less than 5 years old were 13 times more likely to be infected by malaria than those with 5-15 years ([0R]; 13, 95% confidence interval [Cl]; 1.26-134, p < 0.001). There was higher percentage (69.7%) of Plasmodium falciparum infection than Plasmodium vivax (26.5%); and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). There was fluctuation in yearly malaria prevalence with a minimum of 7% in 2008 and maximum of 47% in 2005.
   Conclusions: The present study revealed that malaria continued to be one of the major public health problems in Woreta town, northwest Ethiopia. Moreover, there was no successive yearly reduction in its prevalence. Therefore, efforts are required to reduce the disease burden through continuous monitoring and evaluation of control measures in the study area.

AB Background: Despite some improvements towards reducing hunger, malnutrition remains to be a crucial challenge in the developing world. The objective of this paper is to analyze the interplay between production diversity and dietary diversity across different seasons in rural Nigeria. The paper also investigates the relationship across different income quantiles.
   Method: The study uses the Living Standards Measurement Study - Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) dataset of the World Bank We use two rounds of survey data (2010 and 2012) from Nigeria. Data were collected in two visits: at post-planting (from September to November), and at post-harvesting (from February to April). We analyze the relationship between production diversity and dietary diversity using different panel data regression tools.
   Result In post-harvest season, an increase in farm production diversification is associated with an increase with dietary diversity. On the other hand, production diversification does not have a significant contribution to the dietary diversity at post-planting. The analysis reveals that production diversification leads to better diet diversity for households in the second and third income quantiles.
   Conclusion: Seasonal variation on the contribution of production diversification on dietary diversity in rural Nigeria calls for the role of seasonally targeted policies. A higher propensity of households in the poorest quantile for malnutrition irrespective of the season suggests the need for targeted and continuous public health and nutrition interventions.

DE Migration; Health; Global health; Research
ID POLICY
AB Background: With 244 million international migrants, and significantly more people moving within their country of birth, there is an urgent need to engage with migration at all levels in order to support progress towards global health and development targets. In response to this, the 2nd Global Consultation on Migration and Health - held in Colombo, Sri Lanka in February 2017 - facilitated discussions concerning the role of research in supporting evidence-informed health responses that engage with migration.
   Conclusions: Drawing on discussions with policy makers, research scholars, civil society, and United Nations agencies held in Colombo, we emphasize the urgent need for quality research on international and domestic (in-country) migration and health to support efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs aim to 'leave no-one behind' irrespective of their legal status. An ethically sound human rights approach to research that involves engagement across multiple disciplines is required. Researchers need to be sensitive when designing and disseminating research findings as data on migration and health may be misused, both at an individual and population level. We emphasize the importance of creating an 'enabling environment' for migration and health research at national, regional and global levels, and call for the development of meaningful linkages - such as through research reference groups - to support evidence-informed inter-sectoral policy and priority setting processes.

DE eHealth; Telemedicine; Teledermatology; Scale-up requirements; Scale-up

ID TELEMEDICINE; AFRICA
AB Background: The South African public health sector embarked on a National Telemedicine System implementation program in 1999 and although unsuccessful, the Province of KwaZulu-Natal subsequently implemented teledermatology in 2003, with two currently active services (synchronous and asynchronous). Although sustained these have not been scaled-up to meet the needs of all hospitals in the Province. A recent teledermatology scale-up design requirements elicitation process within KwaZulu-Natal confirmed the need for a framework, and identified requirements through key stakeholders, programme observations, the literature, and experts. This study aimed to identify and characterise existing teledermatology or related eHealth scale-up frameworks, determine whether any met the previously elicited scale-up framework requirements, and were suitable for use in the KwaZulu-Natal public health sector.
   Methods: A structured literature search was performed of electronic databases (Scopus, Science Direct, IEEE, PubMed, and Google Scholar) seeking proposed or developed teledermatology or related scale-up frameworks. Global public health publications were also hand-searched. The teledermatology or telemedicine, telehealth or eHealth related scale-up frameworks identified were critiqued against the previously elicited teledermatology scale-up framework requirements to determine their suitability for use.
   Results: No specific teledermatology scale-up framework was found. Seven related scale-up frameworks were identified, although none met all the previously identified teledermatology scale-up framework requirements. The identified frameworks were designed for specific scale-up phases and lacked a more holistic and comprehensive approach.
   Conclusions: There is an evidenced-based need for the development of a health sector aligned, holistic framework that meets the identified teledermatology scale-up framework requirements. The findings of this paper will inform development of such a framework.

TI Prevalence of anemia among Lebanese hospitalized children: Risk and
   protective factors
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID IRON-DEFICIENCY; INFANTS; SUPPLEMENTATION
AB Background
   Anemia is a global health problem associated with short- and long-term consequences especially in children. The incidence of anemia along with the factors associated with its increased or decreased risk is not yet well studied in Lebanon. Our study aims at determining the demographics of this health burden and identifying some of the important factors linked to it among the pediatric population.
   Methods
   A 4-months cross-sectional study was performed between August and November 2017 including 295 children aged 1 month to 12 years, who were hospitalized in a tertiary care hospital located in South Lebanon. We analyzed the different demographic data, age, gender, breast feeding duration, solid food introduction, iron supplementation and disease of diagnosis in association with multiple hematological parameters.
   Results
   The prevalence of both mild and moderate anemia was 71.8 and 25.4%, with only 2 cases of severe anemia encountered among children aged 6 months or above. Results showed that the risk of anemia increases by around 3.4 folds among malnourished children than in well-nourished children. This risk also decreased by almost 42% in children receiving iron supplement.
   Conclusion
   In consideration to the fact that anemia is a prevalent disease in the Lebanese childhood population, especially in infancy, simple preventive measures such as proper nutritional habits and supplementation of iron rich food to children are highly recommended and should be respected by public health providers.

AB Background: In South Africa (SA), liver cancer (LC) is a public health problem and information is limited.
   Methods: Joinpoint regression analysis was computed for the most recent LC mortality data from Statistics South Africa (StatsSA), by age group, sex and population group. The mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs) were calculated as the age-adjusted mortality rate divided by the age-adjusted incidence rate.
   Results: From 1999 to 2015, the overall LC mortality significantly decreased in men (- 4.9%) and women (- 2.7%). Overall a significant decrease was noted in black African men aged 20-29 and 40 49 years, and white women older than 60 years but mortality rates increased among 50-59 and 60-69 year old black African men (from 2010/2009-2015) and women (from 2004/2009-2015). The mortality rates increased with age, and were higher among blacks Africans compared to whites in all age groups - with a peak black African-to-white mortality rate ratio of six in men and three in women at ages 30-39 years. The average MIR for black African men and women was 4 and 3.3 respectively, and 2.2 and 1.8 in their white counterparts. Moreover, decreasing LC mortality rates among younger and the increase in rates in older black Africans suggest that the nadir of the disease may be near or may have passed.
   Conclusions: Findings of population-age subgroup variations in LC mortality and the number of underdiagnosed cases can inform surveillance efforts, while more extensive investigations of the aetiological risk factors are needed. Impact: There was a large race, sex and age differences in trends of LC mortality in SA. These findings should inform more extensive evaluation of the aetiology and risk factors of LC in the country in order to guide control efforts.

AB Background: Herpes simplex virus infection is a global health concern with disproportionately high burden in low and middle-income countries. There is a paucity of data on the prevalence of HSV infection in Ghana, which necessitated the present study.
   The aim of the study was to provide up-to-date data on sero-prevalence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection among women attending Cervicare clinics in Ghana.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study in which 380 women attending routine Cervicare clinics at Regional Hospitals in Kumasi and Accra, Ghana were enrolled into the study. Serum HSV-1 IgG and HSV-2 IgG were determined by ELISA method. The Chi-square test was used to investigate the association between sero-prevalence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 and socio-demographic and behavioral factors using the Statistical Package for the Social Scientists (SPSS) version 22. Statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05.
   Results: The overall HSV-1 and HSV-2 sero-prevalence estimates were 99.2% (95% CI: 98.0-100%) and 78.4% (95% CI: 74.5-81.8%) respectively. The study observed 78.2% cross-positive prevalence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 among the studied participants. There was no association between the presence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection and age (chi(2) = 2.351, p = 0.799 and chi(2) = 1.655, p = 0.895 respectively). Our findings however, revealed association between the prevalence of HSV-2 and the age at coitarche (p = 0.021) as well as with number of sexual partners (p = 0.022).
   Conclusions: The sero-prevalence estimates of HSV-1 and HSV-2 among the study population of women in Ghana were found to be high. This high prevalence could be attributed to high endemicity and inadequate intervention in this population. There is the need to raise awareness through organized public health screening and education to ensure control.

ID GOLD IN-TUBE; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; CHILDREN;
   SKIN; CARE; UK; PERFORMANCE; VACCINATION; IMMIGRANTS
AB Background: Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be a global public health concern. Due to the presence of multiple risk factors such as poor housing conditions and food insecurity in Canadian Indigenous communities, this population is at particularly high risk of TB infection. Given the challenges of screening for latent TB infection (LTBI) in remote communities, a synthesis of the existing literature regarding current screening strategies among high-risk groups in low-incidence countries is warranted, in order to provide an evidence base for the optimization of paediatric LTBI screening practices in the Canadian Indigenous context.
   Methods: A literature search of the Embase and Medline databases was conducted, and studies pertaining the evaluation of screening strategies or screening tools for LTBI in paediatric high-risk groups in low-incidence countries were included. Studies focusing on LTBI screening in Indigenous communities were also included, regardless of whether they focused on a paediatric population. Their results were summarized and discussed in the context of their relevance to screening strategies suitable to the Canadian Indigenous setting. Grey literature sources such as government reports or policy briefs were also consulted.
   Results: The initial literature search returned 327 studies, with 266 being excluded after abstract screening, and 36 studies being included in the final review (original research studies: n = 25, review papers or policy recommendations: n = 11). In the examined studies, case identification and cost-effectiveness of universal screening were low in low-incidence countries. Therefore, studies generally recommended targeted screening of high-risk groups in low-incidence countries, however, there remains a lack of consensus regarding cut-offs for the incidence-based screening of high-risk communities, as well as regarding the utility and prioritization of individual risk-factor-based screening of high-risk groups. The utility of the TST compared to IGRAs for LTBI detection in the pediatric population also remains contested.
   Conclusions: Relevant strategies for targeted screening in the Canadian Indigenous context include community-level incidence-based screening (screening based on geographic location within high-incidence communities), as well as individual risk-factor-based screening, taking into account pertinent risk factors in Indigenous settings, such as poor housing conditions, malnutrition, contact with an active case, or the presence of relevant co-morbidities, such as renal disease.

TI Understanding variations in health insurance coverage in Ghana, Kenya,
   Nigeria, and Tanzania: Evidence from demographic and health surveys
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SUBSCRIPTION; WOMEN; CARE
AB Background
   Realisation of universal health coverage is not possible without health financing systems that ensure financial risk protection. To ensure this, some African countries have instituted health insurance schemes as venues for ensuring universal access to health care for their populace. In this paper, we examined variations in health insurance coverage in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Tanzania.
   Methods
   We used data from demographic and health surveys of Ghana (2014), Kenya (2014), Nigeria (2013), and Tanzania (2015). Women aged 15-49 and men aged 15-59 years were included in the study. Our study population comprised 9,378 women and 4,371 men from Ghana, 14,656 women and 12,712 men from Kenya, 38,598 women and 17,185 men from Nigeria, and 10,123 women and 2,514 men from Tanzania. Bivariate and multivariate techniques were used to analyse the data.
   Results
   Coverage was highest in Ghana (Females = 62.4%, Males = 49.1%) and lowest in Nigeria (Females = 1.1%, Males = 3.1%). Age, level of education, residence, wealth status, and occupation were the socio-economic factors influencing variations in health insurance coverage.
   Conclusions
   There are variations in health insurance coverage in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Tanzania, with Ghana recording the highest coverage. Kenya, Tanzania, and Nigeria may not be able to achieve universal health coverage and meet the sustainable development goals on health by the year 2030 if the current fragmented public health insurance systems persist in those countries. Therefore, the various schemes of these countries should be harmonised to help maximise the size of their risk pools and increase the confidence of potential subscribers in the systems, which may encourage them to enrol.

AB Background: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are increasing in prevalence in low-income countries including Uganda. The Uganda Ministry of Health has prioritized NCD prevention, early diagnosis, and management. However, research on the capacity of public sector health facilities to address NCDs is limited.
   Methods: We developed a survey guided by the literature and the standards of the World Health Organization Pacakage of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions for Primary Health Care in Low-Resource Settings. We used this tool to conduct a needs assessment in 53 higher-level public sector facilities throughout Uganda, including all Regional Referral Hospitals (RRH) and a purposive sample of General Hospitals (GH) and Health Centre IVs (HCIV), to: (1) assess their capacity to detect and manage NCDs; (2) describe provider knowledge and practices regarding the management of NCDs; and (3) identify areas in need of focused improvement. We collected data on human resources, equipment, NCD screening and management, medicines, and laboratory tests. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize our findings.
   Results: We identified significant resource gaps at all sampled facilities. All facilities reported deficiencies in NCD screening and management services. Less than half of all RRH and GH had an automated blood pressure machine. The only laboratory test uniformly available at all surveyed facilities was random blood glucose. Sub-specialty NCD clinics were available in some facilities with the most common type being a diabetes clinic present at eleven (85%) RRHs. These facilities offered enhanced services to patients with diabetes. Surveyed facilities had limited use of NCD patient registries and NCD management guidelines. Most facilities (46% RRH, 23% GH, 7% HCIV) did not track patients with NCDs by using registries and only 4 (31%) RRHs, 4 (15%) GHs, and 1 (7%) HCIVs had access to diabetes management guidelines.
   Conclusions: Despite inter-facility variability, none of the facilities in our study met the WHO-PEN standards for essential tools and medicines to implement effective NCD interventions. In Uganda, improvements in the allocation of human resources and essential medicines and technologies, coupled with uptake in the use of quality assurance modalities are desperately needed in order to adequately address the rapidly growing NCD burden.

AB Bivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine was incorporated into the childhood vaccination calendar in Galicia, Spain in 2008. The objectives of this study were to estimate direct, indirect and total effectiveness of HPV vaccine and to identify sexual habits changes in the post-vaccination period in Galicia, Spain.Endocervical scrapings of 745 women attending 7 Health Areas of the Galician Public Health Service were collected in the post-vaccination period, from 2014-2017. Two groups were studied: women born between 1989 and 1993 (n = 397) and women born in 1994 or later (n = 348). Twelve high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) genotypes were detected by Cobas (R) 4800 HPV test (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The Linear Array (R) HPV Genotyping Test (Roche Diagnostics) was used for HR-HPV genotype detection other than HPV 16/18. Information about sexual habits was collected by a self-filled questionnaire. Post-vaccination data were compared to previously published pre-vaccination data obtained between 2008 and 2010 in Galicia from women of the same age (18-26 years old, n = 523). The Stata 14.2 software was employed for statistical analyses.Data from 392 unvaccinated and 353 vaccinated women were compared. For unvaccinated and vaccinated women, HPV 16/18 prevalence was 9.2% and 0.8%, respectively, and HPV 31/33/45 prevalence was 8.4% and 1.1%, respectively. Direct, indirect and total effectiveness of the HPV vaccine were (%, 95% CI): 94 (72-99), 30 (-11-56) and 95 (79-99), respectively, for HPV 16/18 and 83 (46-94), -10 (-88-33) and 84 (54-94), respectively, for HPV 31/33/45. The number of women with first intercourse before 17 years old and 3 or more sexual partners along life was higher in the post-vaccination period p< 0.05). A positive impact of bivalent HPV vaccine was observed, both on direct and cross protection. Sexual habits could have changed in the post-vaccination period.

AB Objective
   To determine the effectiveness of an individually-tailored multifactorial intervention in reducing falls among at risk older adult fallers in a multi-ethnic, middle-income nation in South-East Asia.
   Design
   Pragmatic, randomized-controlled trial.
   Setting
   Emergency room, medical outpatient and primary care clinic in a teaching hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
   Participants
   Individuals aged 65 years and above with two or more falls or one injurious fall in the past 12 months.
   Intervention
   Individually-tailored interventions, included a modified Otago exercise programme, HOME-FAST home hazards modification, visual intervention, cardiovascular intervention, medication review and falls education, was compared against a control group involving conventional treatment.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures
   The primary outcome was any fall recurrence at 12-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes were rate of fall and time to first fall.
   Results
   Two hundred and sixty-eight participants (mean age 75.3 +/- 7.2 SD years, 67% women) were randomized to multifactorial intervention (n = 134) or convention treatment (n = 134). All participants in the intervention group received medication review and falls education, 92 (68%) were prescribed Otago exercises, 86 (64%) visual intervention, 64 (47%) home hazards modification and 51 (38%) cardiovascular intervention. Fall recurrence did not differ between intervention and control groups at 12-months [Risk Ratio, RR = 1.037 (95% CI 0.613-1.753)]. Rate of fall [RR = 1.155 (95% CI 0.846-1.576], time to first fall [Hazard Ratio, HR = 0.948 (95% CI 0.782-1.522)] and mortality rate [RR = 0.896 (95% CI 0.335-2.400)] did not differ between groups.
   Conclusion
   Individually-tailored multifactorial intervention was ineffective as a strategy to reduce falls. Future research efforts are now required to develop culturally-appropriate and affordable methods of addressing this increasingly prominent public health issue in middle-income nations.

TI Epidemiology of patients presenting to a pediatric emergency department
   in Karachi, Pakistan
SO BMC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Global health; Pediatric emergency medicine; Epidemiology; Outcomes;

ID INCOME COUNTRIES; CARE
AB Background: There is little data describing pediatric emergencies in resource-poor countries, such as Pakistan. We studied the demographics, management, and outcomes of patients presenting to the highest-volume, public, pediatric emergency department (ED) in Karachi, Pakistan.
   Methods: In this prospective, observational study, we approached all patients presenting to the 50-bed ED during 28 12-h study periods over four consecutive weeks (July 2013). Participants' chief complaints and medical care were documented. Patients were followed-up at 48-h and 14-days via telephone.
   Results: Of 3115 participants, 1846 were triaged to the outpatient department and 1269 to the ED. Patients triaged to the ED had a median age of 2.0 years (IQR 0.5-4.0); 30% were neonates (< 28 days). Top chief complaints were fever (45.5%), diarrhea/vomiting (32.3%), respiratory (23.1%), abdominal (7.5%), and otolaryngological problems (5.8%). Temperature, pulse and respiratory rate, and blood glucose were documented for 66, 42, and 1.5% of patients, respectively. Interventions included medications (92%), IV fluids (83%), oxygen (35%), and advanced airway management (5%). Forty-five percent of patients were admitted; 11 % left against medical advice. Outcome data was available at time of ED disposition, 48-h, and 14 days for 83, 62, and 54% of patients, respectively. Of participants followed-up, 4.3% died in the ED, 11.5% within 48 h, and 19.6% within 14 days.
   Conclusions: This first epidemiological study at Pakistan's largest pediatric ED reveals dramatically high mortality, particularly among neonates. Future research in developing countries should focus on characterizing reasons for high mortality through pre-ED arrival tracking, ED care quality assessment, and post-ED follow-up.

TI Self-rated health and its association with perceived environmental

   environmental justice population
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID NEIGHBORHOOD ENVIRONMENT; TRAFFIC NOISE; EXPOSURE; DISCRIMINATION;
   SYMPTOMS; ADULTS; CRIME; RISK; LIFE
AB Background: Communities with large minority populations often are located near sources of pollution and have higher crime rates, which may work in combination with other factors to influence health. Poor self-rated health is related to chronic health conditions and premature mortality, with minority populations most likely to report poor health. To address how both resident perception of neighborhood environments and chronic health conditions individually and collectively influence health, we examined self-rated health and its association with multiple types of perceived environmental hazards in a majority-Hispanic urban population.
   Methods: We conducted interviews with 354 residents of Chelsea, Massachusetts, US and asked about self-rated health, perceptions of their neighborhood, including participant-reported environmental hazards (e.g., air quality, odors and noise), aspects of the social environment (e.g., feeling safe, neighborhood crime, social cohesion), and culture-related stressors (e.g., immigration status, language stress, ethnic identity). Log-linear models examined the independent and multivariable associations between these factors and fair/poor self-rated health, controlling for socio-demographic characteristics and preexisting health conditions.
   Results: Forty-one percent of participants reported fair/poor self-rated health. Participants frequently perceived environmental hazards such as problems with pests and regular noise disturbance as well as feeling unsafe. In a multivariable model, a greater number of reported noise disturbances (>= 2 noise sources = 1.53 [1.04-2.26]) and reported insecurity with immigration status (1.66 [1.01-2.73]) were positively associated with fair/poor self-rated health. High social cohesion was inversely associated (0.74 [0.48-1.14]) with fair/poor self-rated health in the multivariable model.
   Conclusions: Negative perceptions of environmental hazards and reported cultural stressors were significantly associated with fair/poor self-rated health among residents in a low-income majority-minority community, with social cohesion having a beneficial association with self-rated health. Efforts to improve health should recognize the importance of public perceptions of social and environmental hazards found in neighborhood environments, and benefits of strengthening community connections.

ID CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATION; FULL VACCINATION; DETERMINANTS; COVERAGE
AB Background: Inadequate immunization coverage remains a public health problem in Africa. In Togo, only 62% of children under one year of age were fully immunized in 2013. This study aimed to estimate the immunization coverage among children aged 12-23 months, and to identify factors associated with incomplete immunization status in Togo.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in the six health regions of Togo. Children aged 12 to 23 months who were living with one of their parents or guardians from selected households were recruited for the study. Data was collected using a pre-tested questionnaire through face-to-face interviews. Multilevel logistic regression analyses were performed to assess factors associated with incomplete immunization coverage.
   Results: A total of 1261 households were included. Respondents were predominantly women (91.9%) and 22.8% had secondary or higher education level. Immunization cards were available for 85.3% of children. Complete immunization coverage was 72.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI): [69.7-74.8]). After controlling for both individual and contextual level variables, children whose mothers attended secondary school or above were 33% (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) = 0.67, CI [0.47-0.94]) less likely to have an incomplete immunization coverage compared to those with no education. The likelihood of incomplete immunization in children decreased with the increase in household's income (aOR = 0.73, 95% CI [0.58-0.93]), children who did not have an immunization card (aOR = 13.41, 95% CI [9.19-19.57]) and those whose parents did not know that children immunization was free of charge (aOR = 1.82, 95% CI [1.00-3.30]) were more likely to have an incomplete immunization. Finally, children whose parents had to walk half an hour to one hour to reach a healthcare center were 57% (aOR = 1.57, 95% CI [1.15-2.13]) more likely to have an incomplete immunization coverage than those whose parents had to walk less than half an hour.
   Conclusion: The goal of 90% coverage at the national level has not been achieved in 2017. Innovative strategies such as using electronic cards and strengthening sensitization activities must be initiated in order to attain a complete immunization coverage in Togo.

AB Introduction
   A hidden determinant such as intimate partner violence victimization has been associated with under-five morbidity and mortality. However, there is lack of information regarding which exactly age group of under-five is more vulnerable to morbidity when their mothers exposed to intimate partner violence victimization. This study aimed to determine the effect of mothers' exposure to intimate partner violence victimization on age groups specific under-five morbidity that could lead to mortality.
   Material and methods
   The current study pooled and analyzed data from 2010 and 2016 Tanzania Demographic Health Survey datasets. We used a stratified multilevel modeling to assess the association between under-five morbidity and intimate partner violence victimization according to age groups. The Statistical approach using Stata 14 was used to adjust for clustering effect and weighted the estimates to correct for non-responses and disproportionate sampling employed during designing of the surveys.
   Results
   A total of 13,639 singleton live-births babies within three years prior to interview dates from the ever-married women were included in the analysis. We found a significant reduction of the three main symptoms of under-five morbidity namely; a cough with difficult or fast breathing from 21.7 to 15.7%, fever from 22.5 to 18.3%, and diarrhoea from 15.5 to 12.7% for the survey years from 2010 to 2016 respectively (P<0.05). Overall, about 40% of mothers reported experiencing any forms of intimate partner violence victimization. After adjusting for individual and cluster variables, we found that under-five in post-neonatal period
   Conclusion
   This analysis revealed that intimate partner violence victimization is still a major and public health problem in Tanzania that threatens child health during the period of post-neonatal and childhood. There is a need to introduce screening for intimate partner violence victimization in maternal and child care for effective monitoring and prevention of the problem.

AB Breast cancer early detection is the major strategy for mortality rates reduction. In Brazil, Primary Health Care is an important strategy for public health promotion. To analyse the association between breast cancer mortality and primary health care indicators in Brazilian municipalities, data on breast cancer mortality and primary healthcare coverage of the 5,700 Brazilian municipalities were collected from the Department of Informatics of the Brazilian Unified Health System. We collected data on the deaths of women living in Brazil in 2010 with breast cancer. Breast cancer mortality was calculated by 100,000 women and age-standardised from the World Health Organisation population. We studied the coverage of primary health care, family health team and community health agents. We found that increase of both primary care indexes was related to increasing of the breast cancer mortality. Additionally, improving the scholarly and reducing the income inequality was related to reducing the breast cancer mortality. Strategies to improve the quality of primary care, reduce the income inequality and improve elementary scholarly should be taken into account in the development of public policies in the Brazilian municipalities to reduce breast cancer in Brazilian municipalities.

TI Development of an automated image analysis protocol for quantification
   of intracellular forms of Leishmania spp
SO PLOS ONE

ID AMASTIGOTE FORMS; DONOVANI; DRUGS; ASSAY
AB Leishmania parasites cause a set of neglected tropical diseases with considerable public health impact, the leishmaniases, which are often fatal if left untreated. Since current treatments for the leishmaniases exhibit high toxicity, low efficacy and prohibitive prices, many laboratories throughout the world are engaged in research for the discovery of novel chemotherapeutics. This entails the necessity of screening large numbers of compounds against the clinically relevant form of the parasite, the obligatory intracellular amastigote, a procedure that in many laboratories is still carried out by manual inspection. To overcome this well-known bottleneck in Leishmania drug development, several studies have recently attempted to automate this process. Here we implemented an image-based high content triage assay for Leishmania which has the added advantages of using primary macrophages instead of macrophage cell lines and of enabling identification of active compounds against parasite species developing both in small individual phagolysosomes (such as L.infantum) and in large communal vacuoles (such as L.amazonensis). The automated image analysis protocol is made available for IN Cell Analyzer systems, and, importantly, also for the open-source CellProfiler software, in this way extending its implementation to any laboratory involved in drug development as well as in other aspects of Leishmania research requiring analysis of in vitro infected macrophages.

TI Quality and technical efficiency do not evolve hand in hand in Spanish
   hospitals: Observational study with administrative data
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article

   INDICATORS; BENCHMARKING
AB Objective
   Recent evidence on the Spanish National Health System (SNHS) reveals a considerable margin for hospital efficiency and quality improvement. However, those studies do not consider both dimensions together. This study aims at jointly studying both technical efficiency (TE) and quality, classifying the public SNHS hospitals according to their joint performance.
   Methods
   Stochastic frontier analysis is used to estimate TE and multilevel logistic regressions to build a low-quality composite measure (LQ), which considers in-hospital mortality and safety events. All hospitalizations discharged in Spain in 2003 and 2013, in 179 acute-care general hospitals, were studied. Four scenarios of resulting performance were built setting yearly medians as thresholds for the overall sample, and according to hospital-complexity strata.
   Results
   Overall, since 2003, median TE improved and LQ reduced -from TE2003:0.89 to TE2013:0.93 and, from LQ(2003):42.6 to LQ(2013):27.7 per 1,000 treated patients. The time estimated coefficient showed technical progress over the period. TE across hospitals showed scarce variability (CV2003:0.08 vs. CV2013:0.07), not so the rates of LQ (CV2003:0.64 vs. CV2013:0.76). No correlation was found between TE values and LQ rates. When jointly considering technical efficiency and quality, hospitals dealing with the highest clinical complexity showed the highest chance to be placed in optimal scenarios, also showing lesser variability between hospitals.
   Conclusions
   Efficiency and quality have improved in Spanish public hospitals. Not all hospitals experiencing improvements in efficiency equally improved their quality. The joint analysis of both dimensions allowed identifying those optimal hospitals according to this trade-off.

   COLLECTION; SOUND; AUSTRALIA; BEHAVIOR; CAPTURE; SENSORS
AB The Aedes aegypti mosquito is a primary vector of several serious arboviruses throughout the world and is therefore of great concern to many public health organizations. With vector control methodology pivoting towards rearing and releasing large numbers of genetically modified, sterilized, or Wolbachia-mfecied male mosquitoes to control vector populations, economical surveillance methods for release tracking becomes increasingly necessary. Previous work has identified that male Ae. aegypti are attracted to female wingbeat frequencies and can be captured through artificial playback of these frequencies, but the tested systems are cost-prohibitive for wide-scale monitoring. Thus, we have developed a simple, low-cost, battery-powered, microcontroller-based sound lure which mimics the wingbeat frequency of female Ae. aegypti, thereby attracting males. We then tested the efficacy of this lure in combination with a passive (non-powered) gravid Aedes trap (GAT) against the current gold-standard, the Biogents Sentinel (BGS) trap, which requires main power (household power) and costs several times what the GAT does. Capture rates of male Ae. aegypti in sound-baited GATs (Sound-GATs) in these field tests were comparable to that of the BGS with no inhibitory effects of sound playback on female capture. We conclude that the Sound-GAT is an effective replacement of the costly BGS for surveillance of male Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, particularly in the developing countries where funding is limited, and has the potential to be adapted to target males of other medically important species.

AB Background: Exercise referral schemes within clinical populations may offer benefits for inactive and sedentary individuals, and improve and aid treatment of specific health disorders. This systematic review aims to provide an overview, and examine the impact, of exercise referral schemes in patients with cardiovascular, mental health, and musculoskeletal disorders. This review focuses on populations within the United Kingdom (UK) only, with an aim to inform national exercise referral policies and guidelines.
   Method: Data was collected from specific sources using validated methodology through PRISMA. Systematic searches were performed using Locate, PubMed, Scopus and Pro Quest: Public Health databases. Thirteen studies met inclusion criteria set for each sub group. This included that all studies aimed to prevent, observe, or decrease ill-health relating to the disorder, participants over the age of sixteen, and health disorders and outcomes were reviewed. All studies were conducted in the UK only.
   Results: In the 13 articles, a variety of modes and types of exercise were utilised. One-to-one supervised exercise sessions based in a gym environment were most frequently employed. Results showed that longer length schemes (20+ weeks) produced better health outcomes, and had higher adherence to physical activity prescribed, than those of shorter length (8-12 weeks). In patients referred with cardiovascular disorders, cardiovascular-related measures showed significant decreases including blood pressure. Schemes increased physical activity levels over the length of scheme for all disorders.
   Conclusion: Longer length schemes (20+ weeks) improved adherence to physical activity prescribed over the course of the scheme, and could support longer term exercise adherence upon completion, however additional research on larger samples should examine this further. An implication is that schemes currently recommended in guidelines do not tailor programmes to support long term adherence to exercise, which must be addressed. There is currently a lack of research examining programmes tailored to suit the individual's health conditions thus further research might allow providers to tailor delivery and build upon policy recommendations in the UK.

AB Background
   The Australian National Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (NBCSP) was introduced in 2006. When fully implemented, the programme will invite people aged 50 to 74 to complete an immunochemical faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) every 2 years.
   Methods and findings
   To investigate colorectal cancer (CRC) screening occurring outside of the NBCSP, we classified participants (n = 2,480) in the Australasian Colorectal Cancer Family Registry (ACCFR) into 3 risk categories (average, moderately increased, and potentially high) based on CRC family history and assessed their screening practices according to national guidelines. We developed a microsimulation to compare hypothetical screening scenarios (70% and 100% uptake) to current participation levels (baseline) and evaluated clinical outcomes and cost for each risk category. The 2 main limitations of this study are as follows: first, the fact that our cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from a third-party payer perspective, which does not include indirect costs and results in overestimated cost-effectiveness ratios, and second, that our natural history model of CRC does not include polyp sojourn time, which determines the rate of cancerous transformation.
   Screening uptake was low across all family history risk categories (64% +/- 56% reported no screening). For participants at average risk, 18% reported overscreening, while 37% of those in the highest risk categories screened according to guidelines. Higher screening levels would substantially reduce CRC mortality across all risk categories (95 to 305 fewer deaths per 100,000 persons in the 70% scenario versus baseline). For those at average risk, a fully implemented NBCSP represented the most cost-effective approach to prevent CRC deaths (AUS$ 13,000 +/- 16,000 per quality-adjusted life year [QALY]). For those at moderately increased risk, higher adherence to recommended screening was also highly costeffective (AUS$ 19,000 +/- 24,000 per QALY).
   Conclusion
   Investing in public health strategies to increase adherence to appropriate CRC screening will save lives and deliver high value for money.

TI Spatiotemporal prediction of infectious diseases using structured
   Gaussian processes with application to Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID APPROXIMATION; INFERENCE
AB Background
   Infectious diseases are one of the primary healthcare problems worldwide, leading to millions of deaths annually. To develop effective control and prevention strategies, we need reliable computational tools to understand disease dynamics and to predict future cases. These computational tools can be used by policy makers to make more informed decisions.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   In this study, we developed a computational framework based on Gaussian processes to perform spatiotemporal prediction of infectious diseases and exploited the special structure of similarity matrices in our formulation to obtain a very efficient implementation. We then tested our framework on the problem of modeling Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever cases between years 2004 and 2015 in Turkey.
   Conclusions/Significance
   We showed that our Gaussian process formulation obtained better results than two frequently used standard machine learning algorithms (i.e., random forests and boosted regression trees) under temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal prediction scenarios. These results showed that our framework has the potential to make an important contribution to public health policy makers.

AB Background
   Pathophysiological mechanisms are still incompletely understood for leprosy, an urgent public health issue in Brazil. Complement receptor 1 (CR1) binds complement fragments C3b/C4b deposited on mycobacteria, mediating its entrance in macrophages. We investigated CR1 polymorphisms, gene expression and soluble CR1 levels in a case-control study with Brazilian leprosy patients, aiming to understand the role of this receptor in differential susceptibility to the disease.
   Methodology
   Nine polymorphisms were haplotyped by multiplex PCR-SSP in 213 leprosy patients (47% multibacillary) and 297 controls. mRNA levels were measured by qPCR and sCR1 by ELISA, in up to 80 samples.
   Principal findings
   Individuals with the most common recombinant haplotype harboring rs3849266*T in intron 21 and rs3737002*T in exon 26 (encoding p. 1408Met of the York Yk(a) + antigen), presented twice higher susceptibility to leprosy (OR = 2.43, p = 0.017). Paucibacillary patients with these variants presented lower sCR1 levels, thus reducing the anti-inflammatory response (p = 0.040 and p = 0.046, respectively). Furthermore, the most ancient haplotype increased susceptibility to the multibacillary clinical form (OR = 3.04, p = 0.01) and presented the intronic rs12034383*G allele, which was associated with higher gene expression (p = 0.043), probably increasing internalization of the parasite. Furthermore, there was an inverse correlation between the levels of sCR1 and mannose-binding lectin (initiator molecule of the lectin pathway of complement, recognized by CR1) (R = -0.52, p = 0.007).
   Conclusions
   The results lead us to suggest a regulatory role for CR1 polymorphisms on mRNA and sCR1 levels, with haplotype-specific effects increasing susceptibility to leprosy, probably by enhancing parasite phagocytosis and inflammation.

   VIRUS; STRAIN
AB Enterovirus 71 (EV71) causes hand, foot and mouth disease, a mild and self-limited illness that is sometimes associated with severe neurological complications. EV71 neurotropic determinants remain ill-defined to date. We previously identified a mutation in the VP1 capsid protein (L97R) that was acquired over the course of a disseminated infection in an immunocompromised host. The mutation was absent in the respiratory tract but was present in the gut (as a mixed population) and in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (as a dominant species). In this study, we demonstrated that this mutation does not alter the dependence of EV71 on the human scavenger receptor class B2 (SCARB2), while it enables the virus to bind to the heparan sulfate (HS) attachment receptor and modifies viral tropism in cell lines and in respiratory, intestinal and neural tissues. Variants with VP1(97L) or VP1(97R) were able to replicate to high levels in intestinal and neural tissues and, to a lesser extent, in respiratory tissues, but their preferred entry site (from the luminal or basal tissue side) differed in respiratory and intestinal tissues and correlated with HS expression levels. These data account for the viral populations sequenced from the patient's respiratory and intestinal samples and suggest that improved dissemination, resulting from an acquired ability to bind HS, rather than specific neurotropism determinants, enabled the virus to reach and infect the central nervous system. Finally, we showed that iota-carrageenan, a highly sulfated polysaccharide, efficiently blocks the replication of HS-dependent variants in cells and 2D neural cultures. Overall, the results of this study emphasize the importance of HS binding in EV71 pathogenesis and open new avenues for the development of antiviral molecules that may prevent this virus's dissemination.

TI Understanding preferences for HIV care and treatment in Zambia: Evidence
   from a discrete choice experiment among patients who have been lost to
   follow-up
SO PLOS MEDICINE

DT Article

AB Background
   In public health HIV treatment programs in Africa, long-term retention remains a challenge. A number of improvement strategies exist (e.g., bring services closer to home, reduce visit frequency, expand hours of clinic operation, improve provider attitude), but implementers lack data about which to prioritize when resource constraints preclude implementing all. We used a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to quantify preferences for a number of potential clinic improvements to enhance retention.
   Methods and findings
   We sought a random sample of HIV patients who were lost to follow-up (defined as > 90 days late for their last scheduled appointment) from treatment facilities in Lusaka Province, Zambia. Among those contacted, we asked patients to choose between 2 hypothetical clinics in which the following 5 attributes of those facilities were varied: waiting time at the clinic (1, 3, or 5 hours), distance from residence to clinic (5, 10, or 20 km), ART supply given at each refill (1, 3, or 5 months), hours of operation (morning only, morning and afternoon, or morning and Saturday), and staff attitude ("rude" or "nice"). We used mixed-effects logistic regression to estimate relative utility (i. e., preference) for each attribute level. We calculated how much additional waiting time or travel distance patients were willing to accept in order to obtain other desired features of care. Between December 9, 2015 and May 31, 2016, we offered the survey to 385 patients, and 280 participated (average age 35; 60% female). Patients exhibited a strong preference for nice as opposed to rude providers (relative utility of 2.66; 95% CI 1.9 +/- 3.42; p < 0.001). In a standard willingness to wait or willingness to travel analysis, patients were willing to wait 19 hours more or travel 45 km farther to see nice rather than rude providers. An alternative analysis, in which trade-offs were constrained to values actually posed to patients in the experiment, suggested that patients were willing to accept a facility located 10 km from home (as opposed to 5) that required 5 hours of waiting per visit (as opposed to 1 hour) and that dispensed 3 months of medications (instead of 5) in order to access nice (as opposed to rude) providers. This study was limited by the fact that attributes included in the experiment may not have captured additional important determinants of preference.
   Conclusions
   In this study, patients were willing to expend considerable time and effort as well as accept substantial inconvenience in order to access providers with a nice attitude. In addition to service delivery redesign (e.g., differentiated service delivery models), current improvement strategies should also prioritize improving provider attitude and promoting patient centeredness D an area of limited policy attention to date.

AB Background
   Clonorchiasis, caused by the liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis, remains a serious public health issue in Asia, especially in China, and its relationship with cholangiocarcinoma has highlighted the importance of C. sinensis infection. Proteins containing tandem repeats (TRs) are found in a variety of parasites and, as targets of B-cell responses, are valuable for the serodiagnosis of parasite infections. Here, we identified a novel C. sinensis-specific antigen, Cs1, containing TRs, and investigated its diagnostic value, other immunological properties, and tissue distribution.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   A partial Cs1 cDNA sequence was cloned by screening an adult C. sinensis cDNA expression library. The full-length Cs1 cDNA was obtained by 50 rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The deduced Cs1 protein consists of a signal peptide and five TRs of 21 amino acids. The recombinant Cs1 (rCs1) was constructed and purified. rCs1 showed higher sensitivity (94.3%) and specificity (94.4%) than the C. sinensis excretory-secretory products (ESPs) according to ELISA of 114 serum samples. Native Cs1 was identified in C. sinensis ESPs and crude antigens of adult C. sinensis by western blotting using an anti-rCs1 monoclonal antibody. ELISA of recombinant peptides of different Cs1 regions demonstrated that the TR region was immunodominant in Cs1. Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy revealed that Cs1 is located in a granule-like structure surrounding the acetabulum of C. sinensis adults that has not previously been described.
   Conclusions/Significance
   We identified a novel C. sinensis-specific TR protein, Cs1, which is an antigen of high serological significance, compared with C. sinensis ESPs. The deduced features of Cs1 show a unique structure containing TRs and a signal peptide and the TR region is immunodominant in Cs1. This provides a basis for targeted screens of other antigens. The novel structure in which Cs1 is located also deserves further investigation.

ID TRYPANOSOMA-BRUCEI-GAMBIENSE; COTE-DIVOIRE; IVORY-COAST; IMPACT
AB Burkina Faso belongs to a group of countries in which human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, is no longer considered to be a public health problem. Although no native cases have been detected since 1993, there is still the risk of HAT re-emergence due to significant population movements between Burkina Faso and active HAT foci in Cote d'Ivoire. Since 2014, Burkina Faso receives support from the WHO to implement a passive surveillance program. This resulted in the detection in 2015 of the first putative native HAT case since two decades. However, epidemiological entomological and molecular biology investigations have not been able to identify with certainty the origin of this infection or to confirm that it was due to T. b. gambiense. This case emphasises the need to strengthen passive surveillance of the disease for sustained elimination of HAT as a public health problem in Burkina Faso.

AB Neglected tropical diseases caused by metazoan parasites are major public health concerns, and therefore, new methods for their control and elimination are needed. Research over the last 25 years has revealed the vital contribution of cysteine proteases to invasion of and migration by (larval) helminth parasites through host tissues, in addition to their roles in embryogenesis, molting, egg hatching, and yolk degradation. Their central function to maintaining parasite survival in the host has made them prime intervention targets for novel drugs and vaccines. This review focuses on those helminth cysteine proteases that have been functionally characterized during the varied early stages of development in the human host and embryogenesis.

ID BURDEN
AB Need for study
   Rabies is a neglected zoonotic disease. Given the low incidence, apart from the existing reporting syst, there is a need to look for other means of case detection strategies for rabies. Contact tracing is one such method to efficiently capture information.
   Objectives
   To find out the rabid status of biting animal through contact tracing and to determine health seeking behavior of the bite victims.
   Materials and methods
   An exploratory study using contact tracing was conducted during the first quarter of 2017 in villages coming under three Public Health Centers. The households of the bite victims were visited and details of rabies exposure obtained from the bite victim/adult responsible respondent using a standardized questionnaire.
   Results
   A total of 69 dog/cat bite cases were identified. 69.5% of bites were by stray dogs. 97.1% bite victims had Category III bites. Only 4.5% bite victims had taken PEP. 70.1% of animal bite cases were administered ARV. Only 7.2% bite victims had exposure to probable rabid animals. All dog bite victims were alive after 3 months of follow up.
   Conclusion
   Contact tracing was successful in case detection of probable rabid animal exposures and suitable for a period of one year.

AB Background
   In India, dengue disease is emerging as the most important vector borne public health problem due to rapid and unplanned urbanization, high human density and week management of the disease. Clinical cases are grossly underreported and not much information is available on prevalence and incidence of the disease.
   Methodology
   A cross sectional, stratified, facility based, multistage cluster sampling was conducted between May 4 and June 27, 2017 in Pune city. A total of 1,434 participants were enrolled. The serum samples were tested for detection of historical dengue IgG antibodies by ELISA using the commercial Panbio Dengue IgG Indirect ELISA kit. Anti-dengue IgG-capture Panbio ELISA was used for detection of high titered antibodies to detect recent secondary infection. We used this data to estimate key transmission parameters like force of infection and basic reproductive number. A subset of 120 indirect ELISA positive samples was also tested for Plaque Reduction Neutralizing Antibodies for determining serotype-specific prevalence.
   Findings
   Overall, 81% participants were infected with dengue virus (DENV) at least once if not more. The positivity was significantly different in different age groups. All the adults above 70 years were positive for DENV antibodies. Over 69% participants were positive for neutralizing antibodies against all 4 serotypes suggesting intense transmission of all DENV serotypes in Pune. Age-specific seroprevalence was consistent with long-term, endemic circulation of DENV. There was an increasing trend with age, from 21.6% among < 36 months to 59.4% in age group 10-12 years. We estimate that 8.68% of the susceptible population gets infected by DENV each year resulting into more than 3,00,000 infections and about 47,000 to 59,000 cases per year. This transmission intensity is similar to that reported from other known hyper-endemic settings in Southeast Asia and the Americas but significantly lower than report from Chennai.
   Conclusions
   Our study suggests that Pune city has high disease burden, all 4 serotypes are circulating, significant spatial heterogeneity in seroprevalence and suboptimal immunity in younger age groups. This would allow informed decisions to be made on management of dengue and introduction of upcoming dengue vaccines in the city.

AB International sustainable development goals for the elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health problem by 2030 highlight the pressing need to optimize strategies for prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Selected or transmitted resistance associated mutations (RAMs) and vaccine escape mutations (VEMs) in hepatitis B virus (HBV) may reduce the success of existing treatment and prevention strategies. These issues are particularly pertinent for many settings in Africa where there is high HBV prevalence and co-endemic HIV infection, but lack of robust epidemiological data and limited education, diagnostics and clinical care. The prevalence, distribution and impact of RAMs and VEMs in these populations are neglected in the current literature. We therefore set out to assimilate data for sub-Saharan Africa through a systematic literature review and analysis of published sequence data, and present these in an on-line database (https://livedataoxford.shinyapps.io/1510659619-3Xkoe2NKkKJ7Drg/). The majority of the data were from HIV/HBV coinfected cohorts. The commonest RAM was rtM204I/V, either alone or in combination with associated mutations, and identified in both reportedly treatment-naive and treatment-experienced adults. We also identified the suite of mutations rtM204V/I + rtL180M + rtV173L, that has been associated with vaccine escape, in over 1/3 of cohorts. Although tenofovir has a high genetic barrier to resistance, it is of concern that emerging data suggest polymorphisms that may be associated with resistance, although the precise clinical impact of these is unknown. Overall, there is an urgent need for improved diagnostic screening, enhanced laboratory assessment of HBV before and during therapy, and sustained roll out of tenofovir in preference to lamivudine alone. Further data are needed in order to inform population and individual approaches to HBV diagnosis, monitoring and therapy in these highly vulnerable settings.

TI Estimating dengue under-reporting in Puerto Rico using a multiplier

ID UNITED-STATES; ECONOMIC COST; SURVEILLANCE; EPIDEMIC; ILLNESS; VIRUS
AB Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral illness that causes a variety of health outcomes, from a mild acute febrile illness to potentially fatal severe dengue. Between 2005 and 2010, the annual number of suspected dengue cases reported to the Passive Dengue Surveillance System (PDSS) in Puerto Rico ranged from 2,346 in 2006 to 22,496 in 2010. Like other passive surveillance systems, PDSS is subject to under-reporting. To estimate the degree of under-reporting in Puerto Rico, we built separate inpatient and outpatient probability-based multiplier models, using data from two different surveillance systems-PDSS and the enhanced dengue surveillance system (EDSS). We adjusted reported cases to account for sensitivity of diagnostic tests, specimens with indeterminate results, and differences between PDSS and EDSS in numbers of reported dengue cases. In addition, for outpatients, we adjusted for the fact that less than 100% of medical providers submit diagnostic specimens from suspected cases. We estimated that a multiplication factor of between 5 (for 2010 data) to 9 (for 2006 data) must be used to correct for the under-reporting of the number of laboratory-positive dengue inpatients. Multiplication factors of between 21 (for 2010 data) to 115 (for 2008 data) must be used to correct for the under-reporting of laboratory-positive dengue outpatients. We also estimated that, after correcting for underreporting, the mean annual rate, for 2005-2010, of medically attended dengue in Puerto Rico to be between 2.1 (for dengue inpatients) to 7.8 (for dengue outpatients) per 1,000 population. These estimated rates compare to the reported rates of 0.4 (dengue outpatients) to 0.1 (dengue inpatients) per 1,000 population. The multipliers, while subject to limitations, will help public health officials correct for underreporting of dengue cases, and thus better evaluate the cost-and-benefits of possible interventions.

AB Background
   Symptom burden, medical comorbidities. and functional well-being of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) initiating direct acting antiviral (DAA) therapy in real-world clinical settings are not known. We characterized these patient-reported outcomes (PROs) among HCV-infected patients and explored associations with sociodemographic, liver disease, and psychiatric/substance abuse variables.
   Methods and findings
   PROP UP is a large US multicenter observational study that enrolled 1,600 patients with chronic HCV in 2016-2017. Data collected prior to initiating DAA therapy assessed the following PROs: number of medical comorbidities; neuropsychiatric, somatic, gastrointestinal symptoms (PROMIS surveys); overall symptom burden (Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale); and functional well-being (HCV-PRO). Candidate predictors included liver disease markers and patient-reported sociodemographic, psychiatric, and alcohol/drug use features. Predictive models were explored using a random selection of 700 participants; models were then validated with data from the remaining 900 participants. The cohort was 55% male. 39% non-white, 48% had cirrhosis (12% with advanced cirrhosis); 52% were disabled or unemployed; 63% were on public health insurance or uninsured; and over 40% had markers of psychiatric illness. The median number of medical comorbidities was 4 (range: 0-15), with sleep disorders, chronic pain, diabetes, joint pain and muscle aches being present in 20-50%. Fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain and neuropsychiatric symptoms were present in over 60% and gastrointestinal symptoms in 40-50%. In multivariable validation models, the strongest and most frequent predictors of worse PROs were disability, unemployment, and use of psychiatric medications, while liver markers generally were not.
   Conclusions
   This large multi-center cohort study provides a comprehensive and contemporary assessment of the symptom burden and comorbid medical conditions in patients with HCV treated in real world settings. Pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance were common and often severe. Sociodemographic and psychiatric markers were the most robust predictors of PROs. Future research that includes a rapidly changing population of HCV-infected individuals needs to evaluate how DAA therapy affects PROs and elucidate which symptoms resolve with viral eradication.

TI Confirmation of cholera by rapid diagnostic test amongst patients
   admitted to the cholera treatment centre in Uvira, Democratic Republic
   of the Congo
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID OUTBREAKS
AB Introduction
   Cholera is endemic in the Eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 1978, and Uvira in South-Kivu has been reporting suspected cholera cases nearly every week for over a decade. The clinical case definition for suspected cholera is relatively non-specific, and cases are rarely confirmed by laboratory methods, especially in endemic settings. This may lead to over-estimation of cholera cases and limit effective public health responses.
   Methods and results
   Between April 2016 and November 2017, 69% of the 2,059 patients admitted to the Uvira Cholera Treatment Centre (CTC) were tested for cholera with rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Of those admitted as suspected cholera cases, only 40% tested positive for cholera, equivalent to an estimated annual incidence of suspected/confirmed cholera in Uvira of 43.8 and 16.3 cases per 10,000 inhabitants respectively. A multivariable logistic regression indicates that boys aged 2 to 4 years, girls aged 5 to 15 years and adult men are respectively 1.9, 2.1 and 1.8 times more likely to test positive than adult women. On the contrary, boys under 2 are 10 times less likely to test positive. The odds of testing positive also increase as weekly admissions to the CTC rise, with up to a 5-fold increase observed during the weeks with the highest numbers of admissions compared to the lowest ones. Other predictors of cholera confirmation include duration of stay at the CTC, clinical outcome of admission, lower weekly rainfall and area of residence in Uvira, with the northern part of town having the highest confirmation rate.
   Conclusion
   Cholera is an on-going public health problem in Uvira but the majority of suspected cases admitted to the CTC were found to be negative for cholera after RDT testing. These findings may have important implications for cholera control strategies in favour of interventions that address cholera and other diarrhoeal diseases alike.

TI Risk factors for extremely serious road accidents: Results from national
   Road Accident Statistical Annual Report of China
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS; PROFESSIONAL DRIVERS; SEVERITY; VIOLATIONS; CRASHES;
   WEATHER; SINGLE
AB Background
   In the past decades, extremely serious road accidents with a death toll over ten in each have become a severe public health problem in China. This study investigates risk factors contributing to extremely serious road accidents, which will be crucial for accident prevention.
   Methods
   Collecting data from The Road Accident Statistical Annual Report openly issued by China's Traffic Management Bureau of the Public Security Ministry for the time period 2004-2015, we used the monthly case number of extreme serious road accidents as the dependent variable. We then selected ten risk factors as primary independent variables: professional driver, driving under influence (alcohol or drug), fatigue, vehicle type, overload, brake problem, weather, road classification, terrain, and region. The method of negative binominal regression was implemented to investigate the association between these risk factors and extremely serious road accidents.
   Results
   A total of 346 extremely serious road accidents were included in our analysis. On a national scale, we found that professional driver [incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.10, 95% CI: 1.02-1.19], fatigue (IRR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.03-1.29), large vehicle type (IRR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.03-1.21), overload (IRR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.03-1.16), and terrain (IRR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.01-1.18) were significantly associated with extremely serious road accidents. Besides, separate analyses on western and non-western region indicated that both regions had shared risk factors as well as distinct factors.
   Conclusions
   Our study identifies professional driver, fatigue, large vehicle type, overload, and terrain as significant risk factors of extremely serious road accidents in China, and targeted and preventative measures could be taken based on our findings.

TI Geographic differences in the prevalence of hypertension in Uganda:
   Results of a national epidemiological study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; GLOBAL BURDEN; RISK-FACTORS;
   POPULATION; MANAGEMENT
AB Background
   Hypertension accounts for more than 212 million global disability-adjusted life-years, and more than 15 million in sub-Saharan Africa. Identifying factors underlying the escalating burden of hypertension in sub-Saharan Africa may inform delivery of targeted public health interventions.
   Methods
   As part of the cross-sectional nationally representative Uganda National Asthma Survey conducted in 2016, we measured blood pressure (BP) in the general population across five regions of Uganda. We defined hypertension as systolic BP >= 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP >= 90 mmHg, or on-going use of medications for the purpose of lowering BP among adults (>= 18 years of age); pre-hypertension as systolic BP between 120 and 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP bteween 80 and 90 mmHg among adolescents and adults (>= 12 years of age).
   Findings
   Of 3416 participants who met inclusion criteria, 38.9% were male, and mean age +/- SD was 33.8 +/- 16.9 years. The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of hypertension was 31.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 30.2 to 32.8). The adjusted prevalence of hypertension was highest in the Central Region (34.3%; 95% CI 32.6 to 36.0), and it was comparable to that in the West and East Regions. However, compared with the Central Region, hypertension was significantly less prevalent in the North (22.0%; 95 CI 19.4 to 24.6) and West Nile Regions (24.1%; 95% CI 22.0 to 26.3). Adjustment for demographic characteristics (occupation, monthly income, and educational attainment) of participants did not account for the significantly lower prevalence of hypertension in the North and West Nile Regions. The prevalence of pre-hypertension was 38.8% (95% CI 37.7 to 39.8), and it was highly prevalent among young adults (21-40 years of age: 42.8%; 95% CI 41.2-44.5%) in all regions.
   Conclusions
   Hypertension is starkly prevalent in Uganda, and numerous more people, including young adults are at increased risk. The burden of hypertension is highest in the Central, Western, and Eastern regions of the country; demographic characteristics did not fully account for the disparate regional burden of hypertension. Future studies should explore the potential additional impact of epidemiological shifts, including diet and lifestyle changes, on the development of hypertension.

TI Antibiotic resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoea and treatment outcomes of
   gonococcal urethritis suspected patients in two large hospitals in
   Bhutan, 2015
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE; TREATMENT FAILURE
AB Introduction
   Gonorrhea is a major sexually transmitted infection (STI) globally with increasing trends. Despite limited data, gonorrhea remains an important public health problem in Bhutan.
   Methods
   A descriptive study was carried out in two Bhutanese hospitals; Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital and Phuentsholing General Hospital in 2015. Patients suspected of gonococcal urethritis were sampled, treated and followed up at two weeks. Gonococcal isolates were identified and tested for antibiotic susceptibility by the Calibrated Dichotomous Sensitivity Test (CDS) method.
   Results
   Of the 524 patients, 2.3% (12) were females. Most (46.6%) patients belonged to the 26-35 years age group. About 58% were lost to follow up; 62% (277) of males and all (12) females. N. gonorrhoea was positive in 76% (398) of microscopy and 73.1% (383) by culture. Resistance against ciprofloxacin, penicillin, tetracycline and nalidixic acid were 85.1%, 99.2%, 84.8% and 99.7% respectively. Nearly all the isolates were sensitive to cefpodoxime, ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Sixty-seven percent (350) were treated with injection ceftriaxone alone, 32% (169) with ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline and 1% (5) with ceftriaxone, doxycycline and metronidazole. Probable treatment failure was seen only in one patient (0.5%).
   Conclusions
   Gonococcal resistance to currently used antibiotics was low and there was a high clinical cure rate. Compliance to treatment guidelines need reinforcement addressing antibiotic regimen, tracing sexual partners and addressing the social stigma. National STI programs should be more women-friendly for effective management, prevention and control of STIs. Laboratories must adopt more reliable susceptibility testing methods, the Minimum Inhibition Concentration method.

TI Determinants of cigarette smoking and smoking intensity among adult

SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH

   regression; Negative binomial; Ghana
ID TOBACCO USE; ADOLESCENTS; BEHAVIOR; PATTERNS
AB Background: In spite of the adverse health and financial implications of smoking, it still remains one of the leading causes of preventable diseases and deaths in the world. Key to discouraging the habit of smoking is knowledge of the drivers of smoking. In Ghana, though smoking behaviours are relatively more associated with adult males than youth and adolescents, studies on smoking behaviours of adult males are scant. This study, therefore, investigates the determinants of cigarette smoking and smoking intensity among adult males in Ghana.
   Methods: Data were obtained from the most recent Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) conducted in 2014. Based on the 2014 GDHS, a negative binomial-logit hurdle model was estimated to explore the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics associated with cigarette consumption and smoking intensity among adult males in Ghana. To ensure robustness, separate estimations were performed for the respective logit and negative binomial models used in the two-part model.
   Results: We find that men in lower socioeconomic category (poor and low education) have a higher likelihood to smoke. Also, age proved significant in explaining smoking behaviors in Ghana. Moreover, religion and region of residence are reported to affect cigarette consumption decision. Furthermore, we find that among the men who smoke, those between the ages of 44 and 60 years and have attained approximately primary education have a higher likelihood to smoke greater quantities of cigarette daily. Also, the smokers who reside in the Upper East and Upper West regions are reported to smoke more intensely than their counterparts in the Greater Accra region.
   Conclusion: Since smoking remains one of the major causes of diseases and deaths the world over, the current study provides recent empirical evidence based on a nationally representative sample for public health policies geared towards smoking reduction and ultimately cessation. This study suggests that public policies that promote higher educational attainment and improved incomes (wealth) are crucial in smoking reduction and cessation in Ghana.

ID DIET QUALITY; OBESITY; URBAN; HYPERTENSION; DEPRESSION; RESISTANCE; RISK
AB Objective
   To assess the association between indicators of psychosocial stress and central adiposity in adult users of the Unified Health System (SUS) from Southeast of Brazil.
   Methods
   This cross-sectional study was conducted with 384 adults (20 to 59 years old) from the city of Alegre, Southeastern Brazil. The simple random sample represented the population using the public health system of the municipality. The prevalence of obesity was based on the Body Mass Index, and central adiposity (dependent variable) was measured by waist circumference in centimeters. The independent variables were the following indicators of psychosocial stress: food and nutrition insecurity (yes/no), serum cortisol (mu g/dL), symptoms suggestive of depression using the Beck Depression Inventory-II > 17 (yes/no), and altered blood pressure > 130/85 mmHg (yes/no). Univariate linear regression was performed between central adiposity and each stress indicator, and later the models were adjusted for socioeconomic, health, and lifestyle variables. All analyses were made separately by rural and urban location.
   Results
   The prevalence of weight excess, by the classification of the Body Mass Index > 25.0 kg/ m2, was 68.3% and, by waist circumference, 71.5% of individuals presented an increased risk for metabolic complications related to central adiposity. Mean waist circumference scores for the rural and urban population were 89.3 +/- 12.7 cm and 92.9 +/- 14.7 cm, respectively (p = 0.012). Indicators of stress that were associated with central adiposity were: cortisol in the rural population (beta = -0.60; 95% CI = -1.09;-0.11) and altered blood pres- Competing interests: The authors have declared sure in the urban population (beta = 6.66; 95% CI = 2.14;11.18). This occurred both in the raw analysis and in the models adjusted for confounding factors.
   Conclusion
   Central adiposity was inversely associated with cortisol in the rural population and directly associated with higher arterial blood pressure in the urban population, suggesting a local influence on how individuals react to stress.

AB The distribution, abundance and seasonal activity of vector species, such as ticks and mosquitoes, are key determinants of vector-borne disease risk, and are strongly influenced by abiotic and habitat conditions. Despite the numerous species of tick vectors in the heavily populated North American West Coast, all but Ixodes pacificus, the primary vector of the Lyme disease spirochete, is poorly characterized with regard to seasonal activity patterns and fine scale drivers of distribution and abundance, particularly in heavily populated regions of southern California. This lack of knowledge inhibits both scientific understanding and public health efforts to minimize vector exposure and risk of pathogen transmission to humans. Here we address this gap by characterizing the abiotic and habitat drivers of the distribution, abundance, and diversity of the vector tick community using fine scale temporal surveys over two seasons (2014 and 2015) across coastal and inland regions of Santa Barbara County, CA. We also characterize patterns of seasonal activity of the more common vector species to understand seasonality in risk of vector exposure, and specifically focus on human encounter risk using standardized tick drags as our method of collection. Leveraging plot-level habitat and abiotic variables in partial least squares regression analysis, we find the seven different vector species collected in this study have divergent drivers of activity and abundance. For example, I. pacificus is strongly associated with dense forest habitats and cool and moist microclimates, while Dermacentor occidentalis and Dermacentor variabilis, competent vectors of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, were found to be more tolerant of higher average temperatures and more open habitats. These results suggest that I. pacificus may be expected to experience reductions in geographic distribution and seasonal activity under projected land cover and climate change in coastal southern California, while D. occidentalis may experience more limited effects. We discuss implications for changing tick-borne disease risk associated with pathogens transmitted by Ixodes as well as Dermacentor species ticks in the western US, and contrast these predictions with eastern North America.

AB Background: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is a serious metabolic disease that is often associated with vascular complications. There are 1.9 million people living with Diabetes in Ethiopia; diabetes mellitus is found to be the ninth leading cause of death related to its complications. Although the rate of vascular complications continues to rise, there is limited information about the problem. This study aimed to estimate the incidence and predictors of vascular complications among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients at University of Gondar Referral Hospital.
   Methods: Institution based retrospective follow-up study was conducted at University of Gondar Referral Hospital with 341 newly diagnosed type 2 DM patients from September 2005 to March 2017 and the data were collected by reviewing their records. Schoenfeld residuals test and interaction of each covariate with time were used to check proportional hazard assumption. The best model was selected by using Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). Hazards ratio (HR) with its respective 95% confidence interval were reported to show strength of association.
   Result: The selected patients were followed retrospectively for a median follow up time of 8150 months (Inter quartile range (IQR) = 67.2-103.3). The mean age (+/- Standard deviation (SD) of patients at baseline was 51.7(SD: +/- 115 years) and 57.48% were females. The incidence rate of vascular complications was 40.6 cases/ 1000 person years of observation. The significant predictors for vascular complications where found to be male sex (Adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.27, 0.94), having hypertension at baseline(AHR = 3.99, 95% CI: 1.87, 8.56), positive protein urea at base line (AHR = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.03, 2.78), high density lipoprotein cholesterol(HDL-C) level >= 40 mg per deciliter (mg/dl) (AHR = 0.43, 95% CI: 024, 0.77), low density lipoprotein cholesterol(LDL-C) level > 100 mg/di (AHR = 3.05, 95% CI: 1.47, 6.35) and triglyceride > 150 mg/dl (AHR = 2.74, 95% CI: 1.28, 5.84).
   Conclusion: The incidence of vascular complications among type 2 diabetes patients remains a significant public health problem. Hypertension at baseline, LDL-C > 100 mg/dl, triglyceride > 150 mg/dl, HDL-C >= 40 mg/dl and male sex were significant predictors of vascular complication. In the light of these findings targeted interventions should be given to diabetes patients with hypertension comorbidity and dyslipidemia at follow up clinics.

AB Background: In Malawi, early retention in HIV care remains challenging. Depression is strongly associated with reduced anti-retroviral therapy (ART) adherence and viral suppression. Appropriate depression care for people initiating ART is likely to be supportive of early and continued engagement in the HIV care continuum. This paper aims to provide an overview of a task-shifting program that integrates depression screening and treatment into HIV care and the strategy used to evaluate this program, describes the implementation process, and discusses key challenges and lessons learned in the first phase of program implementation.
   Methods: We are implementing a program integrating depression screening and treatment into HIV care initiation at two clinics in Lilongwe District, Malawi. The program's effect on patients' depression and HIV outcomes will be evaluated using a multiple baseline pre-post study. In this manuscript, we draw from our experiences as program implementers and some of the quantitative data to describe the process of implementation and key lessons learned.
   Results: We successfully implemented the screening phase of this program at both clinics; 88.3 and 93.2% of newly diagnosed patients have been screened for depression at each clinic respectively. 25% of enrolled patients reported symptoms of mild-to-severe depression and only 6% reported symptoms of moderate-to-severe depression. Key lessons learned from the process show the importance of utilizing existing processes and infrastructure and focusing on iterative and collaborative learning. We continued to face challenges around establishing a sense of program ownership among providers, developing capacity to diagnose and manage depression, and ensuring the availability of appropriate medication. Our efforts to address these challenges provide insight into the technical and managerial support needed to prepare for, roll out, and sustain integrated models of mental health and HIV care.
   Conclusions: This activity demonstrates how a depression screening program can successfully be integrated into HIV care within the public health system in Malawi. While this program focuses on integrating depression management into HIV care, most of the lessons learned could apply to integration of mental health into any non-psychiatric specialist setting.

AB Background: Infectious diarrhea is a common problem in the developing world, especially among people living with HIV/AIDS. Traditional diagnostic methods such as stool culture and microscopic examination are limited by resources and poor sensitivity. The use of molecular diagnostics for enteropathogen detection in this region of sub-Saharan Africa has not been fully explored. We sought to identify risk factors and characterize enteropathogens from diarrheic stools of HIV-positive patients in Gondar, Ethiopia using multiplex molecular panels targeting key infectious agents.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study of 100 stool samples was performed. Samples were collected consecutively from HIV- positive patients presenting with diarrhea at University of Gondar Hospital clinic, a major center in NW Ethiopia. Genomic DNA was extracted from stool and processed using a multiplex molecular panel Allplex (TM) [Seegene, Canada]. Correlations between patient characteristics, symptoms, public health risk factors, and enteropathogen type (s) were studied. Eighty-six samples were successfully analyzed by molecular methods.
   Results: The mean age was 35 with 43% male. Eighty percent lived in an urban area, 18% had access to well water only, and 81% practiced proper hand hygiene. The majority of patients (72%) were receiving HAART with a median CD4 cell count of 362/mu L. Multiple pathogens were detected in 94% of specimens, with an average of 5 enteropathogens per sample. Common bacteria, viruses, and parasites detected were Shigella spplenteroinvasive E coli (80%), enterotoxigenic E. coli (73%), Norovirus (16%) and B. hominis (62%). CD4 cell count < 500/mu L was associated with the presence of viruses (p = 0.004) and the absence of STEC (p = 0.010). The use of HAART or CD4 levels was not associated with the number of enteropathogens detected.
   Conclusions: Diarrheic stool from HIV-positive outpatients in Gondar, Ethiopia had on average 5 enteropathogens present in their stool. Shigellaspp/enteroinvasive E. coli and enterotoxigenic E. coli are the major pathogens, not dissimilar to immunocompetent individuals in low income countries.

AB Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is not only the primary cause of death in developed western countries, but also its disease burden is increasing in China. The purpose of constructing population cardiovascular health index is to monitor, compare and evaluate disease burden, influencing factors and prevention and control levels of Chinese population cardiovascular disease in order to provide evidence to improve population cardiovascular health.
   Methods: This study collected multi-source data and constructed China Cardiovascular Health Index (CHI) using literature review, questionnaire surveys, Delphi method and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) model.
   Results: China CHI system included 52 indices of 5 dimensions, which were prevalence status of CVD, exposure of risk factors, prevention and control of risk factors, treatment situation and public health policy and service ability. The weights of 5 dimensions from high to low were successively prevention and control of risk factors 0.3656, prevalence status of CVD 0.2070, treatment situation 0.1812, public health policy and service ability 0.1458, and exposure of risk factors 0.1004.
   Conclusion: China CHI is a comprehensive evaluation system raised to effectively control the prevalence of CVD. In the future, we should strengthen and improve CVD monitoring and big data usage, to ensure these indices to reflect the practical situations and to become utility of controlling CVD.

AB Background: Two important helminths, Strongyloides stercoralis (an intestinal roundworm) and Opisthorchis viverrini (a liver fluke), are endemic in northeast Thailand. There have been national campaigns in place aimed at the control and eradication of soil-transmitted helminthiasis and opisthorchiasis in Thailand for several decades. However, these helminths still exist and raise concerns regarding public health. This study aimed to evaluate the current prevalence of S. stercoralis and O. viverrini infections in rural communities in northeast Thailand. The data from this study will be useful to improve strategies for future helminth prevention and control.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from December 2016 to June 2017 in Mueang Khon Kaen district in Khon Kaen, Thailand. The participants were selected using a simple random sampling method. Demographic data were collected using a questionnaire. Stool samples were collected and processed using agar plate culture to determine the presence of S. stercoralis infection and an in-house formalin-ethyl acetate concentration technique to determine the presence of O. viverrini and other intestinal parasite infections (IPIs).
   Results: In total, 602 persons were enrolled. However, only 526 were analyzed for S. stercoralis and 387 for O. viverrini risk factors. The overall prevalence of S. stercoralis infection was 23.0% (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 19.4 to 26.6). The prevalence of O. viverrini infection and IPIs other than S. stercoralis was 20.4% (95% CI: 16.5 to 24.8). The prevalence of O. viverrini infection was 19.4% (95% CI: 15.6 to 23.7). Male sex was significantly associated with S. stercoralis infection [Adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 4.0; 95% CI: 2.5 to 6.2; P-value < 0.001]. Males were significantly more likely to be infected with O. viverrini and other IPIs (aOR 4.1; 95% CI: 2.3 to 7.2, P-value < 0.001).
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated that the updated prevalence of intestinal parasite infections is still high in rural communities in northeast Thailand, especially that of strongyloidiasis and opisthorchiasis.

ID SELF-EXAMINATION
AB Background: Breast cancer accounted for 1.03% of all deaths in 2014 in Eritrea. Yet the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of the population in general or the health personnel in the country in relation to the disease, remains unknown. Hence, this study was designed to assess the KAP regarding breast cancer among female nurses working in ten hospital wards in Asmara, Eritrea.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted among 414 nurses. Descriptive statistics, t-test, and ANOVA were used to evaluate the KAP of the nurses.
   Results: Nurses' knowledge about the possible risk factors of breast cancer was low but the nurses knew the signs and symptoms of breast cancer since each sign or symptom was mentioned by >50% of them. The practice of breast cancer screening, however, was low (only 30 and 11.3% practiced clinical breast examination and mammography respectively). Respondents' family history of breast cancer, having breast problems, their professional level and unit where they worked were associated with the KAP of nurses about breast cancer.
   Conclusion: Training programs could help to increase the nurses' knowledge about the risk factors of breast cancer and practice of breast cancer screening. This could also help to increase the knowledge of the public about breast cancer.

AB Background: The transition from medical student to junior doctor is one of the most challenging in medicine, affecting both doctor and patient health. Opportunities to support this transition have arisen from advances in mobile technology and increased smartphone ownership.
   Methods: This qualitative study consisted of six in-depth interviews and two focus groups with Foundation Year 1 Trainees (intern doctors) and final year medical students within the same NHS Trust. A convenience sample of 14 participants was recruited using chain sampling. Interviews and focus groups were recorded, transcribed verbatim, analysed in accordance with thematic analysis and presented below in keeping with the standards for reporting qualitative research.
   Results: Participants represented both high and low intensity users. They used their smartphones to support their prescribing practices, especially antimicrobials through the MicroGuide (TM) app. Instant messaging, via WhatsApp, contributed to the existing bleep system, allowing coordination of both work and learning opportunities across place and time. Clinical photographs were recognised as being against regulations but there had still been occasions of use despite this. Concerns about public and colleague perceptions were important to both students and doctors, with participants describing various tactics employed to successfully integrate phone use into their practices.
   Conclusion: This study suggests that both final year medical students and foundation trainees use smartphones in everyday practice. Medical schools and healthcare institutions should seek to integrate such use into core curricula/ training to enable safe and effective use and further ease the transition to foundation training. We recommend juniors are reminded of the potential risks to patient confidentiality associated with smartphone use.

   STRAIN TYPES; TP0548 GENE; SYPHILIS; ASSOCIATION; MUTATION; LESIONS
AB Syphilis is an important public health problem and an increasing incidence has been noted in recent years. Characterization of strain diversity through molecular data plays a critical role in the epidemiological understanding of this re-emergence. We here propose a new high-resolution multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme for Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum (TPA). We analyzed 30 complete and draft TPA genomes obtained directly from clinical samples or from rabbit propagated strains to identify suitable typing loci and tested the new scheme on 120 clinical samples collected in Switzerland and France. Our analyses yielded three loci with high discriminatory power: TP0136, TP0548, and TP0705. Together with analysis of the 23S rRNA gene mutations for macrolide resistance, we propose these loci as MLST for TPA. Among clinical samples, 23 allelic profiles as well as a high percentage (80% samples) of macrolide resistance were revealed. The new MLST has higher discriminatory power compared to previous typing schemes, enabling distinction of TPA from other treponemal bacteria, distinction between the two main TPA clades (Nichols and SS14), and differentiation of strains within these clades.

AB The maintenance of behavioral change over the long term is essential to achieve public health goals such as combatting obesity and drug use. Previous work by our group has demonstrated a reliable shift in preferences for appetitive foods following a novel non-reinforced training paradigm. In the current studies, we tested whether distributing training trials over two consecutive days would affect preferences immediately after training as well as over time at a one-month follow-up. In four studies, three different designs and an additional pre-registered replication of one sample, we found that spacing of cue-approach training induced a shift in food choice preferences over one month. The spacing and massing schedule employed governed the long-term changes in choice behavior. Applying spacing strategies to training paradigms that target automatic processes could prove a useful tool for the long-term maintenance of health improvement goals with the development of real-world behavioral change paradigms that incorporate distributed practice principles.

   study
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article

   MANAGEMENT; THERAPY; IMPACT; CARE; NEEDS
AB Background
   Despite the increasing number of Crohn's disease patients self-administering nasogastric feeding as enteral nutrition support therapy, no studies have reported the experiences of self-administering nasogastric feeding from the perspective of these patients.
   Objectives
   To explore the initial trigger factors for the self-administration of nasogastric feeding by Crohn's disease patients and to understand the experiences of self-administration of nasogastric feeding, its effects on various aspects of life and work, and relevant challenges and coping mechanisms encountered during this therapy in order to improve the understanding of this group of patients among medical staff and the public.
   Design
   This study adopted a descriptive qualitative method. Crohn's disease patients from several tertiary hospitals in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, were recruited to participate through purposive sampling combined with maximum variation and the snowballing technique. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and analyzed using the conventional content analysis method.
   Results
   A total of 11 Crohn's disease patients were interviewed. Four themes and eight subthemes emerged from the analysis: rejecting the self-administration of nasogastric feeding (being afraid of inserting the nasogastric tube, having concerns about nasogastric feeding), accepting the reality of nasogastric feeding (health being the most important, followed by having sources of support), nasogastric feeding as a double-edged sword (the disturbances and efficacies of nasogastric feeding), and nasogastric feeding as a part of life (becoming accustomed to tube insertion and taking nasogastric feeding for granted).
   Conclusions
   Apart from suffering from physical discomfort, diet and body image disturbances, and inconveniences in daily life, Crohn's disease patients who self-administered nasogastric feeding faced many psychological challenges. Many of these patients eventually adjusted to a life with nasogastric feeding, but not everyone achieved this state. Therefore, health care providers, including physicians and nurses, and the general public should collaborate to help these patients adapt to their "new lives" as soon as possible.

AB Opioid addiction is a major public health issue worldwide. Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is used to detoxify users of illicit opiates, but drug relapse is common and associated with poor quality of life (QoL). This study investigated the associations between the GRIN3A, GRM6, and TPH2 genetic variants and QoL in the MMT population. A total of 319 participants were included in the study, and genotyping of GRIN3A, GRM6, and TPH2 genes was performed using the Sequenom iPLEX. Associations between genotypes and the domains of QoL were examined through posthoc analysis with LSMEANS syntax using SAS 9.1.3. The single nucleotide polymorphisms rs9325202 and rs1487275 in the TPH2 gene were significantly associated with the QoL domain of physical functioning. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression model revealed that the risk allele rs1487275-G was significantly correlated with the domain of physical functioning when clinical characteristics were considered as covariates. The results of the present study illuminate the importance of the genetic basis of QoL in the MMT population, and suggest that genotypes should be considered as a potential QoL indicator.

Since the World Health Organisation recommends Civil Society Organisation's (CSO) involvement to support compliance with smoke-free laws, we explored CSOs' perceptions of law implementation in Kampala, Uganda, and the challenges and opportunities for achieving compliance. Since hospitality workers tend to have the greatest level of exposure to second-hand smoke, we focussed on implementation in respect to hospitality venues (bars/pubs and restaurants).
   Methods: In August 2016, three months after law implementation, we invited key Kampala-based CSOs to participate in face-to-face semi-structured interviews. Interviews probed participants' perceptions about law implementation, barriers impeding compliance, opportunities to enhance compliance, and the role of CSOs in supporting law implementation. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Qualitative content analysis was conducted using the interview transcripts.
   Results: Fourteen individuals, comprising mainly senior managers from CSOs, participated and reported poor compliance with the smoke-free law in hospitality venues. Respondents noted that contributing factors included low awareness of the law amongst the general public and hospitality staff, limited implementation activities due to scarce resources and lack of coordinated enforcement. Opportunities for improving compliance included capacity building for enforcement agency staff, routine monitoring, rigorous enactment of penalties, and education about the smoke-free law aimed at hospitality venue staff and the general public. Allegations of tobacco industry misinformation were said to have undermined compliance. Civil Society Organisations saw their role as supporting law implementation through education, stakeholder engagement, and evidence-based advocacy.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that the process of smoke-free law implementation in Uganda has not aligned with World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines for implementing smoke-free laws, and highlights that low-income countries may need additional support to enable them to effectively plan for policy implementation and resist industry interference.

TI Built and natural environment planning principles for promoting health:
   an umbrella review
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Review
DE Umbrella review; Built and natural environment; Health; Planning
AB Background: The built and natural environment and health are inextricably linked. However, there is considerable debate surrounding the strength and quality of the evidence base underpinning principles of good practice for built and natural environment design in promoting health. This umbrella review aimed to assess relationships between the built and natural environment and health, concentrating on five topic areas: neighbourhood design, housing, food environment, natural and sustainable environment, and transport.
   Methods: A structured search was conducted for quantitative systematic reviews and stakeholder reviews published between January 2005 and April 2016. Seven databases and the websites of 15 relevant and respected stakeholder organisations known to publish review-level documentation were searched. Searches were limited to English-language publications and duplicate references were removed. Evidence quality and strength was appraised using validated techniques. Findings were used to develop a diagram for each topic area, illustrating relationships between built and natural environment planning principles and health-related outcomes.
   Results: A total of 117 systematic reviews and review-level documents were eligible for inclusion. The quality of evidence was mixed; much of the evidence examined relied on findings from cross-sectional studies, making it difficult to draw clear causal links between built environment exposures and health-related impacts and outcomes. Fourteen actionable planning principles associated with positive health-related outcomes were identified across the five topic areas. For example, neighbourhoods that enhanced walkability, were complete and compact in design, and those which enhanced connectivity through safe and efficient infrastructure were associated with better health-related outcomes relating to physical activity, social engagement, mental health, perceptions of crime, and road traffic collisions. Evidence for the effectiveness of planning principles across different topic areas and on reducing health inequalities was sparse and inconclusive.
   Conclusions: Findings provide an up-to-date overview of relationships between the built and natural environment and health and present logical, evidence-based messages to aid communication between public health and planning professionals.

AB Background: Delayed treatment of tuberculosis (TB) cases increases the risk of death and rate of infection in the community. Early diagnosis and initiation of treatment is essential for effective TB control. The aim of this study was to assess length of delays and analyze predictors of treatment delay of newly diagnosed TB patients.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Dessie city and surroundings from April 1, 2016 to January 30, 2017. Fifteen health facilities of study area were selected randomly and 382 adult TB patients were included consecutively. Data were collected using a questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS version 20.0. Delay was analyzed at three levels (patient, health system and total) using median as cut-off. Logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate predictors of delays. A p-value of <= 0.05 at multivariate analysis was considered statistically significant.
   Results: The median total, patients' and health system's delay was 36 [interquartile range (IQR): 24, 64], 30 (IQR: 15, 60) and 6 (IQR: 4, 8) days, respectively. About 41 and 47% of patients had prolonged patients and total delay, respectively. Practicing self-medication [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 3.0; 95% CI: 13-5.6], having more than three family member in the household (AOR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.02-2.50), older age (>= 55 years) (AOR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.27-5.83), being smear negative pulmonary tuberculosis (AOR: 23; 95% CI: 125-4.21) and extrapulmonary tuberculosis (AOR: 23; 95% CI: 1.28-4.07) were independent predictors of patients' delay. Initial visit of general practitioners (AOR: 257; 95% CI: 1.43-4.63) and more than one health care visit (AOR: 2.12; 95% CI: 1.30-3.46) were independent predictors of health system's delay. However, patients' delay was shorter among widowed/divorced patients (AOR: 0.3; 95% CI: 0.1-0.8). Lower level of education [illiterate (AOR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.20-0.92), grade 1-8 (AOR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.18-0.81)] and diagnosis of TB using a chest X-ray (AOR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.16-0.68) significantly reduce health system's delay.
   Conclusion: About half of TB patients delayed beyond 36 days before starting treatment, and the late patient health seeking behavior was the major contributor of total delay. Development and implementation of strategies aimed at addressing identified factors should be recognized in order to reduce TB treatment delay. Further well designed research is needed to explore additional risk factors of delayed treatment.

AB Background: No study has reported the epidemiology of AIDS-related opportunistic illnesses (AOIs) in patients with newly diagnosed HIV infection in Taiwan in the past decade. Understanding the current trends in AOI-related morbidity/mortality is essential in improving patient care and optimizing current public health strategies to further reduce AOIs in Taiwan in the era of contemporary highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
   Methods: Eligible patients were evaluated at two referral centers between 2010 and 2015. The patients were stratified by date of diagnosis into three periods: 2010-2011, 2012-2013, and 2014-2015. The demographics, HIV stage at presentation according to the United States CDC 2014 case definition, laboratory variables, and the occurrence of AOIs and associated outcomes were compared among the patients. Logistic regression and Cox regression were respectively used to identify variables associated with the occurrence of AOIs within 90 days of HIV enrollment and all-cause mortality.
   Results: Over a mean observation period of 469 days, 1264 patients with newly diagnosed HIV with a mean age of 29 years and mean CD4 count of 275 cells/mu L experienced 394 AOI episodes in 290 events. At presentation, 37.7% of the patients had AIDS; the frequency did not significantly differ across groups. The overall proportion of AOIs within the study period was 21.0%, and no decline across groups was observed. The majority of AOls (91.7%) developed within 90 days of enrollment. All-cause and AOI-related mortality did not significantly differ across groups. Throughout the three study periods, AOIs remained the main cause of death (47/56, 83.9%), especially within 180 days of enrollment (40/42, 95.2%). A CD4 cell count of < 200 cells/mu L at presentation was associated with increased adjusted odds of an AOI within 90 days [adjusted odds ratio, 40.84; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 12. 59-132.49] and an elevated adjusted hazard of all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 11.03; 95% CI, 1.51-80.64).
   Conclusions: Despite efforts toward HIV prevention and management, early HIV care in Taiwan continues to be critically affected by AOI-related morbidity and mortality in the era of contemporary HAART. Additional targeted interventions are required for the earlier diagnosis of patients with HIV.

AB Background: This is a facility-based study designed to assess perceived quality of care and satisfaction of reproductive health services under the output-based approach (OBA) services in Kenya from clients' perspective.
   Method: An exit interview was conducted on 254 clients in public health facilities, non-governmental organizations, faith-based organizations and private facilities in Kitui, Kilifi, Kiambu, and Kisumu counties as well as in the Korogocho and Viwandani slums in Nairobi, Kenya using a 23-item scale questionnaire on quality of reproductive health services. Descriptive analysis, exploratory factor analysis, reliability test, and subgroup analysis using linear regression were performed.
   Results: Clients generally had a positive view on staff conduct and healthcare delivery but were neutral on hospital physical facilities, resources, and access to healthcare services. There was a high overall level of satisfaction among the clients with quick service, good handling of complications, and clean hospital stated as some of the reasons that enhanced satisfaction. The County of residence was shown to impact the perception of quality greatly with other social demographic characteristics showing low impact.
   Conclusion: Majority of the women perceived the quality of OBA services to be high and were happy with the way healthcare providers were handling birth related complications. The conduct and practice of healthcare workers is an important determinant of client's perception of quality of reproductive and maternal health services. Findings can be used by health care managers as a guide to evaluate different areas of healthcare delivery and to improve resources and physical facilities that are crucial in elevating clients' level of satisfaction.

AB Background: Multimorbidity is recognized as a major public health issue that increases with age and affects approximately two-thirds of older people in Canada, the US, Australia and many European countries. This study develops and tests a three domain (functional, social and psychological) multimorbidity resilience composite index based on a previously developed lifecourse model of multimorbidity resilience, incorporating measures of adversity and positive adaptation. The criterion validity of the measure is demonstrated by means of an analysis of key outcome variables drawn from the literature.
   Methods: We used the baseline data from the Comprehensive Cohort of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging. Associations of functional, social, psychological as well as total resilience with two health utilization and three illness context outcome variables were examined using logistic regression analyses, adjusted for age, gender, marital status, income, education, region, and number of chronic conditions.
   Results: The sample included all 6771 Canadian adults aged 65 or older (mean age 73.0, 57% women) who reported two or more of 27 possible chronic conditions. Total resilience was associated with: perceived health (OR = 1.68, CI 1.59-1.77); sleep quality (OR = 1.34, CI 1.30-1.38); perceived pain (OR = 0.80, CI 0.77-0.83); hospital overnight stays (OR = 0.87, CI 0.83-0.91); and emergency department visits (OR = 0.90, CI 0.87-0.94)., after adjusting for socio-demographic factors, and number of chronic conditions. These associations were similar for the unadjusted models, as well as for the functional, social and psychological resilience sub-indices.
   Conclusions: Combining components of adversity and positive adaptation within functional, social and psychological domains produces a measure of multimorbidity resilience that is associated with more positive health outcomes. Several implications of a composite multimorbidity resilience measure for clinical practice are identified. This measure can be replicated using measures found in other secondary health data sets. Future validation using longitudinal data is warranted.

TI Association between internal migration and epidemic dynamics: an
   analysis of cause-specific mortality in Kenya and South Africa using
   health and demographic surveillance data

AB Background: Many low- and middle-income countries are facing a double burden of disease with persisting high levels of infectious disease, and an increasing prevalence of non-communicable disease (NCD). Within these settings, complex processes and transitions concerning health and population are underway, altering population dynamics and patterns of disease. Understanding the mechanisms through which changing socioeconomic and environmental contexts may influence health is central to developing appropriate public health policy. Migration, which involves a change in environment and health exposure, is one such mechanism.
   Methods: This study uses Competing Risk Models to examine the relationship between internal migration and premature mortality from AIDS/TB and NCDs. The analysis employs 9 to 14 years of longitudinal data from four Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems (HDSS) of the INDEPTH Network located in Kenya and South Africa (populations ranging from 71 to 223 thousand). The study tests whether the mortality of migrants converges to that of non-migrants over the period of observation, controlling for age, sex and education level.
   Results: In all four HDSS, AIDS/TB has a strong influence on overall deaths. However, in all sites the probability of premature death (45q15) due to AIDS/TB is declining in recent periods, having exceeded 0.39 in the South African sites and 0.18 in the Kenyan sites in earlier years. In general, the migration effect presents similar patterns in relation to both AIDS/TB and NCD mortality, and shows a migrant mortality disadvantage with no convergence between migrants and non-migrants over the period of observation. Return migrants to the Agincourt HDSS (South Africa) are on average four times more likely to die of AIDS/TB or NCDs than are non-migrants. In the Africa Health Research Institute (South Africa) female return migrants have approximately twice the risk of dying from AIDS/TB from the year 2004 onwards, while there is a divergence to higher AIDS/TB mortality risk amongst female migrants to the Nairobi HDSS from 2010.
   Conclusion: Results suggest that structural socioeconomic issues, rather than epidemic dynamics are likely to be associated with differences in mortality risk by migrant status. Interventions aimed at improving recent migrant's access to treatment may mitigate risk.

   BIOGENETIC EXPLANATIONS; BIPOLAR DISORDER; YOUNG-PEOPLE; EFFECTIVE
   INTERVENTIONS; EATING-DISORDERS; PUBLIC STIGMA; UNITED-STATES
AB Background: Stigma across HIV/AIDS, mental illness, and physical disability can be co-occurring and may interact with other forms of stigma related to social identities like race, gender, and sexuality. Stigma is especially problematic for people living with these conditions because it can create barriers to accessing necessary social and structural supports, which can intensify their experiences with stigma. This review aims to contribute to the knowledge on stigma by advancing a cross-analysis of HIV/AIDS, mental illness, and physical disability stigma, and exploring whether and how intersectionality frameworks have been used in the systematic reviews of stigma.
   Methods: A search of the literature was conducted to identify systematic reviews which investigated stigma for HIV/AIDS, mental illness and/or physical disability. The electronic databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, COCHRANE, and PsycINFO were searched for reviews published between 2005 and 2017. Data were extracted from eligible reviews on: type of systematic review and number of primary studies included in the review, study design study population(s), type(s) of stigma addressed, and destigmatizing interventions used. A keyword search was also done using the terms "intersectionality", "intersectional", and "intersection"; related definitions and descriptions were extracted. Matrices were used to compare the characteristics of reviews and their application of intersectional approaches across the three health conditions.
   Results: Ninety-eight reviews met the inclusion criteria. The majority (99%) of reviews examined only one of the health conditions. Just three reviews focused on physical disability. Most reviews (94%) reported a predominance of behavioural rather than structural interventions targeting stigma in the primary studies. Only 17% of reviews used the concept and/or approach of intersectionality; all but one of these reviews examined HIV/AIDS.
   Conclusions: The lack of systematic reviews comparing stigma across mental illness, HIV/AIDS, and physical disability indicates the need for more cross-comparative analyses among these conditions. The integration of intersectional approaches would deepen interrogations of co-occurring social identities and stigma.

AB Background: PM2.5 has become a major component of air pollution in China and has led to a series of health problems. The mortality rate caused by lung cancer has reached the point where it cannot be ignored in China. Air pollution is becoming more and more serious in China, which is increasingly affecting people's lives and health.
   Methods: Considering the variations in the geographical environment in China, this paper studied the relationship between PM2.5 concentration and lung cancer mortality based on the geographical weighted regression model in 31 provinces in 2004 and 2008, autonomous regions and municipalities of China.
   Results: The results indicated there was a significant positive correlation between PM2.5 concentration and lung cancer mortality (r= 0.0052, P= 0.036). Additionally, the longer the time of exposure to PM2.5 is, the higher morbidity is.
   Conclusion: It is suggested that the Chinese government should launch some environmental policy, especially in those areas with severe PM2.5 pollutions, and keep the citizens away from exposure to PM2.5 pollution in the long term.

TI Infection risks of city canal swimming events in the Netherlands in 2016
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID WATER-QUALITY INDICATORS; NOROVIRUS; OUTBREAK; ILLNESS; EXPOSURE;
   BEACHES
AB Introduction
   Swimming events in city canals are gaining popularity in the Netherlands, even though canal water is usually not officially designated for recreational use. Knowledge regarding the risk of infection after swimming in canals is limited. An outbreak was reported in 2015 following a canal swimming event in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Local governments were concerned about the health risks of such events. In order to assess the safety of canal swimming, the Public Health Service (PHS) prospectively investigated two city canal swimming events in 2015. In 2016, we repeated this study, aiming to prospectively determine the risks of infection during two urban swimming events, the Utrecht SingelSwim 2016 (USS) and the Amsterdam City Swim 2016 (ACS).
   Methods
   We sent online questionnaires to 271 USS participants and 2697 ACS participants, concerning personal characteristics, symptoms, and exposure. Participants were asked to forward the questionnaire to three relatives, i.e., non-exposed. We analyzed water samples from the USS venue taken during the event, as well as stool samples of USS participants with acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI). AGI was defined as diarrhea and/or vomiting within seven days after the event. We calculated adjusted risk ratios (RR) for AGI in the exposed group compared with non-exposed respondents, using binomial regression models.
   Results
   The questionnaire was returned by 160 USS participants (exposed) (59%) and 40 non-exposed relatives. Five percent of the exposed (n = 17) and 3% of non-exposed (n =1) reported AGI (RR = 1.69; 95% CI: 0.23-12.46). Norovirus genogroup II was detected in of six USS water samples and in none of the three stool samples. In one of three stool samples, rotavirus was detected.
   The questionnaire was returned by 1169 ACS participants (exposed) (43%) and 410 non-exposed relatives. Six percent of the exposed (n = 71) and 1% of non-exposed (n = 5) reported AGI (RR 4.86; 95% CI: 1.98-11.97).
   Conclusion
   Results of the ACS event showed a higher risk for AGI among the exposed, indicating that participants of events in urban canals in the Netherlands could be at a higher risk for AGI than those not participating. The inconclusive results from the USS are likely due to the small sample size. Swimming in non-monitored open water can bring health risks and more knowledge about environmental and human risk factors helps reduce the risk by being able to more specifically advise organizations and governments.

DT Review

AB Background
   Caesarean section rates are increasing worldwide and are a growing concern with limited explanation of the factors that influence the rising trend. Understanding obstetricians' and midwives' views can give insight to the problem. This systematic review aimed to offer insight and understanding, through aggregation, summary, synthesis and interpretation of findings from studies that report obstetricians' and midwives' views on the factors that influence the decision to perform caesarean section.
   Methods
   The electronic databases of PubMed (1958-2016), CINAHL (1988-2016), Maternity and Infant Care (1971-2016), PsycINFO (1980-2016) and Web of Science (1991-2016) were searched in September 2016. All quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods studies, published in English, whose aim was to explore obstetricians' and/or midwives' views of factors influencing decision-making for caesarean section were included. Papers were independently reviewed by two authors for selection by title, abstract and full text. Thomas et al's 12 assessment criteria checklist (2003) was used to assess methodological quality of the included studies.
   Result
   The review included 34 studies: 19 quantitative, 14 qualitative, and one using mixed methods, involving 7785 obstetricians and 1197 midwives from 20 countries. Three main themes, each with several subthemes, emerged. Theme 1: "clinicians' personal beliefs"-('Professional philosophies'; 'beliefs in relation to women's request for CS'; 'ambiguous versus clear clinical reasons'); Theme 2: "health care systems"-('litigation'; 'resources'; 'private versus public/insurance/payments'; 'guidelines and management policy'). Theme 3: "clinicians' characteristics" ('personal convenience'; 'clinicians' demographics'; 'confidence and skills').
   Conclusion
   This systematic review and metasynthesis identified clinicians' personal beliefs as a major factor that influenced the decision to perform caesarean section, further contributed by the influence of factors related to the health care system and clinicians' characteristics. Obstetricians and midwives are directly involved in the decision to perform a caesarean section, hence their perspectives are vital in understanding various factors that have influence on decision-making for caesarean section. These results can help clinicians identify and acknowledge their role as crucial members in the decision-making process for caesarean section within their organisation, and to develop intervention studies to reduce caesarean section rates in future.

AB Background: Since most cervical cancer cases are caused by persistent high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection, knowledge of HPV among women is essential for the prevent of cervical cancer. This study was aimed to assess knowledge among women in western China about HPV and its association with cervical cancer, and to assess their acceptance of HPV vaccination.
   Methods: A sample of healthy women undergoing routine physical examinations in the Health Management Center of West China Hospital, Sichuan University between January and December 2014 completed a questionnaire.
   Results: A total of 1300 questionnaires were distributed, and 1109 were completed and analyzed. Only 28.85% of respondents (n = 320) had heard of HPV; among this subgroup, only half (53.44%) knew that it causes cervical cancer, only 26 (8.13%) correctly answered all questions about HPV. Multivariate analysis showed that respondents who had heard of HPV were more likely than other respondents to have a family history of any cancer, to undergo regular Pap tests and to have completed at least secondary education. Half of all respondents (51.22%) reported that they would be willing to be vaccinated against HPV.
   Conclusion: Although most women in western China lack basic knowledge about HPV, at least half are willing to take the HPV vaccine. Public health efforts to educate the public about HPV and its connection to cervical cancer should be strengthened and expanded.

AB Background: Dengue viruses (DENV) have emerged and reemerged in Brazil in the past 30 years causing explosive epidemics. The disease may range from clinically asymptomatic infections to severe and fatal outcomes. We aimed to describe the epidemiological, clinical and laboratorial aspects of the dengue fatal cases received by a Regional Reference Laboratory, Brazil in 30 years.
   Methods: A total of 1047 suspected fatal dengue cases were received from 1986 to 2015 and analyzed in the Laboratory of Flavivirus, FIOCRUZ. Suspected cases were submitted to viral detection, serological and molecular methods for cases confirmation. Influence of gender, age, serotype and type of infection (primary/secondary) on death outcome, as well the interactions between serotype and age or infection and age and type of infection were also studied.
   Results: A total of 359 cases (34.2%) were confirmed and DENV-1 (11.1%), DENV-2 (43.9%), DENV-3 (32.8%) and DENV-4 (13.7%) were detected. Overall, fatal cases occurred more often in primary infections (59.3%, p = 0.001). However, in 2008, fatal cases were mainly associated to secondary infections (p = 0.003). In 2008 and 2011, deaths were more frequent on children and those infected by DENV-2 presented a higher risk for fatal outcome. Moreover, children with secondary infections had a 4-fold higher risk for death.
   Conclusions: Dengue is a multifactorial disease and, factors such as viral strain/serotype, occurrence of secondary infections and co-morbidities may lead to a severe outcome. However, the high dengue incidence and transmission during epidemics, such as those observed in Brazil may overwhelm and collapse the public health services, potentially impacting on increased disease severity and mortality.

AB Background: ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) is the first ranked among most common causes of death invoiving cardiovascular and other diseases. The information on the prevalence of IHD in Thailand is lacking especially among patients with diabetes mellitus. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of IHD among patients with diabetes mellitus and to determine factors associated with IHD in a nation-wide survey.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study to assess national outcomes among patients with diabetes who visited 831 public hospitals in Thailand was conducted in 2013 to evaluate status of care among patients with diabetes aged at least 18 years who received medical treatment in the target hospital for the last 12 months.
   Results: A total of 25,902 patients with diabetes were included in this study. IHD was detected among 918 patients (3.54%; 95%CI 3.32-3.77). Multivariate analysis was conducted to determine which factors were most associated with IHD, and the results showed age (AORs 1.05; 95%CI 1.04-1.05), being male (AORs 1.78; 95%CI 1.53-2.07), hypertensive comorbidity (AORs 2.10; 95%CI 1.68-2.62), being in Health Region 4 (AORs 1.93; 95%CI 1.54-2.35), presenting hyperglycemic crisis (AORs 1.53; 95%CI 1.14-2.06) and insulin therapy (AORs 1.40; 95%CI 1.17-1.66) were the highest associated factors for IHD in this population.
   Conclusion: Our data emphasized that IHD was a problem among patients with diabetes. Diabetic patients should be regularly assessed for IHD and their risk factors should be better controlled. Moreover, the Ministry of Public Health managers and clinicians should provide further preventative strategies to attenuate cardiovascular disease.

ID SETTINGS; CHILDREN; ADULTS
AB Background: Upper respiratory tract infections are the leading cause of misuse of antibiotics, a problem that leads to unnecessary adverse events and antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic prescription in Ecuador was analyzed in order to evaluate the state of antibiotic prescribing for upper respiratory tract infections. Both the appropriateness and adequacy of prescribing was evaluated. Appropriateness represents the percentage of prescriptions that are indicated; adequacy refers to the percentage of patients requiring antibiotics who are treated.
   Methods: The aim of the study is to analyze the appropriateness and adequacy of antibiotic prescription for upper respiratory tract infections in the Ambulatory Health Centers of the Ministry of Public Health of Ecuador. This is a cross-sectional study of patients from one Health Center of the Ministry of Public Health in the District 17D03 in Ecuador during 2015 with upper respiratory tract infection as a primary diagnosis.
   Results: We included a total of 1393 patients in the analysis. Out of the 1393 patients identified, 523 were prescribed antibiotics, constituting an antibiotic prescription rate of 37.5%, and 51 required antibiotics, reflecting a real need of antibiotics of 3.7%. Appropriateness: Of these 523 patients who were treated, 51 required an antibiotic, resulting in an appropriate antibiotic prescription rate of 9.75%. Adequacy: When analyzing each individual case, 33 of these 51 patients received an antibiotic, constituting an adequate prescription rate of 64.7%.
   Conclusions: The results of our study report a 90.25% of inappropriate prescription. The antibiotic prescription, appropriate prescription, and adequate prescription rates show the need for implementation of strategies in order to reduce them. Related aspects regarding prescriber's behavior and the patient's expectations should be analyzed.

TI Gender-specific associations between perceived and objective

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article

   WALKING; FEAR; PERCEPTIONS; HEALTH; RISK; POPULATION
AB Much research has considered the relationship between neighbourhood crime and physical activity, but few studies have assessed clinical outcomes consequent to behaviour, such as cardiometabolic risk. Fewer still have simultaneously assessed perceived and objective measures of crime. Perceptions of crime and actual victimisation vary according to gender; thus, this study sought to assess: 1) correspondence between perceived and objective neighbourhood crime; and 2) gender-specific associations between perceived and reported crime and metabolic syndrome, representing cardiometabolic risk. The indirect effect of neighbourhood crime on metabolic syndrome via walking was additionally evaluated. An Australian population-based biomedical cohort study (2004-2007) collected biomedical, socio-demographic, and neighbourhood perceptions data from n = 1,172 urban-dwelling, adults. Area-level reported crime rates were standardised and linked to individual data based on participants' residential location. Correspondence between actual and perceived crime measures was assessed using Pearson correlation coefficients. Cross-sectional associations between crime and metabolic syndrome were analysed using generalised estimating equations regression models accounting for socio-demographic factors and area-level income. Correspondence between perceived and objective crime was small to medium among men and women (r = 0.17 to 0.33). Among men, metabolic syndrome was related to rates of violent (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.08-1.35) and total crime (OR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.04-1.32), after accounting for perceived crime. Among women, metabolic syndrome was related to perceived crime (OR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.14-1.60) after accounting for total reported crime. Among women, there were indirect effects of perceived crime and property crime on metabolic syndrome through walking. Results indicate that crime, an adverse social exposure, is linked to clinical health status. Crime rates, and perceptions of crime and safety, differentially impact upon cardiometabolic health according to gender. Social policy and public health strategies targeting crime reduction, as well as strategies to increase perceptions of safety, have potential to contribute to improved cardiometabolic outcomes.

TI One million dog vaccinations recorded on mHealth innovation used to
   direct teams in numerous rabies control campaigns
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID RURAL AFRICA; ELIMINATION; HEALTH; IMPACT
AB Background
   Canine transmitted rabies kills an estimated 59,000 people annually, despite proven methods for elimination through mass dog vaccination. Challenges in directing and monitoring numerous remote vaccination teams across large geographic areas remain a significant barrier to the up-scaling of focal vaccination programmes to sub-national and national level. Smartphone technology (mHealth) is increasingly being used to enhance the coordination and efficiency of public health initiatives in developing countries, however examples of successful scaling beyond pilot implementation are rare. This study describes a smartphone app and website platform, "Mission Rabies App", used to co-ordinate rabies control activities at project sites in four continents to vaccinate over one million dogs.
   Methods
   Mission Rabies App made it possible to not only gather relevant campaign data from the field, but also to direct vaccination teams systematically in near real-time. The display of user-allocated boundaries on Google maps within data collection forms enabled a project manager to define each team's region of work, assess their output and assign subsequent areas to progressively vaccinate across a geographic area. This ability to monitor work and react to a rapidly changing situation has the potential to improve efficiency and coverage achieved, compared to regular project management structures, as well as enhancing capacity for data review and analysis from remote areas. The ability to plot the location of every vaccine administered facilitated engagement with stakeholders through transparent reporting, and has the potential to motivate politicians to support such activities.
   Results
   Since the system launched in September 2014, over 1.5 million data entries have been made to record dog vaccinations, rabies education classes and field surveys in 16 countries. Use of the system has increased year-on-year with adoption for mass dog vaccination campaigns at the India state level in Goa and national level in Haiti.
   Conclusions
   Innovative approaches to rapidly scale mass dog vaccination programmes in a sustained and systematic fashion are urgently needed to achieve the WHO, OIE and FAO goal to eliminate canine-transmitted human deaths by 2030. The Mission Rabies App is an mHealth innovation which greatly reduces the logistical and managerial barriers to implementing large scale rabies control activities. Free access to the platform aims to support pilot campaigns to better structure and report on proof-of-concept initiatives, clearly presenting outcomes and opportunities for expansion. The functionalities of the Mission Rabies App may also be beneficial to other infectious disease interventions.

While we know that there is an increase in prevalence of childhood and adolescence obesity, incidence studies must be carried out. The main objective of this study was to determine childhood obesity incidence and its potential predictors in Tehranian urban population.
   Methods: This study was conducted within the framework of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS), addressing incidence and risk factors of obesity throughout several phases from 1999-2001 to 2009-2011 among Tehranian urban population. Total study subjects were 1033 non-obese children, aged between 7 to 11 years, with a median 8.7 years of follow-up. Body mass Index (BMI) was used to define obesity and overweight based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, and definition of metabolic syndrome (MetS) for children was based on the Cook survey. Cumulative incidence of obesity and obesity incidence rates were calculated for each gender. Cox proportional hazard models was used to estimate potential risk factors of obesity.
   Results: Our Participants had a mean age of 9.2 +/- 1.4 years, mean BMI of 16.1 +/- 2.2 kg/m(2) and mean waist circumference (WC) of 57.2 +/- 6.7 at baseline. Total cumulative incidence of obesity was calculated to be 17%, CI = 14.1-20.4 for whole population (19.6%, CI = 15.4-24.8 for boys and 14.5%, CI = 10.9-19.1 for girls). Participants which were in the age group of 7-9 years at baseline experienced higher rate of cumulative obesity incidence compared to those who were in the age group of 10-11 years at baseline (22% vs 10.8%).
   In addressing risk factors, 5 parameters were significantly associated with obesity incidence: being overweight at baseline (HR = 14.93 95% CI: 9.82-22.70), having higher WC (HR = 5.05 95% CI: 3.01-8.48), suffering from childhood MetS (HR: 2.77 95% CI: 1.57-4.89) and having a obese father (HR: 2.69 95% CI: 1.61-4.50) or mother (HR: 3.04 95% CI: 1.96-4.72).
   Conclusion: Incidence of obesity is significantly high in Tehranian children, especially the age group 7-9 years. Best predictors of childhood obesity incidence are childhood overweight, WC above 90th percentile, childhood MetS and parental obesity.

AB Background: Educational attainment is associated with physical activity among older people. However, little is known about its association with sedentary lifestyle in European as well as Asian nations. This study aims to examine the associations between educational attainment and daily television viewing as an indicator of a sedentary lifestyle among older working and retired people in Finland and Japan.
   Methods: We used cross-sectional harmonized data from two cohorts, the Finnish Public Sector study (n = 10,744) and the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (n = 2493), evaluating individuals aged 65-75 years old. We defined high-duration television viewing as >= 4 h per day. Poisson regression was used to examine the association between educational attainment and high-duration television viewing, stratified by the current working status. Models were adjusted for age, sex, household size, smoking, alcohol, body mass index, chronic diseases, mental disorders, and physical activity.
   Results: Of the participants, 27% in Finland and 30% in Japan reported high-duration television viewing. Compared with a low education (<= 9 years), Finnish and Japanese retirees with a high education (>= 13 years) had less high-duration television viewing [prevalence ratio, PR 0.68 (95% confidence interval 0.63-0.73) and 0.66 (0.55-0.79), respectively]. The corresponding PRs for Finnish and Japanese retirees with intermediate education were also lowered [0.89 (0.83-0.95) and 0.79 (0.68-0.91), respectively]. Among older people still at work, educational attainment was associated with high-duration television viewing among the Japanese but not among the Finnish.
   Conclusion: A similar association between educational attainment and high-duration television viewing in Finland and Japan particularly after retirement suggests a robust and consistent impact of educational attainment on a sedentary lifestyle after retirements.

TI Constructing a DNA barcode reference library for southern herbs in
   China: A resource for authentication of southern Chinese medicine
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ITS2
AB Southern Chinese Medicine (SCM) is an important sect of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) with its own special cultural style. Species identification is essential for TCM quality control because authentic herbs are possibly substituted with adulterants that would threaten the health of the public or even cause death. Here, we provided the first local reference DNA barcode library based on the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) for the molecular identification of SCM. A total of 1512 specimens of southern herbs representing 359 species were collected under the instructions and identification of taxonomic experts. Genomic DNA was extracted, and the PCR reaction proceeded according to standard procedures. After Sanger sequencing, sequence assembling and annotation, a reliable ITS2 barcode library with 1276 sequences from 309 species of Southern herbs was constructed. The PCR efficiency of the whole samples was 84.39%. Characteristics of the ITS2 barcode were analyzed, including sequence lengths and GC contents in different taxa. Neighbor-joining trees based on Kimura 2-Parameter (K2P) genetic distances showed a 67.56% successful rate of species identification with ITS2 barcode. In addition, 96.57% of species could be successfully identified at the genus level by the BLAST method. Eleven plant species were discovered to be cryptic. In addition, we found that there is an incorrect sequence existing in the public database, making a reliable local DNA barcode reference more meaningful. ITS2 barcodes exhibit advantages in TCM identification. This DNA barcode reference library could be used in Southern Chinese Medicine quality control, thus contributing to protecting public health.

TI Mapping the yearly extent of surface coal mining in Central Appalachia

   DISTURBANCE; COVER
AB Surface mining for coal has taken place in the Central Appalachian region of the United States for well over a century, with a notable increase since the 1970s. Researchers have quantified the ecosystem and health impacts stemming from mining, relying in part on a geospatial dataset defining surface mining's extent at a decadal interval. This dataset, however, does not deliver the temporal resolution necessary to support research that could establish causal links between mining activity and environmental or public health and safety outcomes, nor has it been updated since 2005. Here we use Google Earth Engine and Landsat imagery to map the yearly extent of surface coal mining in Central Appalachia from 1985 through 2015, making our processing models and output data publicly available. We find that 2,900 km(2) of land has been newly mined over this 31-year period. Adding this more-recent mining to surface mines constructed prior to 1985, we calculate a cumulative mining footprint of 5,900 km(2). Over the study period, correlating active mine area with historical surface mine coal production shows that each metric ton of coal is associated with 12 m(2) of actively mined land. Our automated, open-source model can be regularly updated as new surface mining occurs in the region and can be refined to capture mining reclamation activity into the future. We freely and openly offer the data for use in a range of environmental, health, and economic studies; moreover, we demonstrate the capability of using tools like Earth Engine to analyze years of remotely sensed imagery over spatially large areas to quantify land use change.

TI PrEP implementation by local health departments in US cities and
   counties: Findings from a 2015 assessment of local health departments
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PREEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS; HIV PREVENTION; INFECTION
AB Objective
   The United States Public Health Service released clinical practice guidelines for daily oral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in May 2014. Local health departments (LHDs) are expected to play a critical role in PrEP implementation. We surveyed LHDs to assess awareness of and interest in supporting PrEP implementation, what roles they were taking, or believed they should take, in supporting PrEP, and what resources would be required to do so.
   Methods
   LHDs were surveyed in 2015 to assess their engagement in PrEP implementation (n = 500). The study employed a cross-sectional survey design with a randomly selected stratified sample.
   Results
   Among responding LHDs (n = 284), 109 (29%, weighted proportion) reported engagement in PrEP implementation. LHDs serving large jurisdictions (population 500,000+) and located in the West were more likely to be engaged in PrEP implementation. Making referrals for PrEP (74%) and conducting education and outreach to community members (51%) were the activities most frequently reported by LHDs engaged in PrEP implementation; 45% anticipated expanding their level of engagement. Among LHDs not engaged in PrEP implementation, 13% expected to become engaged over the next four years, 46% were undecided, and 41% reported it was unlikely. Information about PrEP for health care providers and information about PrEP for health department staff were the most frequently reported resource needs for LHDs engaged and not engaged in PrEP implementation, respectively.
   Conclusions
   PrEP implementation by LHDs was limited in 2015, three years after Food and Drug Administration approval and one year after the U.S. Public Health Service issued clinical practice guidelines. PrEP is a recently available intervention that is requiring LHDs to adjust existing HIV prevention efforts and service delivery models. Additional resources and implementation research is needed to effectively support PrEP scale-up by LHDs. Efforts must also be undertaken to increase PrEP awareness, knowledge, and implementation capacity among LHDs.

AB Background: As other westerns countries, a large portion of Norwegians do not meet the minimum recommendations for weekly physical activity (PA). One of the primary targets of the WHO's Global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases is to reduce insufficient PA by 10% within 2025. In order to effectively increase the PA levels in the population, an in-depth understanding of PA habits within different subgroups is therefore vital. Using a machine learning (ML) approach, the aim of this study was to investigate patterns and correlates of PA in adult Norwegians, as well as to construct a predictive model of future PA.
   Methods: Data were retrieved from the Norsk Monitor survey, which consists of about 3000 items on individual characteristics and sociocultural factors. The dataset contained information about 52,477 adult Norwegians, collected between 1985 and 2013. Past patterns and changes of three PA components (Frequency, Duration, and Intensity) were initially assessed using a series of ANOVAs. A Conditional Mutual Information Maximization Method and a recursive feature elimination with cross-validation were then used to examine the factors associated with such patterns and changes. Finally, the future evolution of the three PA components up to 2025 was predicted using an autoregressive model.
   Results: In line with previous literature, the analysis of the PA patterns showed a progressive increment of the PA Frequency (which was greater in women), while the PA Duration and Intensity (which were in general higher among men) resulted fairly stable. The PA correlates identified by the ML analysis, which include men and women of different age groups, are presented and discussed. The autoregressive model predicted a general increment of the PA Frequency and PA Intensity by 2025, while the PA Duration is predicted to reduce. Different patterns emerged among the different sub-groups, overall suggesting smaller increments of PA in men and older individuals, as compared to women and younger individuals.
   Conclusions: The findings of this study can inform public health efforts that aim at increasing PA levels in specific target groups. The ML approach is proposed as a useful tool in public health monitoring and assurance.

AB Background: Hypertension is a challenging public health problem with a huge burden in the developing countries. Non-adherence to antihypertensive treatment is a big obstacle in blood pressure (BP) control and favours disease progression to complications. Our objectives were to determine the rate of non-adherence to antihypertensive pharmacotherapy, investigate factors associated with non-adherence, and to assess the association between nonadherence and BP control in the Buea Health District (BHD), Cameroon.
   Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study using stratified cluster sampling was conducted in the BHD from November 2013 -March 2014. Eligible consenting adult participants had their BP measured and classified using the Joint National Committee VII criteria. The Morisky medication adherence scale was used to assess adherence to BP lowering medication. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to predict non-adherence.
   Results: One hundred and eighty-three participants were recruited with mean age of 55.9 years. Overall, 67.7% (95% CI: 59.8-73.6%) of participants were non-adherent to their medications. After adjusting for age, sex and other covariates, forgetfulness (aOR = 7.9, 95% CI: 3.0-20.8), multiple daily doses (aOR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.2-5.6), financial constraints (aOR = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.1-6.9) and adverse drug effects (aOR = 7.6, 95% CI: 1.7-33.0) independently predicted non-adherence to antihypertensive medication. BP was controlled in only 21.3% of participants and was better in those who were adherent to medication (47.5% versus 8.2%, p< 0.01).
   Conclusion: At least two of every three hypertensive patients in the Buea Health District are non-adherent to treatment. Forgetfulness, multiple daily doses of medication, financial constraints and medication adverse effects are the major predictors of non-adherence in hypertensive patients. These factors should be targeted to improve adherence and BP control, which will contribute to stem hypertension-related morbidity and mortality.
