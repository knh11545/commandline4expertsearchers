TI Palliative care for people living with HIV/AIDS: Factors influencing
   healthcare workers' knowledge, attitude and practice in public health
   facilities, Abuja, Nigeria
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID NURSES
AB Background
   Physicians and nurses play vital roles in addressing palliative care (PC) needs of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). The healthcare workers' (HCWs) experiences determine the success of palliative care delivery. There is paucity of data on PC for PLWHA. For this reason, we assessed the knowledge, attitude and practice of PC for PLWHA and associated factors among health care professionals.
   Methods
   We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study among HCWs in public health facilities in the Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria between February and May, 2017. Multistage sampling technique with proportionate-to-size allocation was used to determine facility sample size and HCWs per professional discipline. Data were collected with questionnaires adapted from Palliative Care Quiz for Nursing, Frommelt Attitude toward Care of the Dying and practical questions adapted from PC standard guidelines. Participants' knowledge, attitude and practice were assessed by awarding one (1) point for each correct answer; incorrect or "not sure" answers took a zero (0) score. Correct responses were summed up to get a total score for each participant. Descriptive statistics was done to describe frequencies and proportions displayed on tables. Linear regression was done to determine factors associated with HCW's knowledge, attitude and practice of PC for PLWHA
   Result
   With a 100% response rate, the mean age of the 348 participants was 37.5 years (SD: 8.9), 201 (57.8%) were female, 222 (63.8) were nurses and 230 (66.0%) had a work experience of 10 years or less. Majority of the participants, 310 (89.1%) agreed that palliative care focuses on the relief and prevention of suffering and 319 (91.7%) believe that PLWHA required palliative care. Misconceptions about palliative care include "palliative care is disease-oriented and not person oriented", 252 (72.6%) believed; "palliative care is concerned with prolongation of life", 279 (80.6%); and "use of placebos is appropriate in the treatment of some types of pain", 252 (72.6%). Among the participants, 52% disagreed that "palliative care should be given only for dying PLWHA" while only 18 (5.2%) were right on "family should be involved in the physical care of the dying PLWHA". Majority of the participants, 292 (84.1%) initiated palliative care discussion during patients' diagnosis while 290 (83.6%) informed terminally ill patients about their diagnosis. Regarding psychological issues, 22 (6.3%) participants hid the truth from the patients while 196 (56.3%) provided emotional support to the patients. Morphine 240 (69.0%) and Pentazocine 194 (55.7%) were the most commonly used drugs for treatment of severe pain by participants across all centres.
   Conclusion
   In-service training and undergraduate training on palliative care were associated with knowledge and practice of palliative care for people living with HIV/AIDS. We recommended continuous quality in-service training and education on palliative care for HCWs. While we ensure voluntariness of participation and other ethical principles, the high response rate could be as a result of more motivated health worker than the norm. The results are unlikely to be representative of doctors and nurses in primary health care centres.

AB Dietary guidelines play a key role in setting standards for nutrition policies and promoting healthy eating. Like other public health guidelines, they are often influenced by political and economic factors that could place other concerns ahead of the population's health. In order to determine their effectiveness on obesity prevention, we prospectively examined the association between adherence to the latest available national dietary guidelines and the incidence of overweight/obesity in a Spanish cohort study. A sample of 11,554 participants of the "Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra" (SUN) cohort, initially free of overweight or obesity, was included in the study. The Spanish Society of Community Nutrition (SENC) food pyramid (FP) score was computed based on the ratio of consumed to recommended daily servings of grains, fruits, vegetables, dairy, protein-rich foods, olive oil, red and processed meat, sweets, salty snacks and spreadable fats, fermented alcoholic beverages and water. The same approach was followed to calculate the SENC hydration pyramid (HP) score, considering the intake of water and different kind of beverages. Adherence was calculated at baseline and after 10 years of follow-up. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the incidence of overweight/obesity (BMI >= 25 kg/m(2)). During a median follow-up of 10.3 years, 2320 incident cases were identified. The highest level of adherence to the SENC FP score was modestly associated with a reduced risk of overweight/obesity (multi variable-adjusted HR for the fifth quintile vs. the first quintile = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.67-0.91; p-trend: 0.007). No consistent trends were found for the SENC HP. In a large prospective cohort of Spanish university graduates, we found an inverse linear association between adherence to the SENC FP and overweight/obesity risk, whereas this was not the case for the HP.

TI Kyasanur Forest Disease vaccination coverage and its perceived barriers
   in Goa, India-A mixed methods operational research
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID OUTBREAK
AB Background
   Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) is a highly infectious viral illness transmitted by infected ticks through contact with monkeys and other forest animals. Till date there is no definite treatment available for KFD. Hence, vaccination is considered to be an important public health intervention to control KFD. This study aimed at estimating the vaccination coverage for primary and booster doses of KFD vaccine and exploring the perceived barriers to vaccination in the affected villages of Goa, India during 2015-18.
   Methodology & principal findings
   In this explanatory mixed methods study, vaccine coverage was estimated bydata obtained from the KFD vaccination registers maintained at the health centers catering to the KFD affected villages. To understand the barriers to vaccination,key informant interviews were conducted among implementing health officers, medical officers and nurses involved in vaccination. Perceptions of vaccinees and community members were studied through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions.
   Out of the 35,500 targeted population (6-65 years)for KFD vaccination, 32% received one dose and 13.2% received two doses. The coverage for first booster and annual booster was 4.9% and 0.5% respectively. The drop out from first to second and third doses was 57% and 85% respectively. 69% of doses were delivered during community outreach programmes and remaining at health facilities. Inadequate vaccine stock, inappropriate timing of vaccination campaign, lack of awareness and misconceptions related to indications of vaccines, travel distance for follow up doses given at community health centre and pain due to injection were perceived as reasons for poor vaccination coverage.
   Conclusions
   KFD vaccination coverage was poor in the villages affected by KFD in Goa. Both left-out and drop-out phenomena were observed in KFD vaccination. Vaccine implementation plan has to consider suitable time for the local people, maintain adequate vaccine stock and encourage community-based vaccination campaigns instead of facility-based to achieve optimal vaccine coverage.

TI Infection prevention preparedness and practices for female sterilization
   services within primary care facilities in Northern India
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID QUALITY-OF-CARE; CONTRACEPTIVE USE; HEALTH; IMPACT; DEATHS; REDUCTION;
   DEMAND
AB Background: In 2014, 16 women died following female sterilization operations in Bilaspur, a district in central India. In addition to those 16 deaths, 70 women were hospitalized for critical conditions (Sharma, Lancet 384,2014). Although the government of India's guidelines for female sterilization mandate infection prevention practices, little is known about the extent of infection prevention preparedness and practice during sterilization procedures that are part of the country's primary health care services. This study assesses facility readiness for infection prevention and adherence to infection prevention practices during female sterilization procedures in rural northern India.
   Method: The data for this study were collected in 2016-2017 as part of a family planning quality of care survey in selected public health facilities in Bihar (n = 100), and public (n = 120) and private health facilities (n = 97) in Uttar Pradesh. Descriptive analysis examined the extent of facility readiness for infection prevention (availability of handwashing facilities, new or sterilized gloves, antiseptic lotion, and equipment for sterilization). Correlation and multivariate statistical methods were used to examine the role of facility readiness and provider behaviors on infection prevention practices during female sterilization.
   Result: Across the three health sectors, 62% of facilities featured all four infection prevention components. Sterilized equipment was lacking in all three health sectors. In facilities with all four components, provider adherence to infection prevention practices occurred in only 68% of female sterilization procedures. In Bihar, 76% of public health facilities evinced all four components of infection prevention, and in those facilities provider's adherence to infection prevention practices was almost universal. In Uttar Pradesh, where only 55% of public health facilities had all four components, provider adherence to infection prevention practices occurred in only 43% of female sterilization procedures.
   Conclusion: The findings suggest that facility preparedness for infection prevention does play an important role in provider adherence to infection prevention practices. This phenomenon is not universal, however. Not all doctors from facilities prepared for infection prevention adhere to the practices, highlighting the need to change provider attitudes. Unprepared facilities need to procure required equipment and supplies to ensure the universal practice of infection prevention.

AB Background: Clinical supervision is recommended for allied health professionals for the purpose of supporting them in their professional role, continued professional development and ensuring patient safety and high quality care. The aim of this mixed methods study was to explore allied health professionals' perceptions about the aspects of clinical supervision that can facilitate effective clinical supervision.
   Methods: Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted on a purposive sample of 38 allied health professionals working in a metropolitan public hospital. Qualitative analysis was completed using an interpretive description approach. To enable triangulation of qualitative data, a quantitative descriptive survey of clinical supervision effectiveness was also conducted using the Manchester Clinical Supervision Scale (MCSS-26).
   Results: Three main themes emerged from qualitative analysis: Allied health professionals reported that clinical supervision was most effective when their professional development was the focus of clinical supervision; the supervisor possessed the skills and attributes required to facilitate a constructive supervisory relationship; and the organisation provided an environment that facilitated this relationship together with their own professional development. Three subthemes also emerged within each of the main themes: the importance of the supervisory relationship; prioritisation of clinical supervision relative to other professional duties; and flexibility of supervision models, processes and approaches to clinical supervision. The mean MCSS-26 score was 79.2 (95%CI 73.7 to 84.3) with scores ranging from 44 to 100. MCSS-26 results converged with the qualitative findings with participants reporting an overall positive experience with clinical supervision.
   Conclusions: The factors identified by allied health professionals that influenced the effectiveness of their clinical supervision were mostly consistent among the professions. However, allied health professionals reported using models of clinical supervision that best suited their profession's role and learning style. This highlighted the need for flexible approaches to allied health clinical supervision that should be reflected in clinical supervision policies and guidelines. Many of the identified factors that influence the effectiveness of clinical supervision of allied health professionals can be influenced by health organisations.

AB Background Despite the adoption of the provider-initiated HIV testing strategy, the rate of HIV testing is still very low in sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of this study was to assess the factors associated with HIV testing among sexually active women and men in Senegal. Knowledge of HIV status is the gateway to antiretroviral treatment. Methods A secondary analysis of the 2017 Senegal Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) was performed, using data on sexually active women aged 15-49 and men aged 15-59. The outcome variable was the proportion of women and men who reported ever being tested for HIV in the last 12 months before the survey. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the socio-demographic, HIV-knowledge, media exposure, and behavioral factors associated with HIV testing in Senegal. Results The study found that 61.1% (95%CI: 59.2-62.9) of women and 26.2% (95%CI: 24.2-28.3) of men were tested for HIV at the last 12 months. In multivariate analysis, among men the factors independently associated with being tested for HIV were: age groups 20-24 to 40-44 and age group 50-54; a higher level of education; being in the richest household wealth quintile; being married; knowing about the efficacy of HAART during pregnancy; having 2 or more lifetime sex partners and owning a mobile phone. Among women factors independently associated with HIV testing were: being in any age groups versus 15-19; a higher level of education; being in the richest household wealth quintile; being married; knowing about the efficacy of HAART during pregnancy; having any STI in last 12 months; fearing stigma; owning a mobile phone; and having any number of ANC visits, versus none. Conclusion Although HIV remains a public health threat, HIV testing's prevalence is still low in Senegal, making it difficult to interrupt the transmission chain within the community and to reach the UNAIDS goal for 2020 of "90-90-90". Innovative community-based strategies are needed to address barriers and improve access to HIV testing in Senegal, particularly for men and for the youngest and poorest populations.

AB Objective
   The Job Demands and Control model classifies job types as active, passive, low-strain or high-strain, based on a combination of job demands and control. While studies have shown high-strain jobs to have adverse consequences for health and work participation, prognostic factors for the four job types have been less explored. The aim of this study was to assess the associations between sociodemographic factors and job descriptors and being in high-strain, low-strain, active and passive jobs.
   Methods
   The WIRUS Screening study targeted Norwegian employees in private and public enterprises. In this study, associations with job types among 4,487 employees were investigated with binary logistic regression analyses, adjusting for sociodemographic and job-related variables.
   Results
   In fully adjusted models, high-strain job was associated with female gender; lower education; shift work; and doing work outside the workplace. Low-strain job was associated with opposite scores on the same variables, and with lower job position. Active job was associated with lower age; female gender; higher levels of education; higher job position level; shift work; and not doing work outside the workplace. Passive job was associated with opposite scores on the same variables.
   Conclusions
   The study corroborates the role gender and education have for experiencing the job, and expands on existing knowledge on the role of job position and irregular working hours and spaces. By identifying factors associated with job types, the prevention of health problems and work disability may become be more targeted.

TI Measuring and addressing the childhood tuberculosis reporting gaps in
   Pakistan: The first ever national inventory study among children
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CHALLENGES; CONTACTS; BURDEN
AB Introduction
   Tuberculosis in children may be difficult to diagnose and is often not reported to routine surveillance systems. Understanding and addressing the tuberculosis (TB) case detection and reporting gaps strengthens national routine TB surveillance systems.
   Objective
   The present study aimed to measure the percentage of childhood TB cases that are diagnosed but not reported to the national surveillance system in Pakistan.
   Design
   The study design was cross sectional. The study was nationwide in 12 selected districts across Pakistan, each representing a cluster. Health facilities that diagnose and treat childhood TB from all sectors were mapped and invited to participate. Lists of child TB cases were created for the study period (April-June 2016) from all study facilities and compared against the list of child TB cases notified to the national TB surveillance system for the same districts and the same period.
   Results
   All public and private health facilities were mapped across 12 sampled districts in Pakistan and those providing health services to child TB cases were included in the study. From all private health facilities, 7,125 children were found with presumptive TB during the study period. Of them, 5,258 were diagnosed with tuberculosis: 11% were bacteriologically-confirmed and 89% clinically-diagnosed; only 4% were notified to National TB Control Program. An additional 1,267 children with TB were also registered in the National TB Control Program. Underreporting was measured to be 78%.
   Conclusion
   This is the first nationwide childhood TB inventory study globally and confirmed that childhood TB underreporting is very high in Pakistan. TB surveillance in the country must be strengthened to address this, with particular attention to guiding and supporting general practitioners and pediatricians to notify their TB cases.

SO PLOS ONE

AB The liver flukes, Fasciola hepatica and F. gigantica, are common trematode parasites of livestock. F. hepatica is known to modulate the immune response, including altering the response to co-infecting pathogens. Bovine tuberculosis (bTB), caused by Mycobacterium bovis, is a chronic disease which is difficult to control and is of both animal welfare and public health concern. Previous research has suggested that infection with liver fluke may affect the accuracy of the bTB skin test, but direction of the effect differs between studies. In a systematic review of the literature, all experimental and observational studies concerning co-infection with these two pathogens were sought. Data were extracted on the association between fluke infection and four measures of bTB diagnosis or pathology, namely, the bTB skin test, interferon gamma test, lesion detection and culture/bacterial recovery. Of a large body of literature dating from 1950 to 2019, only thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. These included studies of experimentally infected calves, case control studies on adult cows, cross sectional abattoir studies and a herd level study. All the studies had a medium or high risk of bias. The balance of evidence from the 13 studies included in the review suggests that liver fluke exposure was associated with either no effect or a decreased response to all of the four aspects of bTB diagnosis assessed: skin test, I FN gamma, lesion detection and mycobacteria cultured or recovered. Most studies showed a small and/or non-significant effect so the clinical and practical importance of the observed effect is likely to be modest, although it could be more significant in particular groups of animals, such as dairy cattle.

AB Feral pigeons, common wood pigeons and Eurasian collared doves are the most common representatives of the Columbidae family in Switzerland and are mostly present in highly populated, urban areas. Pigeons may carry various members of the obligate intracellular Chlamydiaceae family, particularly Chlamydia (C.) psittaci, a known zoonotic agent, and C. avium. The objective of the study was to identify the infection rates of common free-roaming pigeons for different Chlamydia species with the overall aim to assess the risk pigeons pose to public health. In this study, 431 pigeons (323 feral pigeons, 34 domestic pigeons, 39 Eurasian collared doves, 35 common wood pigeons) from several geographic locations in Switzerland were investigated for the presence of Chlamydiaceae. Samples consisted of pooled choanal-cloacal swabs (n = 174), liver samples (n = 52), and paired swab and liver samples from 205 pigeons (n = 410). All 636 samples were screened using a Chlamydiaceae family-specific 23S rRNA real-time PCR (qPCR). Subsequent species identification was performed by DNA-microarray assay, sequencing of a 16S rRNA gene fragment and a C. psittaci specific qPCR. In total, 73 of the 431 pigeons tested positive for Chlamydiaceae, of which 68 were positive for C. psittaci, four were C. avium-positive and one pigeon was co-infected with C. avium and C. psittaci. The highest infection rates were detected in feral (64/323) and domestic pigeons (5/34). Common wood pigeons (2/35) and Eurasian collared doves (2/39) revealed lower infection rates. Additionally, multilocus sequence typing of twelve selected C. psittaci-positive samples revealed closely related sequence types (ST) between and within different Swiss cities. Furthermore, liver and corresponding swab samples from the same bird were colonized by the same ST. Considering the high infection rates of C. psittaci in domestic and feral pigeons, close or frequent contact to these birds poses a human health risk.

   COST-EFFECTIVENESS; NANTUCKET-ISLAND
AB Background
   Babesiosis is a parasitic vector-borne disease of increasing public health importance. Since the first human case was reported in 1957, zoonotic species have been reported on nearly every continent. Zoonotic Babesia is vectored by Ixodes ticks and is commonly transmitted in North America by Ixodes scapularis, the tick species responsible for transmitting the pathogens that also cause Lyme disease, Powassan virus, and anaplasmosis in humans. Predicted climate change is expected to impact the spread of vectors, which is likely to affect the distribution of vector-borne diseases including human babesiosis.
   Methods
   A scoping review has been executed to characterize the global evidence on zoonotic babesiosis. Articles were compiled through a comprehensive search of relevant bibliographic databases and targeted government websites. Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts for relevance and characterized full-text articles using a relevance screening and data characterization tool developed a priori.
   Results
   This review included 1394 articles relevant to human babesiosis and/or zoonotic Babesia species. The main zoonotic species were B. microti, B. divergens, B. duncani and B. venatorum. Articles described a variety of study designs used to study babesiosis in humans and/or zoonotic Babesia species in vectors, animal hosts, and in vitro cell cultures. Topics of study included: pathogenesis (680 articles), epidemiology (480), parasite characterization (243), diagnostic test accuracy (98), mitigation (94), treatment (65), transmission (54), surveillance (29), economic analysis (7), and societal knowledge (1). No articles reported predictive models investigating the impact of climate change on Babesia species.
   Conclusion
   Knowledge gaps in the current evidence include research on the economic burden associated with babesiosis, societal knowledge studies, surveillance of Babesia species in vectors and animal hosts, and predictive models on the impact of climate change. The scoping review results describe the current knowledge and knowledge gaps on zoonotic Babesia which can be used to inform future policy and decision making.

AB Background: With the global spread of multidrug resistance in pathogenic microbes, infectious diseases emerge as a key public health concern of the recent time. Identification of host genes associated with infectious diseases will improve our understanding about the mechanisms behind their development and help to identify novel therapeutic targets.
   Results: We developed a machine learning techniques-based classification approach to identify infectious disease-associated host genes by integrating sequence and protein interaction network features. Among different methods, Deep Neural Networks (DNN) model with 16 selected features for pseudo-amino acid composition (PAAC) and network properties achieved the highest accuracy of 86.33% with sensitivity of 85.61% and specificity of 86.57%. The DNN classifier also attained an accuracy of 83.33% on a blind dataset and a sensitivity of 83.1% on an independent dataset. Furthermore, to predict unknown infectious disease-associated host genes, we applied the proposed DNN model to all reviewed proteins from the database. Seventy-six out of 100 highly-predicted infectious disease-associated genes from our study were also found in experimentally-verified human-pathogen protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Finally, we validated the highly-predicted infectious disease-associated genes by disease and gene ontology enrichment analysis and found that many of them are shared by one or more of the other diseases, such as cancer, metabolic and immune related diseases.
   Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first computational method to identify infectious disease-associated host genes. The proposed method will help large-scale prediction of host genes associated with infectious-diseases. However, our results indicated that for small datasets, advanced DNN-based method does not offer significant advantage over the simpler supervised machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) or Random Forest (RF) for the prediction of infectious disease-associated host genes. Significant overlap of infectious disease with cancer and metabolic disease on disease and gene ontology enrichment analysis suggests that these diseases perturb the functions of the same cellular signaling pathways and may be treated by drugs that tend to reverse these perturbations. Moreover, identification of novel candidate genes associated with infectious diseases would help us to explain disease pathogenesis further and develop novel therapeutics.

AB Background: Currently, formal mechanisms for bioinformatics support are limited. The H3Africa Bioinformatics Network has implemented a public and freely available Helpdesk (HD), which provides generic bioinformatics support to researchers through an online ticketing platform. The following article reports on the H3ABioNet HD (H3A-HD)'s development, outlining its design, management, usage and evaluation framework, as well as the lessons learned through implementation.
   Results: The H3A-HD evaluated using automatically generated usage logs, user feedback and qualitative ticket evaluation. Evaluation revealed that communication methods, ticketing strategies and the technical platforms used are some of the primary factors which may influence the effectivity of HD.
   Conclusion: To continuously improve the H3A-HD services, the resource should be regularly monitored and evaluated. The H3A-HD design, implementation and evaluation framework could be easily adapted for use by interested stakeholders within the Bioinformatics community and beyond.

AB Background: Measuring family members' satisfaction with inpatient psychiatric care may help improve the quality of healthcare in psychiatric hospitals. This survey aimed to investigate the satisfaction of family members with inpatient psychiatric care and to explore its associated factors, using a newly-developed 5-item questionnaire.
   Methods: This study included 1598 family members of psychiatric inpatients in 32 tertiary public psychiatric hospitals in 29 provinces of China. Satisfaction and demographic data were collected by research staff while patient and hospital data were retrieved separately.
   Results: We found that the overall satisfaction level was 93.84% (23.46/25). The total satisfaction score in Northeast China was the highest, followed by the East, Middle and West regions (p < 0.001). There was no significant sex difference in total family satisfaction scores. Family members with a lower educational background (elementary school or less) had significantly lower satisfaction. Family members of patients who were diagnosed with schizophrenia were significantly less satisfied with doctor-family communication. In different treatment response subgroups, the marked improvement subgroup had significantly higher total satisfaction scores and subscores. Meanwhile, lower self-payment expenses and a higher number of psychologic treatments offered per day were significantly associated with higher total satisfaction scores and all subscores. Logistic regression showed a higher educational background, more psychologic treatments offered per day, adequacy of professional staffing (higher doctor/bed, nurse/bed and psychologist/bed ratio) were all significantly associated with higher family satisfaction.
   Conclusions: We suggest government and hospital managers recruit more mental health professions to improve family satisfaction. If feasible, providing more psychologic treatments to inpatients may also improve families' satisfaction and involvement.

AB Background: Measurement of breast cancer burden and identification of its influencing factors help in the development of public health policy and strategy against the disease. This study aimed to examine the variability of the excess mortality of female breast cancer patients in the North East Region of Peninsular Malaysia.
   Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted using breast cancer data from the Kelantan Cancer Registry between 2007 and 2011, and Kelantan general population mortality data. The breast cancer cases were followed up for 5 years until 2016. Out of 598 cases, 549 cases met the study criteria and were included in the analysis. Modelling of excess mortality was conducted using Poisson regression.
   Results: Excess mortality of breast cancer varied according to age group (50 years old and below vs above 50 years old, Adj. EHR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.31, 4.09; P = 0.004), ethnicity (Malay vs non-Malay, Adj. EHR: 2.31; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.96; P = 0.008), and stage (stage III and IV vs. stage I and II, Adj. EHR: 5.75; 95% CI: 4.24, 7.81; P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Public health policy and strategy aim to improve cancer survival should focus more on patients presented at age below 50 years old, Malay ethnicity, and at a later stage.

AB Background: There is rising public concern over the widening health inequalities in many countries. The aim of this study was to clarify the associations of socioeconomic status (SES)-related variables, such as levels of household disposable income and employment status, and lifestyle factors with mental health conditions among Japanese adults aged 40 to 69.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study of 3085 participants (1527 males and 1558 females) was undertaken by using a self-administered questionnaire that included the Japanese version of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and questions related to socioeconomic and lifestyle factors.
   Results: The prevalence of poor mental health conditions, represented by a GHQ-12 score of 4 or more, was 33.4% among males and 40.4% among females. Males whose annual household disposable income was less than 2 million yen had significantly higher GHQ-12 scores than those with an annual household disposable income above 2 million yen. As per binary logistic regression analyses, short sleep duration and the absence of physical exercise were significantly related to poor mental health conditions among both males and females. Among females, a household disposable income of less than 2 million yen could be a risk factor for poor mental health conditions. Age and habitual drinking were inversely associated with poor mental health conditions.
   Conclusions: Low levels of household disposable income and unhealthy lifestyle factors were significantly associated with mental health conditions. These results suggest the importance of improving unhealthy lifestyle behaviours and developing effective health promotion programmes. In addition, there is a need for social security systems for people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

ID SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; REPRODUCTIVE AGE; PREVALENCE; NUTRITION; ETHIOPIA;
   POVERTY
AB Background: Anemia is a public health problem in many developing countries. It affects a sizable proportion of women of reproductive age. Anemia increases the risk of morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases, and can lead to poor fetal outcomes, and low productivity. This study examined the trends and determinants of anemia among women of reproductive age in Uganda.
   Methods: This study analyzed data from the Uganda Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 2006, 2011, and 2016. The study was based on 10,956 weighted cases of women age 15-49. Bivariate analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis examined the association between the outcome variable and the determinants. Potential determinants of anemia in women were selected based on literature.
   Results: The results of the analysis show that anemia decreased in Uganda between 2006 and 2016, but with an increase between 2011 and 2016. The overall prevalence of anemia among women was 50, 23, and 32% respectively in 2006, 2011, and 2016. Women who were pregnant at the time of the survey had higher odds of being anemic across the surveys (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.49-2.67; OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.02-2.10; OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.07-1.65). Women in households with nonimproved sources of drinking water also had higher odds for anemia (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.09-1.61) in 2016. Wealth index, region and age were also significantly associated with anemia in women.
   Conclusion: In order to reduce anemia in women, there is need to target pregnant women during antenatal and postpartum visits, and ensure that nutrition education during such visits is supported. There is also need to ensure sustainable household access to safe water. This should be combined with interventions aimed at enhancing household wealth.

TI Leveraging incentives to increase HIV testing uptake among men:
   qualitative insights from rural Uganda
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE HIV testing; Men; Economic incentives; Lottery; Loss aversion; Sub
   Saharan Africa
ID MODEL
AB Background: Few studies have explored how economic incentives influence behavioral outcomes. This study aimed to identify pathways of action of an incentives-based intervention to increase men's participation in HIV testing.
   Methods: The qualitative study was embedded in a randomized-controlled trial that compared effectiveness of gain-framed, loss-framed and lottery-based incentives to increase HIV testing among men. Following testing at a community health campaign, 60 in-depth interviews were conducted with men systematically sampled on the basis of age, incentive group, and campaign attendance. Data were coded deductively and inductively for thematic content analysis.
   Results: Incentives addressed men's structural, interpersonal and individual-level barriers to testing: offered at convenient locations, incentives offset costs of testing, in lost wages, which are exacerbated when livelihoods required mobility. Interpersonal barriers included anticipated stigma/fear of disclosure, social obligations, and negative peer influences. Providing incentives in public settings provided "social proof" that prizes could be won, and facilitated social support and positive norms by promoting testing with trusted others. Incentives had little influence when men appraised prize values to be low, disbelieved they would win a prize, or were already intrinsically motivated to test. Yet, incentives provided a behavioral 'cue to action' for many men who perceived themselves to be susceptible to HIV and perceived HIV disease to be severe, acting as secondary motivator for testing that "sweetened the deal".
   Conclusion: Incentives can be an important 'lever' to promote men's healthy behaviors in resource-poor settings. HIV testing in convenient, public settings, when paired with incentives, provides multiple pathways to stimulate men's testing uptake.

AB Objectives: Invasive group A Streptococcus (iGAS) disease is serious and sometimes life-threatening. The Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance (PAEDS) Network collects voluntary notifications from seven major Australian paediatric hospitals on patients with certain conditions, including iGAS disease. Our aims were to: 1) Describe the epidemiological distribution of paediatric iGAS disease in Australia and correlate this with influenza notifications, 2) Identify GAS strains commonly associated with invasive disease in children.
   Methods: IGAS and influenza notification data were obtained (from the PAEDS Network and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, respectively, for the period 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2018). Included iGAS patients had GAS isolated from a normally sterile body site. Data were described according to selected clinical and demographic characteristics, including by age group and Australian State, with proportions and minimum incidence rates estimated.
   Results: A total of 181 patients were identified, with most (115, 63.5%) <5 years old. The mean annual minimum incidence rate was 1.6 (95% confidence interval: 1.1-2.3) per 100,000 children across the study period. An epidemiological correlation with the seasonal burden of influenza was noted. Contact prophylaxis was not consistently offered. Of 96 patients with emm-typing results available, 72.9% showed emm-1, -4 or - 12.
   Conclusions: Robust surveillance systems and cohesive patient management guidelines are needed. Making iGAS disease nationally notifiable would help facilitate this. Influenza vaccination may contribute to reducing seasonal increases in iGAS incidence. The burden of disease emphasises the need for ongoing progress in GAS vaccine development.

TI Top research priorities for preterm birth: results of a prioritisation
   partnership between people affected by preterm birth and healthcare
   professionals
SO BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
LA English
DT Article
ID JAMES-LIND-ALLIANCE
AB Background: We report a process to identify and prioritise research questions in preterm birth that are most important to people affected by preterm birth and healthcare practitioners in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland.
   Methods: Using consensus development methods established by the James Lind Alliance, unanswered research questions were identified using an online survey, a paper survey distributed in NHS preterm birth clinics and neonatal units, and through searching published systematic reviews and guidelines. Prioritisation of these questions was by online voting, with paper copies at the same NHS clinics and units, followed by a decision-making workshop of people affected by preterm birth and healthcare professionals.
   Results: Overall 26 organisations participated. Three hundred and eighty six people responded to the survey, and 636 systematic reviews and 12 clinical guidelines were inspected for research recommendations. From this, a list of 122 uncertainties about the effects of treatment was collated: 70 from the survey, 28 from systematic reviews, and 24 from guidelines. After removing 18 duplicates, the 104 remaining questions went to a public online vote on the top 10. Five hundred and seven people voted; 231 (45%) people affected by preterm birth, 216 (43%) health professionals, and 55 (11%) affected by preterm birth who were also a health professional. Although the top priority was the same for all types of voter, there was variation in how other questions were ranked.
   Following review by the Steering Group, the top 30 questions were then taken to the prioritisation workshop. A list of top 15 questions was agreed, but with some clear differences in priorities between people affected by preterm birth and healthcare professionals.
   Conclusions: These research questions prioritised by a partnership process between service users and healthcare professionals should inform the decisions of those who plan to fund research. Priorities of people affected by preterm birth were sometimes different from those of healthcare professionals, and future priority setting partnerships should consider reporting these separately, as well as in total.

ID OUTDOOR FALLS; ELDERLY-PEOPLE; HEALTH; HOME; CIRCUMSTANCES;
   CONSEQUENCES; PREDICTORS; MIGRATION; INDOOR
AB Background: Falls among older people have become a public health concern due to serious health consequences. Despite abundant literature on falls in older people, little is known about the rural-urban differentials in falls among older people in China. This research fills the voids of prior literature by investigating falls and the associated risk factors among Chinese seniors, with a particular focus on the rural-urban differences.
   Methods: Data are from the 2010 wave of Chinese Longitudinal Survey on Urban and Rural Elderly. The analysis includes 16,393 respondents aged 65 and over, with 8440 and 7953 of them living in urban and rural areas, respectively. Descriptive analyses are performed to examine incidence, locations, circumstances and consequences of falls in older people. Regression analysis is used to investigate the effects of risk factors on falls among older people in urban and rural China.
   Results: The incidence of falls is higher among rural than urban older people. In both settings, older people are more likely to fell outside of home. But common outdoor falls among rural and urban older people differ in terms of locations and circumstances. Urban older people are more likely to report falling on the road whereas their rural counterparts have experienced more falls in the yard. Falls occurring within homes or immediate home surroundings are also common; but few falls occurred in public areas. The rate of hospitalization of urban seniors after falling is higher than that of rural ones. Most risk factors of falls show similar than different effects on rural and urban elders' risks of falling.
   Conclusions: Incidence, locations, circumstances and consequences of falls vary among Chinese rural and urban older people. But most risk factors for falls show similar effects on rural and urban elders' odds of falling. Implications drawn from this research provide suggestions for the government and local agencies to develop suitable fall prevention strategies which may well be applicable to other countries.

TI Urban-rural disparities in treatment outcomes among recurrent TB cases
   in Southern Province, Zambia
SO BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
DE Recurrent tuberculosis; Death; Treatment outcomes; Rural; Urban
ID EXOGENOUS REINFECTION; TUBERCULOSIS PATIENTS; DISTRICT; RELAPSE; HIV
AB Background: At least 13-20% of all Tuberculosis (TB) cases are recurrent TB. Recurrent TB has critical public health importance because recurrent TB patients have high risk of Multi-Drug Resistant TB (MDR-TB). It is critical to understand variations in the prevalence and treatment outcomes of recurrent TB between different geographical settings.
   The objective of our study was to estimate the prevalence of recurrent TB among TB cases and compare risk of unfavorable treatment outcomes between rural and urban settings.
   Methods: In a retrospective cohort study conducted in southern province of Zambia, we used mixed effects logistic regression to asses associations between explanatory and outcome variables. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality and exposure was setting (rural/urban). Data was abstracted from the facility TB registers.
   Results: Overall 3566 recurrent TB cases were diagnosed among 25,533 TB patients. The prevalence of recurrent TB was 15.3% (95% CI: 14.8 15.9) in urban and 11.3% (95% CI: 10.7 12.0) in rural areas. Death occurred in 197 (5.5%), 103 (2.9%) were lost to follow-up, and 113 (3.2%) failed treatment. Rural settings had 70% higher risk of death (adjusted OR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.2 2.7). Risk of lost to follow-up was twice higher in rural than urban (adjusted OR: 2.0 95% CI: 1.3 3.0). Compared to HIV-uninfected, HIV-infected individuals on Antiretroviral Treatment (ART) were 70% more likely to die (adjusted OR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.2 3.1).
   Conclusion: Recurrent TB prevalence was generally high in both urban and rural settings. The risk of mortality and lost to follow-up was higher among rural patients. We recommend a well-organized Directly Observed Therapy strategy adapted to setting where heightened TB control activities are focused on areas with poor treatment outcomes.

   ACCESS; IMPACT
AB Background: Repeated outbreaks of emerging pathogens underscore the need for preparedness plans to prevent, detect, and respond. As countries develop and improve National Action Plans for Health Security, addressing subnational variation in preparedness is increasingly important. One facet of preparedness and mitigating disease transmission is health facility accessibility, linking infected persons with health systems and vice versa. Where potential patients can access care, local facilities must ensure they can appropriately diagnose, treat, and contain disease spread to prevent secondary transmission; where patients cannot readily access facilities, alternate plans must be developed. Here, we use travel time to link facilities and populations at risk of viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) and identify spatial variation in these respective preparedness demands.
   Methods and findings: We used geospatial resources of travel friction, pathogen environmental suitability, and health facilities to determine facility accessibility of any at-risk location within a country. We considered in-country and cross-border movements of exposed populations and highlighted vulnerable populations where current facilities are inaccessible and new infrastructure would reduce travel times. We developed profiles for 43 African countries. Resulting maps demonstrate gaps in health facility accessibility and highlight facilities closest to areas at risk for VHF spillover. For instance, in the Central African Republic, we identified travel times of over 24 h to access a health facility. Some countries had more uniformly short travel times, such as Nigeria, although regional disparities exist. For some populations, including many in Botswana, access to areas at risk for VHF nationally was low but proximity to suitable spillover areas in bordering countries was high. Additional analyses provide insights for considering future resource allocation. We provide a contemporary use case for these analyses for the ongoing Ebola outbreak.
   Conclusions: These maps demonstrate the use of geospatial analytics for subnational preparedness, identifying facilities close to at-risk populations for prioritizing readiness to detect, treat, and respond to cases and highlighting where gaps in health facility accessibility exist. We identified cross-border threats for VHF exposure and demonstrate an opportunity to improve preparedness activities through the use of precision public health methods and data-driven insights for resource allocation as part of a country's preparedness plans.

AB Background: Identification of antibiotic resistance genes from environmental samples has been a critical sub-domain of gene discovery which is directly connected to human health. However, it is drawing extraordinary attention in recent years and regarded as a severe threat to human health by many institutions around the world. To satisfy the needs for efficient ARG discovery, a series of online antibiotic resistance gene databases have been published. This article will conduct an in-depth analysis of CARD, one of the most widely used ARG databases.
   Results: The decision model of CARD is based the alignment score with a single ARG type. We discover the occasions where the model is likely to make false prediction, and then propose an optimization method on top of the current CARD model. The optimization is expected to raise the coherence with BLAST homology relationships and improve the confidence for identification of ARGs using the database.
   Conclusions: The absence of public recognized benchmark makes it challenging to evaluate the performance of ARG identification. However, possible wrong predictions and methods for resolving the problem can be inferred by computational analysis of the identification method and the underlying reference sequences. We hope our work can bring insight to the mission of precise ARG type classifications.

AB Background: Patient safety culture is one of the main components of the quality of health services and is one of the main priorities of health studies. Accordingly, this study aimed to determine and compare the views of healthcare staff on the patient safety culture and the impact of effective factors on patient safety culture in public and private hospitals in Tehran, Iran.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out on a sample of 1203 health care workers employed in three public and three private hospitals in Tehran, Iran. Stratified random sampling was used in this study. Data were collected using the Maslach burnout inventory and patient safety culture questionnaire (HSOPSC). IBM SPSS v22 and Amos v23 were used to perform path analysis.
   Results: Eight hundred sixty-seven (72.57%) females and 747 (27.43%) males with a mean age of 33.88 +/- 7.66 were included. The average percentage of positive responses to the safety culture questionnaire in public and private hospitals was 65.5 and 58.3%, respectively. The strengths of patient safety culture in public hospitals were in three dimensions including non-punitive response to errors (80%), organizational learning-continuous improvement (79.77%), and overall perceptions of patient safety (75.16%), and in private hospitals, were three dimensions including non-punitive responses to errors (71.41%), organizational learning & continuous improvement (69.24%), and teamwork within units (62.35%). The type of hospital and work-shift hours influenced the burnout and patient safety questionnaire scores (P-value < 0.05). The path analysis results indicate the fitness of the proposed model (RMSEA = 0.024). The results showed a negative impact of a work shift (beta = - 0.791), occupational burnout (beta = - 0.554) and hospital type (beta = - 0.147) on the observance of patient safety culture.
   Conclusion: Providing feedback on errors and requirements for the frequent incident reporting, and patient information exchange seem necessary to promote the patient safety culture. Also, considering the negative impact of the shift work and burnout on patient safety culture, by planning and managing these factors appropriately, correct actions could be designed to improve the safety culture.

AB Background: Mental disorders are a leading cause of global disability, driven primarily by depression and anxiety. Most of the disease burden is in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs), where 75% of adults with mental disorders have no service access. Our research team has worked in western Kenya for nearly ten years. Primary care populations in Kenya have high prevalence of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). To address these treatment needs with a sustainable, scalable mental health care strategy, we are partnering with local and national mental health stakeholders in Kenya and Uganda to identify 1) evidence-based strategies for first-line and second-line treatment delivered by non-specialists integrated with primary care, 2) investigate presumed mediators of treatment outcome and 3) determine patient-level moderators of treatment effect to inform personalized, resource-efficient, non-specialist treatments and sequencing, with costing analyses. Our implementation approach is guided by the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework.
   Methods/design: We will use a Sequential, Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) to randomize 2710 patients from the outpatient clinics at Kisumu County Hospital (KCH) who have MDD, PTSD or both to either 12 weekly sessions of non-specialist-delivered Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) or to 6 months of fluoxetine prescribed by a nurse or clinical officer. Participants who are not in remission at the conclusion of treatment will be rerandomized to receive the other treatment (IPT receives fluoxetine and vice versa) or to combination treatment (IPT and fluoxetine). The SMART-DAPPER Implementation Resource Team, (IRT) will drive the application of the EPIS model and adaptations during the course of the study to optimize the relevance of the data for generalizability and scale -up.
   Discussion: The results of this research will be significant in three ways: 1) they will determine the effectiveness of non-specialist delivered first- and second-line treatment for MDD and/or PTSD, 2) they will investigate key mechanisms of action for each treatment and 3) they will produce tailored adaptive treatment strategies essential for optimal sequencing of treatment for MDD and/or PTSD in low resource settings with associated cost information - a critical gap for addressing a leading global cause of disability.

TI Epidemiological scenarios for human rabies exposure notified in Colombia
   during ten years: A challenge to implement surveillance actions with a
   differential approach on vulnerable populations
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID TRANSMISSION
AB Based on notified cases of human rabies exposure and human deaths by rabies to Colombia public health surveillance system between 2007 and 2016, we conducted a spatiotemporal analysis to identify epidemiological scenarios of high human rabies exposure due to dogs, cats, bats, or farm animals (n = 666,411 cases). The incidence rate of human rabies exposures was analyzed by using geographical information system (spatiotemporal distribution and Cluster and Outlier Analysis (Anselin Local Moran's I)) data for all Colombian cities. The incidence rate of human rabies exposures due to dogs and cats showed an increasing trend, while aggression due bats and farm animals fluctuated throughout the analyzed period. Human deaths by rabies transmitted by cat and bat occurred in the Andean and Orinoquia regions, which had urban and rural scenarios. The urban scenario showed the highest exposure to human rabies due to cats and dogs in cities characterized with high human population density and greater economic development. In contrary, the highest human rabies exposure in the rural scenario was observed due to contact of mucosa or injured skin with the infected saliva of farm animals with the rabies virus, principally among workers in the agroforestry area. The inequality scenario showed some outlier cities with high human rabies exposure due to farm animals principally in the Pacific region (characterized by the highest poverty rates in Colombia), being Afro-descendant and indigenous population the most exposed. The highest exposure due to bats bite was observed among indigenous people residing in cities of the Amazon region as a dispersed population (Amazonian scenario). None of the high exposure scenarios were related to human deaths by rabies due to dogs aggression. The identified scenarios can help develop better surveillance systems with a differential approach to the vulnerable population and strengthening them in areas with rabies viral circulation.

AB BackgroundMultiple admissions for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC) are responsible for an important proportion of health care expenditures. Diabetes is one of the conditions consensually classified as an ACSC being considered a major public health concern. The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of diabetes on the occurrence of multiple admissions for ACSC.MethodsWe analysed inpatient data of all public Portuguese NHS hospitals from 2013 to 2015 on multiple admissions for ACSC among adults aged 18 or older. Multiple ACSC users were identified if they had two or more admissions for any ACSC during the period of analysis. Two logistic regression models were computed. A baseline model where a logistic regression was performed to assess the association between multiple admissions and the presence of diabetes, adjusting for age and sex. A full model to test if diabetes had no constant association with multiple admissions by any ACSC across age groups.ResultsAmong 301,334 ACSC admissions, 144,209 (47.9%) were classified as multiple admissions and from those, 59,436 had diabetes diagnosis, which corresponded to 23,692 patients. Patients with diabetes were 1.49 times (p<0,001) more likely to be admitted multiple times for any ACSC than patients without diabetes. Younger adults with diabetes (18-39years old) were more likely to become multiple users.ConclusionDiabetes increases the risk of multiple admissions for ACSC, especially in younger adults. Diabetes presence is associated with a higher resource utilization, which highlights the need for the implementation of adequate management of chronic diseases policies.

AB Background A growing body of evidence is beginning to highlight how mass incarceration shapes inequalities in population health. Non-Hispanic blacks are disproportionately affected by incarceration and criminal law enforcement, an enduring legacy of a racially-biased criminal justice system with broad health implications for black families and communities. Louisiana has consistently maintained one of the highest rates of black incarceration in the nation. Concurrently, large racial disparities in population health persist. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of all births among non-Hispanic black women in Louisiana in 2014 to identify associations between parish-level (county equivalent) prevalence of jail incarceration within the black population and adverse birth outcomes (N = 23,954). We fit a log-Poisson model with generalized estimating equations to approximate the relative risk of preterm birth and low birth weight associated with an interquartile range increase in incarceration, controlling for confounders. In sensitivity analyses, we additionally adjusted for the parish-level index crime prevalence and analyzed regression models wherein white incarceration was used to predict the risk of adverse birth outcomes in order to quantify the degree to which mass incarceration may harm health above and beyond living in a high crime area. Results There was a significant 3% higher risk of preterm birth among black women associated with an interquartile range increase in the parish-level incarceration prevalence of black individuals, independent of other factors. Adjusting for the prevalence of index crimes did not substantively change the results of the models. Conclusion Due to the positive significant associations between the prevalence of black individuals incarcerated in Louisiana jails and estimated risk of preterm birth, mass incarceration may be an underlying cause of the persistent inequities in reproductive health outcomes experienced by black women in Louisiana. Not only are there economic and social impacts stemming from mass incarceration, but there may also be implications for population health and health inequities, including the persistence of racial disparities in preterm birth and low birth weight.

AB BackgroundLate-life depression (LLD) is one of the most prevalent mental disorders in old age. It is associated with various adverse outcomes and frequent use of health care services thereby remaining a serious public health concern. Compared with depression in early adulthood, most treatment options of LLD are less effective. Psychotherapy may be particularly beneficial for LLD due to specific psychological conditions in old age and a low risk of side effects. Although cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is highly established and effective in depression in young and mid-life there is only a limited number of small studies on CBT in LLD. An LLD-specific CBT has not yet been compared to an active, but unspecific supportive psychological intervention in a multicentre trial.MethodsHere we present the design of the CBTlate trial, which is a multicentre, randomized, observer-blinded, active-controlled, parallel group trial. CBTlate aims at including 248 patients with LLD of both genders at 7 sites in Germany. The purpose of the study is to test the hypothesis that a 15-session individually-delivered CBT specific for LLD is of superior efficacy in reducing symptoms of depression in comparison with a supportive unspecific intervention (SUI) of the same quantity. The intervention includes 8weeks of individual treatment sessions twice per week and a follow-up period of 6months after randomization. The primary end point is the severity of depression at the end of treatment measured by the self-rated 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Secondary endpoints include depressive symptoms at week 5 and at follow-up (6months after randomization). Additional secondary endpoints include the change of depressive symptoms assessed with a clinician-rating-scale and a patient reported outcome instrument for major depressive disorder, anxiety symptoms, sleep, cognition, quality of life, and overall health status from baseline to end-of treatment and to end of follow-up. Add-on protocols include MRI and the collection of blood samples.DiscussionThis study is the first multicentre trial of a specific CBT intervention for LLD compared to an unspecific supportive psychological intervention administered in a specialist setting. It has important implications for developing and implementing efficient psychotherapeutic strategies for LLD and may be a significant step to broaden treatment options for people suffering from LLD.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03735576, registered on 24 October 2018); DRKS (DRKS00013769, registered on 28 June 2018).

TI The cost-effectiveness of screening tools used in the diagnosis of fetal

AB Background Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is characterized by physical and neurological abnormalities resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure. Though diagnosis may help improve patient outcomes, the diagnostic process can be costly. Subsequently, screening children suspected of FASD prior to diagnostic testing has been suggested, to avoid administering testing to children who are unlikely to receive a diagnosis. The present study set out to assess the cost-effectiveness of currently recommended FASD screening tools. Methods The screenings tools evaluated were chosen from Children's Healthcare Canada's National Screening Toolkit for Children and Youth Identified and Potentially Affected by FASD and include meconium testing of fatty acid ethyl esters (meconium testing) and the neurobehavioral screening tool (NST). An economic model was constructed to assess cost-effectiveness. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of findings. Costs reflect 2017 Canadian dollars and the perspective is the public healthcare system. Results Both screening tools evaluated resulted in reduced costs and fewer diagnosed years of life than a no screening strategy in which all children suspected of FASD receive diagnostic testing. The model predicts that screening newborns with meconium testing results in a reduced cost of $89,186 per 100 individuals screened and 38 fewer diagnosed years of life by age 18, corresponding to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $2359. Screening children with the NST resulted in a reduced cost of $183,895 per 100 individuals screened and 77 fewer diagnosed years of life by age 18, corresponding to an ICER of $2390. Conclusion Findings suggest that screening is associated with less use of healthcare recourses but also fewer years of life with an FASD diagnosis over a no screening strategy. Since diagnosis can be key to children receiving timely and appropriate health and educational services, cost-savings must be weighed against the fewer years of life with a diagnosis associated with screening.

AB Background Public health strategies to increase physical activity in low-income communities may reduce cardiovascular risk in these populations. This controlled trial compared the cardiovascular risk estimated by the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) over 12 months in formally active (FA), declared active (DA), and physically inactive (PI) patients attended by the 'Family Health Strategy' in low-income communities at Rio de Janeiro City, Brazil (known as 'favelas'). Methods Patients were matched for age and assigned into three groups: a) FA (supervised training, n = 53; 60.5 +/- 7.7 yrs); b) DA (self-reported, n = 43; 57.0 +/- 11.2 yrs); c) PI (n = 48; 57.0 +/- 10.7 yrs). FA performed twice a week a 50-min exercise circuit including strength and aerobic exercises, complemented with 30-min brisk walking on the third day, whereas DA declared to perform self-directed physical activity twice a week. Comparisons were adjusted by sex, chronological age, body mass index, and use of anti-hypertensive/statin medications. Results At baseline, groups were similar in regards to body mass, body mass index, triglycerides, and LDL-C, as well to FRS and most of its components (age, blood pressure, hypertension prevalence, smoking, HDL-C, and total cholesterol; P > 0.05). However, diabetes prevalence was 10-15% lower in DA vs. FA and PI (P < 0.05). Intention-to-treat analysis showed significant reductions after intervention (P < 0.05) in FA for total cholesterol (similar to 10%), LDL-C (similar to 15%), triglycerides (similar to 10%), systolic blood pressure (similar to 8%), and diastolic blood pressure (similar to 9%). In DA, only LDL-C decreased (similar to 10%, P < 0.05). Significant increases were found in PI (P < 0.05) for total cholesterol (similar to 15%), LDL-C (similar to 12%), triglycerides (similar to 15%), and systolic blood pressure (similar to 5%). FRS lowered 35% in FA (intention-to-treat, P < 0.05), remained stable in DA (P > 0.05), and increased by 20% in PI (P < 0.05). Conclusions A supervised multi-modal exercise training developed at primary care health units reduced the cardiovascular risk in adults living in very low-income communities. The risk remained stable in patients practicing self-directed physical activity and increased among individuals who remained physically inactive. These promising results should be considered within public health strategies to prevent cardiovascular disease in communities with limited resources.

AB Background Intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW) is a worldwide public health problem. One of the most frequent forms of this type of violence in western societies is psychological IPVAW. According to the European Union (EU) Fundamental Rights Association (FRA) the prevalence of psychological IPVAW in the EU is 43%. However, the measurement invariance of the measure addressing psychological IPVAW in this survey has not yet been assessed. Methods The aim of this study is to ensure the cross-national comparability of this measure, by evaluating its measurement invariance across the 28 EU countries in a sample of 37,724 women, and to examine how the levels of this type of violence are distributed across the EU. Results Our results showed that the psychological IPVAW measure presented adequate psychometric properties (reliability and validity) in all countries. A latent structure of one factor was supported and scalar invariance was established in all countries. The average levels of psychological IPVAW were higher in countries like Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Sweden compared to the rest of the EU countries. In many of the other countries the levels of this type of violence overlapped. Conclusion Our findings underlined the importance of using appropriate statistical methods to make valid cross-national comparisons in large population surveys.

AB Background The infection of HIV continues to be an important public health problem in Ethiopia. Disclosing own HIV positive result is crucial, and considered as a good indicator of behavior change towards HIV/AIDs. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to pool the prevalence of positive HIV status disclosure to sexual partners and determine the influence of selected factors. Methods This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in Ethiopia among HIV positive people receiving health care at health facilities. In this review, primary studies were searched in Medline via PubMed, Google scholar and Google up to November, 2018. Data on disclosure of HIV positive result, knowledge of partner's HIV status and prior discussion on HIV were extracted, and effect sizes like proportion and odds ratios were pooled. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed by chi-square and I2, and Egger test, respectively. Results A total of 12 studies with 4528 participants were included in to this review to estimate the prevalence of disclosure of HIV positive result to sexual partner, and 10 and 7 studies were included to determine the associations of the outcome variable with knowledge of sexual partner's HIV status and with prior discussion on HIV, respectively. The pooled prevalence of HIV status disclosure to sexual partner was 73% (95% CI: 64, 82%). Having the knowledge of sexual partner's HIV status [OR: 95%CI; 17.63 (7.88, 39.45)], and previous discussion on HIV [OR: 95% CI; 9.24 (5.56, 15.37)] increased the disclosure of own HIV positive result to sexual partner. The sub-group analysis indicated a prevalence of 74% in Oromia, 86% in Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples (SNNPR), 87% in Amhara, 73% in Addis Ababa, and 54% in Tigray. Conclusions Disclosure of HIV status to sexual partner is lower than expected. Knowledge of partner's HIV status and previous discussion on HIV were strong predictors of HIV positive status disclosure. Strategies helpful for encouraging open HIV discussion need to be strengthened to increase HIV positive result disclosure. Furthermore, since the heterogeneity of studies is high, large nationally representative study is suggested.

AB Background Contraceptive discontinuations for reasons other than the desire for pregnancy are a public health concern because of their negative effect on reproductive health outcomes. In Ethiopia, the contraceptive discontinuation rate is increasing; however the factors associated are poorly understood. So this study was aimed at assessing reasons and multilevel factors for unscheduled contraceptive use discontinuation. Methods This is a cross-sectional study of Ethiopian women who participated in the Ethiopian demographic health survey from January 18, 2016, to June 27, 2016. Ever using any contraceptive with in the calendar of the survey were an inclusion criteria for which 3835 women were found eligible. The data were analyzed using multilevel binary logistic regression in STATA version 14. Variables with p-value less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant, and reported using adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval. Median odds ratio and interval odds ratio, to quantify the magnitude of the general and specific contextual effect respectively, were used. Receiver operating characteristics curve and akaike's information criterion were used for model comparison. Result The prevalence of unscheduled contraceptive use discontinuation was 46.18% for the principal reason of method related problems (Side effects-45.3%, needing better method-33.6%, and inconvenience-21.1%,). Women heading a household (AOR = 1.281, 95%CI 1.079-1.520), women who had no work (AOR = 0.812, 95%CI 0.673, 0.979) compared to professionals, living in poorest house hold income (AOR = 0.753, 95%CI 0.567, 0.997) compared to middle, residing in community with low contraceptive utilization rate (AOR = 1.945, 95%CI 1.618, 2.339), residing in poor community (AOR = 0.763, 95%CI 0.596-0.997), and having more children, and region were found to be significant predictors of unscheduled contraceptive use discontinuation. Conclusion Method related problems were found to contribute for more than half of the contraceptive use discontinuation. Both individual and community level factors were found to significantly influence the Unscheduled contraceptive use discontinuation. The outcome was common in groups who could have more social interactions and knowledge on which myths and rumors are common. So strengthening the efforts to reduce contraceptive use discontinuation and quality of contraceptive service provision could be important.

AB Background Worldwide, fifteen percent (15%) of the world's population or one (1) billion people live with some form of disability. In Uganda, 12.4% of the Uganda's population lives with some form of disability and Kawempe division accounts for (22.6%) of all persons with disabilities living in Kampala district. Rehabilitation services are provided within Kawempe division at Mulago hospital physiotherapy department and Katalemwa rehabilitation center in Kampala district, Uganda at a free and a subsidized cost to help to improve the function, independence, and quality of life of persons with physical disabilities. However, many people with physical disabilities do not utilize the services and the reasons are not clear. Methods The study design was a descriptive cross-sectional study employing quantitative methods of data collection. A total of 318 participants were included in the study. Simple random sampling was used to select the study participants. Ethical issues were maintained at all levels during data collection and dissemination of results. Results The study revealed a prevalence of 26.4% of the utilization rehabilitation services among people with physical disabilities in Kawempe division, Kampala, Uganda. Factors that were significantly associated with utilization of rehabilitation services among people with physical disabilities at multivariable logistic regression analysis included; age (AOR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.12-0.74), socioeconomic status (AOR: 2.13; 95% CI: 1.03-4.41), education level (AOR: 4.3; 95% CI: 1.34-13.91) and awareness of the participants about the rehabilitation services (AOR: 5.1; 95% CI: 2.74-9.54) at p value <= 0.05. Conclusion The study revealed a prevalence of 26.4% of the utilization rehabilitation services among people with physical disabilities in Kawempe division, Uganda. Factors that were significantly associated with utilization of rehabilitation services included; age, socioeconomic status, education level and awareness of the participants about the services. Therefore, the government and other relevant stake holders should increase sensitization and awareness of rehabilitation services, their benefits and facilities providing such services to people with physical disabilities, healthcare professionals and the general public.

TI Survey on antimicrobial usage in local dairy cows in North-central
   Nigeria: Drivers for misuse and public health threats
SO PLOS ONE

AB Background
   Antimicrobials are used as a measure to maintain good health and productivity of lactating cows. This study assessed pastoralists' knowledge and practices regarding AMU in lactating cows; and risk pathways for AMR dissemination from cow milk to humans.
   Methods
   Interview questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Fulani pastoral communities. Frequencies and proportions were used for descriptive statistics. Chi-square test and multivariable logistic regressions were used for analytic statistics at 95% confidence level.
   Results
   All recruited 384 pastoral households participated. About 11% of participants indicated antimicrobials misuse as when given at under-dose, while 58.9% had no knowledge of what antimicrobial misuse entailed. Most participants (51.6%) were unaware about effects of improper AMU. Most respondents (61.7%) reported self-prescription of antimicrobials used on cows. Also, 67.4% of respondents reported arbitrary applications of antimicrobials used in cows, while 15% used antimicrobials to increase milk yield. Frequently used antimicrobials were: tetracycline (98.7%), penicillin (96.6%), streptomycin (95.8%) and sulfonamides (95.3%). Consumption of raw milk and milk products (p = 0.010); contacts with contaminated udder (p = 0.002); and aerosols of discarded contaminated milk P = 0.001) were perceived risk pathways for spread of antimicrobial resistance from cow milk. Improper AMU (p<0.001), non-enforcement of regulating laws (p<0.001), weak financial status (p<0.001), and low education and expertise (p<0.001) influenced antimicrobials misuse in lactating cows.
   Conclusions
   This study highlighted low levels of knowledge, risk perceptions and practices regarding AMU and AMR among survey pastoralists. This calls for education of the vulnerable populations on promotion of prudent AMU in lactating cows through 'One Health' approach, to assure food safety, food security, and public and environmental health.

TI The association between dengue incidences and provincial-level weather

SO PLOS ONE

AB Dengue and dengue hemorrhagic pose significant burdens in many tropical countries. Dengue incidences have perpetually increased, leading to an annual (uncertain) peak. Dengue cases cause an enormous public health problem in Thailand because there is no anti-viral drug against the dengue virus. Searching for means to reduce the dengue incidences is a challenging and appropriate strategy for primary prevention in a dengue outbreak. This study constructs the best predictive model from past statistical dengue incidences at the provincial level and studies the relationships among dengue incidences and weather variables. We conducted experiments for 65 provinces (out of 77 provinces) in Thailand since there is no dengue information for the remaining provinces. Predictive models were constructed using weekly data during 2001-2014. The training set are data during 2001-2013, and the test set is the data from 2014. Collected data were separated into two parts: current dengue cases as the dependent variable, and weather variables and previous dengue cases as the independent variables. Eight weather variables are used in our models: average pressure, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average humidity, precipitation, vaporization, wind direction, wind power. Each weather variable includes the current week and one to three weeks of lag time. A total of 32 independent weather variables are used for each province. The previous one to three weeks of dengue cases are also used as independent variables. There is a total of 35 independent variables. Predictive models were constructed using five methods: Poisson regression, negative binomial regression, quasi likelihood regression, ARIMA(3,1,4) and SARIMA(2,0,1)(0,2,0). The best model is determined by combinations of 1-12 variables, which are 232,989,800 models for each province. We construct a total of 15,144,337,000 models. The best model is selected by the average from high to low of the coefficient of determination (R2) and the lowest root mean square error (RMSE). From our results, the one-week lag previous case variable is the most frequent in 55 provinces out of a total of 65 provinces (coefficient of determinations with a minimum of 0.257 and a maximum of 0.954, average of 0.6383, 95% CI: 0.57313 to 0.70355). The most influential weather variable is precipitation, which is used in most of the provinces, followed by wind direction, wind power, and barometric pressure. The results confirm the common knowledge that dengue incidences occur most often during the rainy season. It also shows that wind direction, wind power, and barometric pressure also have influences on the number of dengue cases. These three weather variables may help adult mosquitos to survive longer and spread dengue. In conclusion, The most influential factor for further cases is the number of dengue cases. However, weather variables are also needed to obtain better results. Predictions of the number of dengue cases should be done locally, not at the national level. The best models of different provinces use different sets of weather variables. Our model has an accuracy that is sufficient for the real prediction of future dengue incidences, to prepare for and protect against severe dengue outbreaks.

TI Does completion of sputum smear monitoring have an effect on treatment
   success and cure rate among adult tuberculosis patients in rural Eastern
   Uganda? A propensity score-matched analysis
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   Tuberculosis is a global public health problem. Bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis (BC-PTB) patients require three sputum smear monitoring (SSM) tests to establish cure or treatment success, but few studies have assessed the relationship. We evaluated the effect of completing SSM on treatment success rate (TSR) among adult BC-PTB patients in rural eastern Uganda.
   Methods
   We conducted a propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis of a retrospective observational cohort data. Participants who completed SSM were matched to those who had not, through nearest neighbor 1:1 caliper matching. Balance of baseline characteristics between the groups was compared before and after PSM using standardized mean differences. Logistic regression analysis was performed in matched and unmatched samples, reported as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Robustness of the results to hidden bias was checked through sensitivity analysis. The primary outcome was TSR (treatment completion or cure), while the secondary was cure rate, measured as an individual outcome.
   Results
   Before PSM, 591 (72.3%) of the 817 participants had incomplete SSM, with statistically significant differences in baseline covariates between completers and non-completers. After PSM, there were 185 participants in either group, balanced on baseline covariates. Before PSM, SSM completion was not associated with TSR, with unadjusted (OR, 0.92; 95%CI, 0.32-2.63) and adjusted analysis (Adjusted OR, 1.32; 95%CI, 0.41-4.22). For cure rate, there was a statistically significant effect before (OR, 93.34; 95%CI, 29.53-295.99) and after adjusted analysis (Adjusted OR, 86.24; 95%CI, 27.05-274.94), although imprecise. In PSM analysis, SSM completion was associated with increased odds of cure (OR, 87.00; 95%CI, 12.12-624.59) but not TSR (OR, 1.67; 95%CI, 0.40-6.97).
   Conclusions
   Completing SSM increases cure but has no effect on TSR among adult BC-PTB patients in eastern Uganda. Implementation of SSM should be encouraged to ensure improvement in cure rates among tuberculosis patients in rural areas.

   CONSUMPTION; DAIRY CONSUMPTION
AB Background
   The Latin American (LA) region is still facing an ongoing epidemiological transition and shows a complex public health scenario regarding non-communicable diseases (NCDs). A healthy diet and consumption of specific food groups may decrease the risk of NCDs, however there is a lack of dietary intake data in LA countries.
   Objective
   Provide updated data on the dietary intake of key science-based selected food groups related to NCDs risk in LA countries.
   Design
   ELANS (Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health) is a multicenter cross-sectional study assessing food consumption from an urban sample between15 to 65 years old from 8 LA countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela). Two 24-HR were obtained from 9,218 individuals. The daily intake of 10 food groups related to NCDs risk (fruits; vegetables; legumes/beans; nuts and seeds; whole grains products; fish and seafood; yogurt; red meat; processed meats; sugar-sweetened beverages (ready-to-drink and homemade)) were assessed and compared to global recommendations.
   Results
   Only 7.2% of the overall sample reached WHO's recommendation for fruits and vegetables consumption (400 grams per day). Regarding the dietary patterns related to a reduced risk of NCDs, among the overall sample legumes and fruits were the food groups with closer intake to the recommendation, although much lower than expected (13.1% and 11.5%, respectively). Less than 3.5% of the sample met the optimal consumption level of vegetables, nuts, whole grains, fish and yogurt. Largest country-dependent differences in average daily consumption were found for legumes, nuts, fish, and yogurt. Mean consumption of SSB showed large differences between countries.
   Conclusion
   Diet intake quality is deficient for nutrient-dense food groups, suggesting a higher risk for NCDs in the urban LA region in upcoming decades. These data provide relevant and up-to-date information to take urgent public health actions to improve consumption of critically foods in order to prevent NCDs.

   INEQUITY
AB Background: Rapid ageing of the population and increasing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among the elderly is one of the major public health challenges in India. To achieve the Universal Health Coverage, ever-growing elderly population should have access to needed healthcare, and they should not face any affordability related challenge. As most of the elderly suffers from NCDs and achieving health-equity is a priority, this paper aims to - study the utilization pattern of healthcare services for treatment of NCDs among the elderly; estimate the burden of out-of-pocket expenditure for the treatment of NCDs among the elderly and analyze the extent of equity in distribution of public subsidy for the NCDs among the elderly.
   Methods: National Sample Survey data (71st round) has been used for the study. Exploratory data analysis and benefit incidence analysis have been applied to estimate the utilization, out-of-pocket expenditure and distribution of public subsidy among economic classes. Concentration curves and indices are also estimated.
   Results: Results show that public-sector hospitalization for NCDs among the elderly has a pro-rich trend in rural India. However, in urban sector, for both inpatient and outpatient care the poorest class has substantial share in utilization of public facilities. Same result is also observed for rural outpatient care. Analysis shows that out-of-pocket expenditure is very high for both medicine and medical care even in public facilities for all economic groups. It is also observed that medicine has the highest share in total medical expenses during treatment of NCDs among the elderly in both the region. Benefit incidence analysis shows that the public subsidy has a pro-rich distribution for inpatient care treatment in both the sectors. In case of outpatient care, subsidy share is the maximum among the richest in the urban sector and in the rural region the poorest class gets the maximum subsidy benefit.
   Conclusions: It is evident that a substantial share of the public subsidies is still going to the richer sections for the treatment of NCDs among the elderly. Evidences also suggest that procuring medicines and targeted policies for the elderly are needed to improve utilization and equity in the public healthcare system.

ID ALZHEIMER-DISEASE
AB Background: Cognitive decline has emerged as a significant threat to both public health and personal welfare, and mild cognitive decline/impairment (MCI) can further develop into Dementia/Alzheimer's disease. While treatment of Dementia/Alzheimer's disease can be expensive and ineffective sometimes, the prevention of MCI by identifying modifiable risk factors is a complementary and effective strategy.
   Results: In this study, based on the data collected by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through the nationwide telephone survey, we apply a data-driven approach to re-exam the previously founded risk factors and discover new risk factors. We found that depression, physical health, cigarette usage, education level, and sleep time play an important role in cognitive decline, which is consistent with the previous discovery. Besides that, the first time, we point out that other factors such as arthritis, pulmonary disease, stroke, asthma, marital status also contribute to MCI risk, which is less exploited previously. We also incorporate some machine learning and deep learning algorithms to weigh the importance of various factors contributed to MCI and predicted cognitive declined.
   Conclusion: By incorporating the data-driven approach, we can determine that risk factors significantly correlated with diseases. These correlations could also be expanded to another medical diagnosis besides MCI.

AB Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to global public health because it makes standard treatments ineffective and contributes to the spread of infections. It is important to understand AMR's biological mechanisms for the development of new drugs and more rapid and accurate clinical diagnostics. The increasing availability of whole-genome SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) information, obtained from whole-genome sequence data, along with AMR profiles provides an opportunity to use feature selection in machine learning to find AMR-associated mutations. This work describes the use of a supervised feature selection approach using deep neural networks to detect AMR-associated genetic factors from whole-genome SNP data.
   Results: The proposed method, DNP-AAP (deep neural pursuit - average activation potential), was tested on a Neisseria gonorrhoeae dataset with paired whole-genome sequence data and resistance profiles to five commonly used antibiotics including penicillin, tetracycline, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and cefixime. The results show that DNP-AAP can effectively identify known AMR-associated genes in N. gonorrhoeae, and also provide a list of candidate genomic features (SNPs) that might lead to the discovery of novel AMR determinants. Logistic regression classifiers were built with the identified SNPs and the prediction AUCs (area under the curve) for penicillin, tetracycline, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and cefixime were 0.974, 0.969, 0.949, 0.994, and 0.976, respectively.
   Conclusions: DNP-AAP can effectively identify known AMR-associated genes in N. gonorrhoeae. It also provides a list of candidate genes and intergenic regions that might lead to novel AMR factor discovery. More generally, DNP-AAP can be applied to AMR analysis of any bacterial species with genomic variants and phenotype data. It can serve as a useful screening tool for microbiologists to generate genetic candidates for further lab experiments.

AB Background
   In recent decades, hypertension has become a popular public health problem in China. In 2017, a cross-sectional survey about hypertension and sodium intake measured by 24-hour (24-h) urine was launched in Zhejiang Province, to provide the basis of the Chinese population to develop a salt reduction intervention and prevention of hypertension strategy.
   Methods
   Cross-sectional data were obtained from 7512 participants aged 18 to 69 years in Zhejiang Province of China by complex, multistage sampling methods. The survey included face-to-face questionnaires and physical examination among all participants. Blood pressures and the use of anti-hypertension medications were used to determine hypertension. One thousand five hundred participants of them were asked to collect 24-h urine to measure sodium and potassium levels to assess intake. All rates and means were weighted by sampling weight and population structure of the province.
   Results
   The weighted means of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were 127.78 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI], 127.21-128.36) and 79.40 mm Hg (95% CI, 79.04-79.76). The weighted hypertension prevalence was 30.41% (95%CI, 28.91-31.91). Among those classified as having hypertension, 43.55% (95%CI, 40.77-46.34) were aware of the fact that they were suffering from hypertension, 32.05% (95%CI, 29.49-34.61) of them reported taking anti-hypertension medications, only 14.48% (95%CI, 12.54-16.42) had their blood pressure controlled. The weighted means of 24-h urinary sodium was 165.52 mmol (standard deviation [SD], 2.92), representing that the mean intake of sodium chloride was 9.68g (SD, 0.17) through conversion.
   Conclusion
   These cross-sectional survey results show that hypertension and excessive sodium intake in adults are prevalent in Zhejiang Province, China. Salt reduction and prevention of hypertension is still an urgent public health work.

TI Are we prepared? The development of performance indicators for public
   health emergency preparedness using a modified Delphi approach
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   Disasters and emergencies from infectious diseases, extreme weather and anthropogenic events are increasingly common. While risks vary for different communities, disaster and emergency preparedness is recognized as essential for all nation-states. Evidence to inform measurement of preparedness is lacking. The objective of this study was to identify and define a set of public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) indicators to advance performance measurement for local/regional public health agencies.
   Methods
   A three-round modified Delphi technique was employed to develop indicators for PHEP. The study was conducted in Canada with a national panel of 33 experts and completed in 2018. A list of indicators was derived from the literature. Indicators were rated by importance and actionability until achieving consensus.
   Results
   The scoping review resulted in 62 indicators being included for rating by the panel. Panel feedback provided refinements to indicators and suggestions for new indicators. In total, 76 indicators were proposed for rating across all three rounds; of these, 67 were considered to be important and actionable PHEP indicators.
   Conclusions
   This study developed an indicator set of 67 PHEP indicators, aligned with a PHEP framework for resilience. The 67 indicators represent important and actionable dimensions of PHEP practice in Canada that can be used by local/regional public health agencies and validated in other jurisdictions to assess readiness and measure improvement in their critical role of protecting community health.

TI Internet use and self-rated health among Swedish 70-year-olds: a
   cross-sectional study

DE Digital divide; Internet use; Self-rated health

   PERFORMANCE; LONELINESS; PREDICTORS; DEPRESSION; MORTALITY
AB Background: The Internet is increasingly becoming an infrastructure for a number of services, both commercial, public (including health related) and personal. Using the internet have the potential to promote social interaction and social connectedness by upholding social networks and social contacts. However, Internet use is lower in older adults compared to other age groups. This digital divide is considered a risk to the health of older adults since it limits their participation in society, access and use of relevant health related information and services. This study focuses on whether there is an association between Internet use and self-rated health.
   Method: A cross-sectional population-based sample of 70-year-olds from The Gothenburg H70 Birth Cohort Study (n = 1136) was examined in 2014-16. All data was collected using structured interviews and questionnaires. Differences in proportions were tested with chi-square test and ordinary least square regression analysis was used to estimate the relationship between Internet use and self-rated health controlling for health factors, hearing and visual impairment, and social contacts.
   Results: There is a relationship between more frequent Internet use and good self-rated health (unstandardized beta 0.101 p < 0.001), and the effect remained after adjusting for all covariates (unstandardized beta 0.082 p < 0.001). Our results also show that, in comparison to health factors, Internet use is of minor importance to the SRH of older adults, since adding these improved the explanatory power of the model by approximately 400% (from 0.04 to 0.18).
   Conclusion: Although the direction of the relationship between more frequent interne use and better self-rated health is undetermined in the present study, it can be suggested that using the Internet informs and educates older adults, strengthening their position as active and engaged participants of society. It can also be suggested that those using the Internet report less loneliness and a possibility to establish new computer-mediated relationships within online communities. Further research needs to examine what aspects of Internet use, and in what contexts such positive perceptions arise.

AB Background: The burden of sepsis represents a global health care problem. We aimed to assess the case fatality rate (CFR) and its predictors in subjects with sepsis admitted to a general Italian hospital from 2009 to 2016, stratified by risk score.
   Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of all sepsis-related hospitalizations after Emergency Department (ED) visit in a public Italian hospital in an 8-year period. A risk score to predict CFR was computed by logistic regression analysis of selected variables in a training set (2009-2012), and then confirmed in the whole study population. A trend analysis of CFR during the study period was performed dividing patient as high-risk (upper tertile of risk score) or low-risk.
   Results: Two thousand four hundred ninety-two subjects were included. Over time the incidental admission rate (no. of sepsis-related admissions per 100 total admissions) increased from 4.1% (2009-2010) to 5.4% (2015-2016); P < 0.001, accompanied by a reduced CFR (from 38.0 to 18.4%; P < 0.001). A group of 10 variables (admission to intensive care unit, cardio-vascular dysfunction, HIV infection, diabetes, age >= 80 years, respiratory diseases, number of organ dysfunction, digestive diseases, dementia and cancer) were selected by the logistic model to predict CFR with good accuracy: AUC 0.873 [0.009]. Along the years CFR decreased from 31.8% (2009-2010) to 25.0% (2015- 2016); P = 0.007. The relative proportion of subjects >= 80 years (overall, 52.9% of cases) and classified as high-risk did not change along the years. CFR decreased only in low-risk subjects (from 13.3 to 5.2%; P < 0.001), and particularly in those aged >= 80 (from 18.2 to 6.6%; P = 0.003), but not in high-risk individuals (from 69.9 to 64.2%; P = 0.713).
   Conclusion: Between 2009 and 2016 the incidence of sepsis-related hospitalization increased in a general Italian hospital, with a downward trend in CFR, only limited to low-risk patients and particularly to subjects >= 80 years.

AB Background: Community acquired pneumonia is responsible for 16% of under 5 mortality in India, probably due to delayed recognition and qualified care seeking. Therefore these deaths could possibly be averted by creating community awareness and promoting care seeking from qualified physicians in the government system. The objective of study was to assess the effectiveness of facility-based and village-based behavior change communication interventions delivered to community using validated information, education and communication materials, along with infrastructural strengthening of health facilities, for change in care seeking from government system for community acquired pneumonia in rural Lucknow, India.
   Method: Community based open labeled behavioral trial in 2 by 2 factorial design was conducted in eight rural blocks of Lucknow, northern India. Trained community health workers conducted Pneumonia Awareness Sessions once a month for the care givers of children using validated information, education and communication materials either at the villages or at government health facilities. Prior infrastructural strengthening of public health facilities was done to provide optimal care to cases. Pre packed pneumonia drug kits were provided which had amoxicillin, paracetamol and an instruction card on their use as well as pictorial representation of danger signs of pneumonia.
   Results: Study lasted from October 2015 to September 2018. Adherence to conduct of facility-based intervention was 93.0% (279/300) and to village-based intervention was 73.4% (7638/10410). In village-based intervention there was 79.3% (p < 0.0001) increase from a baseline of 3.3% (14/420) and facility-based intervention 68.9% (p = 0.02) increase from a baseline of 5.35% (21/392) in cases of possible pneumonia treated at government health facilities.
   Conclusion: Conduct of structured pneumonia awareness session using validated information, education and communication material at village level with infrastructural strengthening resulted in improved qualified care seeking from government facilities for community acquired pneumonia.

AB Background: Low levels of physical activity (PA) and prolonged sitting time (ST) increase the risk of non-communicable diseases and mortality, and can be influenced by socio-demographic characteristics. The aim of this study was to use self-report data to characterise socio-demographic patterns of PA and ST in eight Latin American countries.
   Methods: Data were obtained from the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health (ELANS), a household population-based, multi-national, cross-sectional survey (n = 9218, aged 15-65 years), collected from September 2014 to February 2015. Transport and leisure PA and ST were assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-long version. Overall and country-specific mean and median levels of time spent in transport and leisure PA and ST were compared by sex, age, socioeconomic and education level.
   Results: Mean levels of transport and leisure PA were 220.3 min/week (ranging from 177.6 min/week in Venezuela to 275.3 min/week in Costa Rica) and 316.4 min/week (ranging from 272.1 min/week in Peru to 401.4 min/week in Ecuador). Transport and leisure PA were higher (p < 0.005) in men than women with mean differences of 58.0 and 34.0 min/week. The mean and median for transport PA were similar across age groups (15-29 years: mean 215.5 and median 120 min/week; 30-59 years: mean 225.0 and median 120 min/week; >= 60 years: mean 212.0 and median 120 min/week). The median time spent in transport and leisure PA between three strata of socioeconomic and education levels were similar. The prevalence of not meeting PA recommendations were 69.9% (95% CI: 68.9-70.8) for transport and 72.8% (95% CI: 72.0-73.7) for leisure. Men, younger people (15-29 years), individuals with higher socioeconomic and education levels spent significantly (p < 0.001) more time sitting than women, older people (30-59 years and >= 60 years) and those in the middle and low socioeconomic and education groups, respectively.
   Conclusions: Transport and leisure PA and ST range widely by country, sex, and age group in Latin America. Programs for promoting leisure and transport PA and reducing ST in Latin America should consider these differences by age and gender and between countries.

AB Background: Aedes aegypti-borne diseases are becoming major public health problems in tropical and sub-tropical regions. While socioeconomic status has been associated with larval mosquito abundance, the drivers or possible factors mediating this association, such as environmental factors, are yet to be identified. We examined possible associations between proximity to houses and roads and immature mosquito abundance, and assessed whether these factors and mosquito prevention measures mediated any association between household environmental factors and immature mosquito abundance.
   Methods: We conducted two cross-sectional household container surveys in February-March and November-December, 2017, in urban and rural areas of Quetzaltenango, Guatemala. We used principal components analysis to identify factors from 12 variables to represent the household environment. One factor which included number of rooms in house, electricity, running water, garbage service, cable, television, telephone, latrine, well, and sewer system, was termed "environmental capital." Environmental capital scores ranged from 0 to 5.5. Risk factors analyzed included environmental capital, and distance from nearest house/structure, paved road, and highway. We used Poisson regression to determine associations between distance to nearest house/structure, roads, and highways, and measures of immature mosquito abundance (total larvae, total pupae, and positive containers). Using cubic spline generalized additive models, we assessed non-linear associations between environmental capital and immature mosquito abundance. We then examined whether fumigation, cleaning containers, and distance from the nearest house, road, and highway mediated the relationship between environmental capital and larvae and pupae abundance.
   Results: We completed 508 household surveys in February-March, and we revisited 469 households in November-December. Proximity to paved roads and other houses/structures was positively associated with larvae and pupae abundance and mediated the associations between environmental capital and total numbers of larvae/pupae (p <= 0.01). Distance to highways was not associated with larval/pupal abundance (p >= 0.48). Households with the lowest and highest environmental capital had fewer larvae/pupae than households in the middle range (p < 0.01).
   Conclusions: We found evidence that proximity to other houses and paved roads was associated with greater abundance of larvae and pupae. Understanding risk factors such as these can allow for improved targeting of surveillance and vector control measures in areas considered at higher risk for arbovirus transmission.

AB Background: With rapid development of China's economy, there were over 68.7 million left-behind children (LBC) in China whose mental health has become a problem of public concern. The present cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the status of mental health and its associated factors of LBC aged 3-16 years old in both rural and urban areas.
   Methods: A total of 4187 children (aged 3-16), including 1471 LBC and 2716 non-left-behind children (NLBC), were recruited from 50 communities (22 in urban areas and 28 in rural areas) in Guangdong, China in August, 2014. The mental health problems were assessed using the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).
   Results: No statistically significant difference of SDQ subscales scores about difficulties were found between LBC and NLBC on the whole participants as well as in rural areas or in urban areas within the same age group after adjustments were made (all p > 0.05). However, compared with NLBC in the same areas, urban LBC tended to have higher prosocial behaviours scores, while rural LBC had the lowest prosocial behaviours scores not only in the whole age group but also in different age subgroups (p < 0.05). Besides, compared with urban LBC, rural LBC were not worse in SDQ subscales scores except for prosocial behaviour at 7-9 age group (p = 0.003). Furthermore, higher paternal educational level and longer duration of parental absence, were associated with less difficulties in both rural and urban LBC. Besides, shorter duration of talk per-time but higher communication frequency were associated with less difficulties in rural LBC.
   Conclusions: The present study demonstrated that in general, no difference of mental health problems were found between LBC and NLBC. Besides, longer duration of parental absence, shorter duration of talk per time but more communication frequency, and higher paternal educational level tend to have better development of mental health. The findings reinforce the importance of the stability of caregivers and the effective parent-child communication for Chinese rural LBC.

AB Background: Sexual violence is a global public health issue. It is a form of gender-based violence commonly experienced by women accessing mental health services. The biomedical model has been the dominant model of care in acute psychiatric units, however, there has been a global movement towards more gender-sensitive and trauma-informed models. To date, only a small amount of research has focused on evaluating these models of care and health professionals' experiences of providing this care. The aim of this study is to gain an in-depth understanding of healthcare professionals' perceptions of how Gender Sensitive Care (GSC) is enacted across acute psychiatric inpatient units for women who are survivors of sexual violence.
   Methods: This study used case study methodology and the Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) conceptual framework. NPT is a practical framework that can be used to evaluate the implementation of complex models of care in health settings. It included semi-structured interviews with 40 health professionals, document and policy reviews, and observations from four psychiatric inpatient units within a large Australian public mental health organisation. Data were examined using thematic and content analysis.
   Results: Themes were developed under the four NPT core constructs; 1) Understanding GSC in acute psychiatric units: "Without the corridors there's not a lot we can do", 2) Engagement and Commitment to GSC in acute psychiatric units: "There are a few of us who have that gender sensitive lens", 3) Organising, relating and involvement in GSC: "It's band aid stuff", 4) Monitoring and Evaluation of GSC in acute psychiatric units: "We are not perfect, we have to receive that feedback".
   Discussion: Many health professionals held a simplistic understanding of GSC and avoided the responsibility of implementing it. Additionally, the competing demands of the biomedical model and a lack of appraisal has resulted in an inconsistent enactment of GSC.
   Conclusions: Health professionals in this study enacted GSC to varying levels. Our findings suggest the need to address each NPT construct comprehensively to adequately implement GSC.

TI Implementing a national diabetes prevention programme in England:

SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH

DT Article
DE Diabetes; Prevention; Implementation; Health systems
ID LIFE-STYLE INTERVENTION; FOLLOW-UP; TYPE-2; FINLAND; DESIGN
AB Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is preventable through lifestyle intervention. Diabetes prevention programmes (DPPs) aim to deliver prevention-based behaviour change interventions to reduce incidence. Such programmes vary from usual primary care in terms of where, how, and by whom they are delivered. Implementation is therefore likely to face new commissioning, incentive and delivery challenges. We report on the implementation of a national DPP in NHS England, and identify lessons learned in addressing the implementation challenges.
   Methods: In 2017/18, we conducted 20 semi-structured telephone interviews covering 16 sampled case sites with the designated lead(s) responsible for local implementation of the programme. Interviews explored the process of implementation, including organisation of the programme, expectations and attitudes to the programme, funding, target populations and referral and clinical pathways. We drew on constant comparative methods to analyse the data and generate over-arching themes. We complemented our qualitative data with a survey focused on variation in the financial incentives used across sites to ensure usual primary care services recruited patients to new providers.
   Results: We identified five over-arching areas of learning for implementing this large-scale programme: 1) managing new providers; 2) promoting awareness of services; 3) recruiting patients; 4) incentive payments; and 5) mechanisms for sharing learning. In general, tensions appeared to be caused by a lack of clear roles/responsibilities between hierarchical actors, and lack of communication. Both local sites and the national NHS coordination team gained experience through learning by doing. Initial tensions with roles and expectations have been worked out during implementation.
   Conclusions: Implementing a national disease prevention programme is a major task, and one that will be increasingly faced by health systems globally as they aim to adjust to demand pressures. We provide practical learning opportunities for the wider uptake and sustainability of prevention programmes. Future implementers might wish to define clear responsibilities for each actor prior to implementation, ensure early engagement with new providers, offer mechanisms/forums for sharing learning, generate evidence and provide advice on incentive payments, and prioritise public and professional awareness of the programme.

AB Background Trachoma is the commonest infectious cause of blindness. It is prevalent in areas where personal and community hygiene is poor, and it mainly affects deprived and marginalized communities most importantly in Ethiopia. Hence, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and associated factors of active trachoma among children in Ethiopia. Method A systematic review and meta-analysis was employed to determine the prevalence of active trachoma and associated factors among children in Ethiopia. We searched databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, EMBASE and Cochrane Library. To estimate the prevalence, studies reporting the prevalence of active trachoma and its associated factors were included. Data were extracted using a standardized data extraction format prepared in Microsoft excel and the analysis was done using STATA 14 statistical software. To assess heterogeneity, the Cochrane Q test statistics and I-2 test were used. Since the included studies revealed considerable heterogeneity, a random effect meta- analysis model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of active trachoma. Moreover, the association between factors and active trachoma were examined. Results The result of 30 eligible studies showed that the overall prevalence of active trachoma among children in Ethiopia was 26.9% (95% CI: 22.7, 31.0%). In the subgroup analysis, while the highest prevalence was reported in SNNP (35.8%; 95% CI: 22.7, 48.8), the lowest prevalence was reported in Oromia region (20.2%; 95% CI: 12.2, 28.2). Absence of latrine: OR 6.0 (95% CI 2.0, 17.5), the unclean faces of children: OR 5.5 (95% CI 2.8, 10.9), and no reported use of soap for washing: OR 3.3 (95% CI 1.8, 6.0) have shown a positive association with active trachoma among children. Conclusion From this review, it has been concluded that active trachoma among children is still a public health problem in different districts of Ethiopia. The prevalence of almost all studies are significantly higher than WHO target for elimination. Absence of latrine, unclean faces of children, no reported use of soap for washing are the important factors associated with active trachoma among children.

AB Background Cholera is a major public health concern in displaced-person camps, which often contend with overcrowding and scarcity of resources. Maela, the largest and longest-standing refugee camp in Thailand, located along the Thai-Burmese border, experienced four cholera outbreaks between 2005 and 2010. In 2013, a cholera vaccine campaign was implemented in the camp. To assist in the evaluation of the campaign and planning for subsequent campaigns, we developed a mathematical model of cholera in Maela. Methods We formulated a Susceptible-Infectious-Water-Recovered-based transmission model and estimated parameters using incidence data from 2010. We next evaluated the reduction in cases conferred by several immunization strategies, varying timing, effectiveness, and resources (i.e., vaccine availability). After the vaccine campaign, we generated case forecasts for the next year, to inform on-the-ground decision-making regarding whether a booster campaign was needed. Results We found that preexposure vaccination can substantially reduce the risk of cholera even when % of the population is given the full two-dose series. Additionally, the preferred number of doses per person should be considered in the context of one vs. two dose effectiveness and vaccine availability. For reactive vaccination, a trade-off between timing and effectiveness was revealed, indicating that it may be beneficial to give one dose to more people rather than two doses to fewer people, given that a two-dose schedule would incur a delay in administration of the second dose. Forecasting using realistic coverage levels predicted that there was no need for a booster campaign in 2014 (consistent with our predictions, there was not a cholera epidemic in 2014). Conclusions Our analyses suggest that vaccination in conjunction with ongoing water sanitation and hygiene efforts provides an effective strategy for controlling cholera outbreaks in refugee camps. Effective preexposure vaccination depends on timing and effectiveness. If a camp is facing an outbreak, delayed distribution of vaccines can substantially alter the effectiveness of reactive vaccination, suggesting that quick distribution of vaccines may be more important than ensuring every individual receives both vaccine doses. Overall, this analysis illustrates how mathematical models can be applied in public health practice, to assist in evaluating alternative intervention strategies and inform decision-making.

AB Background Tuberculosis (TB) makes a big challenge to public health, especially in high TB burden counties of China and Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). The aim of this study was to identify the spatial-temporal dynamic process and high-risk region of notified pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), sputum smear-positive tuberculosis (SSP-TB) and sputum smear-negative tuberculosis (SSN-TB) cases in Yunnan, the south-western of China between years of 2005 to 2018. Meanwhile, to evaluate the similarity of prevalence pattern for TB among GMS. Methods Data for notified PTB were extracted from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP) correspond to population information in 129 counties of Yunnan between 2005 to 2018. Seasonally adjusted time series defined the trend cycle and seasonality of PTB prevalence. Kulldorff's space-time scan statistics was applied to identify temporal, spatial and spatial-temporal PTB prevalence clusters at county-level of Yunnan. Pearson correlation coefficient and hierarchical clustering were applied to define the similarity of TB prevalence among borders with GMS. Result There were a total of 381,855 notified PTB cases in Yunnan, and the average prevalence was 59.1 per 100,000 population between 2005 to 2018. A declined long-term trend with seasonality of a peak in spring and a trough in winter for PTB was observed. Spatial-temporal scan statistics detected the significant clusters of PTB prevalence, the most likely cluster concentrated in the northeastern angle of Yunnan between 2011 to 2015 (RR = 2.6, P < 0.01), though the most recent cluster for PTB and spatial cluster for SSP-TB was in borders with GMS. There were six potential TB prevalence patterns among GMS. Conclusion This study detected aggregated time interval and regions for PTB, SSP-TB, and SSN-TB at county-level of Yunnan province. Similarity prevalence pattern was found in borders and GMS. The localized prevention strategy should focus on cross-boundary transmission and SSN-TB control.

TI Poor nutrition for under-five children from poor households in Ethiopia:
   Evidence from 2016 Demographic and Health Survey
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MALNUTRITION
AB Background
   Ethiopia is commonly affected by drought and famine, and this has taken quite a toll on citizens of the country, particularly the under-five children. Undernutrition among under-five children in Ethiopia is a prominent public health concern, and it lacked attention for decades. However, the government of Ethiopia, together with other stakeholders, committed to overcoming the impact of malnutrition through the transformational plan. Here we show the magnitude of undernutrition among under-five children and the factors predicting the achievement of global nutrition targets set for 2025 at the World Health Assembly.
   Methods
   Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) 2016 was used for this study. A total of 9494 child-mother pairs were included in this analysis. The nutritional status indicators (Height-for-age, Weight-for-height and Weight-for-age) of children were measured and categorized based on the World Health Organization child growth standards. A multilevel logistic regression model adjusted for clusters and sampling weights were used to identify factors associated with stunting, underweight, and wasting. The independent variables were assessed by calculating the odds ratios with 95% confidence interval (CI).
   Result
   The prevalence of stunting was 38.3% (95% CI: 36.4% to 40.2%), under-weight 23.3% (95%CI: 21.9% to 24.9%) and wasting 10.1% (95%, CI: 9.1% to 11.2%). Sex of the child (male), children older than 24 months, recent experience of diarrhea, household wealth index (poorest), and administrative regions (Tigray, Amhara and developing regions) had a higher risk of undernutrition. On the other hand, children born from overweight mothers and educated mother (primary, secondary or higher) had a lower risk of undernutrition.
   Conclusion
   The burden of undernutrition is still considerably high in Ethiopia. Implimentation of strategies and policies that focus on improving the socioeconomic educatiional status of the community need to be sustained. Generally, actions targeted on factors contributing to undernutrition among under-five children demands immediate attention to achieve national and global nutrition target.

TI "Tremendous financial burden": Crowdfunding for organ transplantation
   costs in Canada
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Online crowdfunding platforms such as GoFundMe are used to raise funds for health-related expenses associated with medical conditions such as organ transplantation. By investigating crowdfunding in Canadian organ transplantation, this study aimed to increase understanding of the motivations and outcomes of organ transplantation crowdfunding. Canadian liver and kidney transplantation campaigns posted to GoFundMe between May 30 & 31 2018 were identified and after exclusion, 258 kidney and 171 liver campaigns were included in study. These campaigns were coded for: worthiness of the campaign recipient, requested financial and non-monetary contributions, how monetary donations would be spent, and comments on the Canadian health system, among others. Results suggest Canadian organ donors, transplant candidates, recipients, and their families and caregivers experience significant financial difficulties not addressed by the public health system. Living and medication costs, transportation and relocation expenses, and income loss were the expenses most commonly highlighted by campaigners. Liver campaigns raised nearly half their goal while kidney campaigns received 11.5% of their requested amount. Findings highlight disease burden and the use of crowdfunding as a response to the extraordinary costs associated with organ transplantation. Although crowdfunding reduces some financial burden, it does not do so equitably and raises ethical concerns.

TI Birth asphyxia and its associated factors among newborns in public
   hospital, northeast Amhara, Ethiopia
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   Birth asphyxia is a leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality in developing nations, such as Ethiopia. Though Ethiopia has made considerable achievement in the reduction of under-five mortality rate, the neonatal mortality burden has not experienced the same reduction, which may be attributed to birth asphyxia. Thus, this study attempts to assess the prevalence and associated factors of birth asphyxia among newborns in public hospitals in the northeastern Amhara region, Ethiopia.
   Methods
   An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 357 births from 1st April to 2nd May 2018. The sample size was proportionally allocated to randomly selected three public hospitals namely, Dessie referral hospital, Debre Berhan referral hospital, and Woldia general hospital. The allocation was made by taking the average number of deliveries given in each hospital six months before the data collection period. Using the delivery registration of hospitals a systematic random sampling technique was used to get all study participants. The diagnosis of birth asphyxia was confirmed based on the physician's diagnosis of an APGAR score < 7 in the 1st and 5th minutes of birth. A pretested and structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Variables with p-values < 0.25 in the bivariable analysis were entered into a multivariable logistic regression analysis. A statistical significant level was declared at a p-value of < 0.05.
   Results
   The prevalence of birth asphyxia was found to occur 22.6% of the time [95% CI 19.2% - 26.4%] in the first minute of birth. In the multivariable logistic regression being primipara [AOR = 3.77: 95% CI 1.86, 7.65], presented with complicated labor [AOR = 3.45: 95% CI 1.58, 7.49], premature rupture of membrane [AOR = 3.85: 95% CI 1.76, 8.44) and having blood-stained amniotic fluid at birth [AOR = 5.02: 95% CI 1.69, 14.87] were the independent predictors of birth asphyxia.
   Conclusion
   The study revealed that birth asphyxia is a common newborn complication in the Amhara region. Integrated mitigation measure to reduce neonatal mortality in the Amahar region should give due attention to primipara women and for these high-risk pregnancies in order for the region to achieve national and global commitment to have sustainable change in women and neonatal health.

TI Does educational level predict hearing aid self-efficacy in experienced
   older adult hearing aid users from Latin America? Validation process of
   the Spanish version of the MARS-HA questionnaire
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID DETERMINANTS; IMPAIRMENT; HEALTH; CARE
AB Hearing aids are the most common rehabilitation strategy for age-related hearing loss. However, 25% to 50% of older adults fitted with hearing aids do not wear them post-fitting. Hearing aid self-efficacy has been suggested as one of the key factors that may explain adherence to hearing aids in older adults. The primary aim of this study was to determine a possible association between educational level and hearing aid self-efficacy in older adult hearing aid users from a Latin American country (i.e., Chile). The secondary aim was to determine if in this sample of older adults, hearing aid self-efficacy predicted hearing aid adherence as previously suggested by other studies. The MARS-HA (Measure of Audiologic Rehabilitation Self-Efficacy for Hearing Aids) questionnaire was used to measure hearing aid self-efficacy. This questionnaire was initially adapted into Spanish (S-MARS-HA) using forward and backward translations by bilingual English-Spanish speakers. A sample of 252 older adults fitted with hearing aids at a public hospital in Santiago, Chile, was investigated. Educational level was measured as the number of years of formal education. Participants responded to the S-MARS-HA along with questions exploring social support, attitudes in using hearing aids, participation in social events, and vision and joint problems. Hearing aid adherence was investigated with the use of a question from the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids. All these procedures were conducted at the participants' homes. Pure-tone average (PTA; 500-4000 Hz) in the fitted ear was obtained from the participants' medical records. Univariate and multivariate regression models were constructed to investigate the association between educational level and hearing aid self-efficacy controlling for the covariates of interest (e.g., social support, attitudes in using hearing aids, PTA). The SMARS-HA showed an adequate construct validity along with a good reliability. Results of the multivariate regression analyses showed that educational level significantly predicted hearing aid self-efficacy. Covariates significantly associated with this outcome included attitudes in using hearing aids and PTA in the fitted ear. Finally, a significant association between hearing aid self-efficacy and adherence to hearing aid use was observed. In conclusion, this study showed a significant association between educational level and hearing aid self-efficacy in older adults from a developing Latin American country. Thus, this variable should be considered when designing and delivering aural rehabilitation programs such as hearing aids to older adults, especially those from developing countries.

   Young people worldwide are often reticent to access family planning services from public health facilities: instead, they choose to get contraception from private, retail pharmacies. In Kenya, certain contraceptives are available in pharmacies: these include injectables, which can be dispensed but not administered, according national guidelines. However, Kenya struggles with enforcement of its pharmacy regulations and addressing illegal activity. Therefore, in this qualitative study, we assessed private pharmacies as an existing source of injectable contraception for young Kenyans (age 18-24), and investigated the perceived quality of service provision.
   Methods
   This study used: focus group discussions (6) with young community members; in-depth interviews (18) with youth who had purchased contraception from pharmacies; key informant interviews with pharmacy personnel and pharmacy stakeholders (25); and a mystery shopper (visiting 45 pharmacies).
   Results
   The study found that for injectable contraception, private pharmacies had expanded to service provision, and pharmacy personnel's roles had transcended formal or informal training previously received-young people could both purchase and be injected in many pharmacies. Pharmacies were perceived to lack consistent quality or strong regulation, resulting in young clients, pharmacy personnel, and regulators being concerned about illegal activity. Participants' suggestions to improve pharmacy service quality and regulation compliance focused on empowering consumers to demand quality service; strengthening regulatory mechanisms; expanding training opportunities to personnel in private pharmacies; and establishing a quality-based 'brand' for pharmacies.
   Discussion
   Kenya's recent commitments to universal health coverage and interest in revising pharmacy policy provide an opportunity to improve pharmacy quality. Multi-pronged initiatives with both public and private partners are needed to improve pharmacy practice, update and enforce regulations, and educate the public. Additionally, the advent of self-administrable injectables present a new possible role for pharmacies, and could offer young clients a clean, discreet place to self-inject, with pharmacy personnel serving as educators and dispensers.

AB Introduction
   Women with infertility have different experiences that determine the quality of their psychosocial health. Cultural constructions of infertility in Africa have made the experience of infertility among African women more burdensome. Yet, little is known about the psychosocial experiences of women with infertility in Zamfara State of Nigeria. The purpose of this study was to explore the psychosocial experiences of women with infertility in Zamfara.
   Materials and methods
   An exploratory qualitative design was used for this exploration. Individual in-depth interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide. Ethical approval was received from the Institutional Review Board of the Nogouchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research in the University of Ghana. Women who were married and seeking treatment for infertility from a public hospital were recruited and interviewed. A total of 12 women were interviewed with each interview lasting 45 minutes. The interviews were audiotaped with permission from the participants, transcribed verbatim, and content analysed.
   Results
   The findings revealed that psychologically, majority of the women had experienced anxiety, stress and depression as a result of their inability to get pregnant. Socially, the women suffered self and social isolation, social stigma, social pressure and marital problems.
   Conclusion
   These women have psychosocial health problems that need the attention of health professionals to enhance their wellbeing.

TI Challenges to generating political prioritization for adolescent sexual
   and reproductive health in Kenya: A qualitative study

AB Background
   Despite the high burden of adverse adolescent sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes, it has remained a low political priority in Kenya. We examined factors that have shaped the lack of current political prioritization of adolescent SRH service provision.
   Methods
   We used the Shiffman and Smith policy framework consisting of four categories-actor power, ideas, political contexts, and issue characteristics-to analyse factors that have shaped political prioritization of adolescent SRH. We undertook semi-structured interviews with 14 members of adolescent SRH networks between February and April 2019 at the national level and conducted thematic analysis of the interviews.
   Findings
   Several factors hinder the attainment of political priority for adolescent SRH in Kenya. On actor power, the adolescent SRH community was diverse and united in adoption of international norms and policies, but lacked policy entrepreneurs to provide strong leadership, and policy windows were often missed. Regarding ideas, community members lacked consensus on a cohesive public positioning of the problem. On issue characteristics, the perception of adolescents as lacking political power made politicians reluctant to act on the existing data on the severity of adolescent SRH. There was also a lack of consensus on the nature of interventions to be implemented. Pertaining to political contexts, sectoral funding by donors and government treasury brought about tension within the different government ministries resulting in siloed approaches, lack of coordination and overall inefficiency. However, the SRH community has several strengths that augur well for future political support. These include the diverse multi-sectoral background of its members, commitment to improving adolescent SRH, and the potential to link with other health priorities such as maternal health and HIV/AIDS.
   Conclusion
   In order to increase political attention to adolescent SRH in Kenya, there is an urgent need for policy actors to: 1) create a more cohesive community of advocates across sectors, 2) develop a clearer public positioning of adolescent SRH, 3) agree on a set of precise approaches that will resonate with the political system, and 4) identify and nurture policy entrepreneurs to facilitate the coupling of adolescent SRH with potential solutions when windows of opportunity arise.

TI Leishmania amazonensis resistance in murine macrophages: Analysis of
   possible mechanisms
SO PLOS ONE

   INFECTION; SUSCEPTIBILITY; ARGININE; PROTECTION; TRANSPORT; ARGINASE
AB Leishmaniasis encompass a group of infectious parasitic diseases occurring in 97 endemic countries where over one billion people live in areas at risk of infection. It is in the World Health Organization list of neglected diseases and it is considered a serious public health problem, with more than 20,000 deaths a year and high morbidity. Infection by protozoa from the genus Leishmania can cause several forms of the disease, which may vary from a self-healing ulcer to fatal visceral infection. Leishmania species, as well as host immune response and genetics can modulate the course of the disease. Leishmania sp are obligatory intracellular parasites that have macrophages as their main host cell. Depending on the activation phenotype, these cells may have distinct roles in disease development, acting in parasite control or proliferation. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to analyze Leishmania amazonensis infection in primary macrophage cells obtained from mice with two distinct genetic backgrounds, ie. different susceptibility to the infection; evaluating the cause for that difference. After infection, peritoneal macrophages from the resistant C3H/He strain presented lower parasite load when compared to susceptible BALB/c macrophages. The same was also true when cells received a Th2 stimulus after infection, but the difference was abrogated under Th1 stimulus. Nitric oxide production and arginase activity was different between the strains under Th1 or Th2 stimulus, respectively, but iNOS inhibition was unable to suppress C3H/He resistance. Hydrogen peroxide production was also higher in C3H/He than BALB/c under Th1 stimulus, but it could not account for differences in susceptibility. These results led us to conclude that, although they have an important role in parasite control, neither NO nor H2O2 production can explain C3H/He resistance to infection. Other studies are needed to uncover different mechanisms of resistance/susceptibility to L. amazonensis.

TI Neurofilaments in blood is a new promising preclinical biomarker for the
   screening of natural scrapie in sheep
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID LIGHT-CHAIN; DIAGNOSIS; DEMENTIA; DISEASE; CSF
AB Scrapie is a fatal neurodegenerative disease of sheep and goats belonging to the group of Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy or prion diseases. The EU has adopted mandatory measures for scrapie surveillance to safeguard public and animal health because it is highly contagious and might decimate all genetic susceptible animals in affected flocks. Definite diagnosis of scrapie relies on the detection of the pathological prion protein in brain tissues and there are still no blood biomarkers available for making diagnosis in living animals that can be used for the screening of sheep in scrapie-affected flocks. Neurofilament light (NfL) protein, a valid biomarker for neuronal and axonal damages, can now be easily measured in blood by the ultra-sensitive single molecule array (Simoa) technology. Recent work reported that serum NfL is increased in neurodegenerative diseases, including human prion diseases, but no data are available for scrapie or other animal prion diseases. Here, we found that the median serum NfL concentration in scrapie animals (56.2, IQR 42.2-84.8, n = 9) was more than 15 times higher (p = 0.00084) than that found in control samples (3.4, IQR 3.0-26.3, n = 11). Moreover, serum NfL concentration in scrapie sheep with clinical signs (n = 2; 75.3, 15.7 pg/ml) did not significantly (p = 0.541; t-test) differ from scrapie animals without clinical signs (n = 7; 61.0, 10.7 pg/ml). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis estimated the cut-off value of 31 pg/ml serum NfL for distinguishing scrapie-infected sheep from controls. The application of this cut-off value gives an accuracy of the test of 95% (percent error of 5.23%). These data indicate that the Simoa test for serum NfL might be a useful screening method for detecting preclinical scrapie in living sheep. Finally, the preliminary data reported here need confirmation in large and more structured studies.

AB Background: Increasing evidence suggests that psychological well-being (PWB) is associated with lower disease and mortality risk, and may be enhanced with relatively low-cost interventions. Yet, dissemination of these interventions remains limited, in part because insufficient attention has been paid to distinct PWB dimensions, which may impact physical health outcomes differently.
   Methods: This essay first reviews the empirical evidence regarding differential relationships between all-cause mortality and multiple dimensions of PWB (e.g., life purpose, mastery, positive affect, life satisfaction, optimism). Then, individual-level positive psychology interventions aimed at increasing PWB and tested in randomized-controlled trials are reviewed as these allow for easy implementation and potentially broad outreach to improve population well-being, in concert with efforts targeting other established social determinants of health.
   Results: Several PWB dimensions relate to mortality, with varying strength of evidence. Many of positive psychology trials indicate small-to-moderate improvements in PWB; rigorous institution-level interventions are comparatively few, but preliminary results suggest benefits as well. Examples of existing health policies geared towards the improvement of population well-being are also presented. Future avenues of well-being epidemiological and intervention research, as well as policy implications, are discussed.
   Conclusions: Although research in the fields of behavioral and psychosomatic medicine, as well as health psychology have substantially contributed to the science of PWB, this body of work has been somewhat overlooked by the public health community. Yet, the growing interest in documenting well-being, in addition to examining its determinants and consequences at a population level may provoke a shift in perspective. To cultivate optimal well-being-mental, physical, social, and spiritual-consideration of a broader set of well-being measures, rigorous studies, and interventions that can be disseminated is critically needed.

AB Background: HIV, HBV and HCV remain a global public health concern especially in Africa. Prevalence of these infections is changing and identification of risk factors associated with each infection in Mali is needed to improve medical care.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of all individuals donating blood (n = 8207) in 2018 to the blood bank at university hospital in Bamako, Mali, to assess prevalence and risks factors associated with HIV, HBV, HCV and syphilis infections.
   Results: HIV-seroprevalence was 2.16% and significantly increased with age, being married and decreasing education level. In multivariate analysis, after adjustements with age, marital status and geographical setting, only education level was associated with HIV-infection (OR, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.15-2.07], p = 0.016). HBsAg prevalence was 14.78% and significantly increased with to be male gender. In multivariate analysis, adjusting for age, marital status and type of blood donation, education level (OR, 1.17 [95%CI, 1.05-1.31], p = 0.02) and male gender (OR, 1.37 [95%CI, 1.14-1.65], p = 0.005) were associated with HBV-infection. HCV-prevalence was 2.32% and significantly increased with living outside Bamako. In multivariate analysis, adjusting for gender, age and education level, living outside Bamako was associated with HCV-infection (OR, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.41-2.35], p < 0.001). Syphilis seroprevalence was very low (0.04%) with only 3 individuals infected. Contrary to a prior study, blood donation type was not, after adjustments, an independent risk factor for each infection.
   Conclusions: Overall, HIV and HBV infection was higher in individuals with a lower level of education, HBV infection was higher in men, and HCV infection was higher in people living outside of Bamako. Compared to studies performed in 1999, 2002 and 2007 in the same population, we found that HIV and HCV prevalence have decreased in the last two decades whereas HBV prevalence has remained stable. Our finding will help guide infection prevention and treatment programs in Mali.

AB Background: Tuberculosis represents a serious public health problem and a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge worldwide. Molecular diagnostic techniques are crucial in the World Health Organization's new tuberculosis control strategy. This study aims to evaluate the performance of GeneXpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid Sunnyvale, CA, United States) in diagnosis of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis then compare it's performance in detecting Rifampicin resistance to GenoType MTBDRplus (HAIN Life Sciences, Nehren, Germany).
   Methods: Samples from pulmonary and/or extra-pulmonary origins were analysed in a 21 months retrospective study. Samples were sent to the bacteriology laboratory for Mycobacterium tuberculosis detection using conventional bacteriological and molecular methods (GeneXpert MTB/RIF and MTBDRplus). Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for the stained smear and GeneXpert according to culture (Gold Standard) as well as for GeneXpert MTB/RIF in both negative and positive microscopy tuberculosis cases. Data's statistical analysis was performed with SPSS13.0 software.
   Results: Seven hundred fourteen patients' samples were analysed; the average age was 47.21 +/- 19.98 years with a male predominance (66.4%). Out of 714 samples: 285 were from pulmonary and 429 were from extra-pulmonary origins. The positivity rates for microscopy, GeneXpert MTB/RIF and culture were 12.88, 20.59 and 15.82%, respectively. These rates were 18.9, 23.85 and 20.35% for pulmonary samples and 9.71, 18.41 and 12.82% for extra-pulmonary samples, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of GeneXpert MTB/RIF were almost the same in both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary samples (78.2 and 90.4%) and (79,3 and 90.3%) respectively. Rifampicin resistance rate found by GeneXpert MTB/RIF was 0.84%. Comparison of Rifampicin resistance obtained by GeneXpert MTB/RIF and Genotype MTBDRplus, showed 100% agreement between the two techniques for studied samples.
   Conclusions: This confirms GeneXpert MTB/RIF advantage for tuberculosis diagnosis, particularly extra-pulmonary tuberculosis with negatively stained smear. The performance of GeneXpert and Genotype MTBDRplus are similar in detection of Rifampicin resistance. However, variability of detection performance according to tuberculosis endemicity deserves more attention in the choice of screening techniques of Rifampicin resistance, hence the interest of conducting comparative studies of detection performance under low and medium endemicity on large samples of tuberculosis populations.

AB Background: Although vaccination of pregnant women against influenza is recommended, the vaccination rate remains low. We conducted a study to identify determinants of influenza vaccination uptake in pregnancy in order to identify strategies to improve seasonal influenza vaccination rates.
   Methods: Prospective observational hospital-based study in the French hospital performing the highest number of deliveries, located in the city of Lille, among all women who had given birth during the 2014-2015 influenza season. Data were collected through a self-completed questionnaire and from medical files. The vaccination uptake was self-reported. Determinants of vaccination uptake were identified using logistic regression analysis.
   Results: Of the 2045 women included in the study, 35.5% reported that they had been vaccinated against influenza during their pregnancy. The principal factors significantly associated with greater vaccination uptake were previous influenza vaccination (50.9% vs 20.2%, OR 4.1, 95% CI 3.1-5.5), nulliparity (41.0% vs 31.3%, OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.7-3.7), history of preterm delivery < 34 weeks (43.4% vs 30.3%, OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-4.9), the mother's perception that the frequency of vaccine complications for babies is very low (54.6% vs 20.6%, OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.5-2.2), the mother's good knowledge of influenza and its vaccine (61.7% vs 24.4%, OR 3.1, 95% CI 2.2-4.4), hospital-based prenatal care in their first trimester of pregnancy (55.0% vs 30.2%, OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.2-3.7), vaccination recommendations during pregnancy by a healthcare worker (47.0% vs 2.7%, OR 18.8, 95% CI 10.0-35.8), receipt of a vaccine reimbursement form (52.4% vs 18.6%, OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.5-2.7), and information from at least one healthcare worker about the vaccine (43.8% vs 19.1%, OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3-2.6).
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that in order to increase flu vaccination compliance among pregnant women, future public health programmes must ensure cost-free access to vaccination, and incorporate education about the risks of influenza and the efficacy/safety of vaccination and clear recommendations from healthcare professionals into routine antenatal care.

   WORKING
AB Background
   People living with a Serious Mental Illness (SMI) die earlier than the general population due to preventable medical conditions. Latinos living with SMI are a particularly vulnerable population with higher prevalence of chronic medical conditions. Stigma has been identified as a factor that fosters health inequities for Latinos/as with SMI, particularly Puerto Ricans. Although personal and social consequences of stigmatization have been well documented, research regarding the role of cultural factors on healthcare interactions is scarce. Furthermore, little research has focused on addressing stigma from the perspective of healthcare professionals.
   Methods
   We investigated this process through a qualitative design using semi-structured individual interviews with 11 healthcare professionals (8 physicians and 3 nurses) in Puerto Rico. We conducted a thematic analysis to analyze the data.
   Results
   Following a thematic analysis, we found three main themes and nine sub-themes related to the stigmatization process. Some participants reported perceptions of dangerousness and uneasiness, social distance and inadequate care. Participants also emphasized a lack of medical training regarding SMI within the Puerto Rican context.
   Conclusions
   These findings support the need to develop culturally appropriate public health interventions targeting healthcare professionals in order to address stigma and eliminate health disparities among Latinos/as with SMI.

AB Background: Mouse and human studies support the promise of dry beans to improve metabolic health and to lower cancer risk. In overweight/obese patients with a history of colorectal polyps or cancer, the Beans to Enrich the Gut microbiome vs. Obesity's Negative Effects (BE GONE) trial will test whether and how an increase in the consumption of pre-cooked, canned dry beans within the context of usual diet and lifestyle can enhance the gut landscape to improve metabolic health and reduce cancer risk.
   Methods/design: This randomized crossover trial is designed to characterize changes in (1) host markers spanning lipid metabolism, inflammation, and obesity-related cancer risk; (2) compositional and functional profiles of the fecal microbiome; and (3) host and microbial metabolites. With each subject serving as their own control, the trial will compare the participant's usual diet with (intervention) and without (control) dry beans. Canned, pre-cooked dry beans are provided to participants and the usual diet continually assessed and monitored. Following a 4-week run-in and equilibration period, each participant provides a total of 5 fasting blood and 6 stool samples over a total period of 16 weeks. The intervention consists of a 2-week ramp-up of dry bean intake to 1 cup/d, which is then continued for an additional 6 weeks. Intra- and inter-individual outcomes are assessed across each crossover period with consideration of the joint or modifying effects of the usual diet and baseline microbiome.
   Discussion: The BE GONE trial is evaluating a scalable dietary prevention strategy targeting the gut microbiome of high-risk patients to mitigate the metabolic and inflammatory effects of adiposity that influence colorectal cancer risk, recurrence, and survival. The overarching scientific goal is to further elucidate interactions between diet, the gut microbiome, and host metabolism. Improved understanding of the diet-microbiota interplay and effective means to target these relationships will be key to the future of clinical and public health approaches to cancer and other major diet- and obesity-related diseases.

AB Background: Vitamin A deficiency is known for its adverse health consequences, such as blindness, growth retardation and death. To curb the problem, Ethiopia has implemented various public health measures although little has been done to examine the deficiency among pregnant and lactating women. As a result, this study assessed the prevalence of Vitamin A deficiency and associated factors among pregnant and lactating women in Lay Armachiho district, northwest Ethiopia.
   Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted on pregnant and lactating women in Lay Arimachiho district, northwest Ethiopia, using the multistage systematic sampling technique to select participants. The binary logistic regression model was fitted to test the effect of exposure variables, and the Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) and p-value < 0.05 were computed to identify the significance and the strength of the associations of variables with Vitamin A deficiency.
   Results: The study revealed that 13.7% of the pregnant and lactating women had night blindness and 0.4% had also Bitot's Spot. Over 35 years of age of mothers (AOR = 2.74; 95%CI: 1.15,7.43), less than USD 22.7 household monthly income (AOR = 8.9; 95%CI: 4.54,21.73), and poor hand washing practices after toilets (AOR = 8.87; 95% CI: 4.43,18.68) were positively associated with VAD, while mothers' access to the media (AOR = 0.20; 95%CI:0.07, 0.59), formal education (AOR = 0.09; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.41), over 18 years of age at first marriage (AOR = 0.19; 95%CI: 0.08,0.36), and no fasting (AOR = 0.14; 95%CI: 0.04,0.46) were negatively associated.
   Conclusions: Maternal Vitamin A deficiency was the major public health problem in Lay Armachiho district. Over 35 years of age of mothers, less than USD 22.7 household monthly income and poor hand washing practices after toilets were high risks for VAD, while mothers' access to the media, formal education, over 18 years at first marriage, and no fasting were low risks. Therefore, community awareness about the risk of early marriage, poor hand hygiene practices after toilets, and fasting during pregnancy and lactating period were essential. Organizations working on maternal health need to focus on mothers with low incomes in order to reduce their deficiency in Vitamin A.

AB Background: Salmonella is one of the most important foodborne pathogens, causing outbreaks of human salmonellosis worldwide. Owing to large scales of consumption markets, pork and poultry that contaminated by Salmonella could pose a tremendous threat to public health. The aim of this study was to investigate the contamination of Salmonella from chicken, pork and the environment in slaughtering and retail processes in Chongqing, China.
   Results: A total of 115 Salmonella isolates were recovered from 1112 samples collected from pork, chicken and the environment. Compared with the isolation rate of samples from chicken (9.50%) and the environment (6.23%), samples from pork had a significant higher isolation rate (44.00%). The isolation rates in slaughterhouses (10.76%) and in supermarkets (10.07%) showed no statistical difference. Thirty different serotypes were identified among all the isolates. S. Derby (n = 26), S. London (n = 16) and S. Rissen (n = 12) were the dominant serotypes. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that 73.04% isolates were resistant to tetracycline, followed by 66.96% to ampicillin and 59.13% to doxycycline. More than half (50.43%) of the isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR), and most of the MDR isolates were from supermarkets. Multilocus sequence typing results showed 24 out of 115 isolates were ST40, which was the most prevalent. Furthermore, isolates from supermarkets had 20 different sequence types while isolates from slaughterhouses only had 8 different sequence types.
   Conclusion: Our study highlighted that Salmonella was more frequently isolated in pork production chain than that in chicken. Compared with isolates from slaughterhouses, isolates from supermarkets had more MDR profiles and represented a wider range of serotypes and sequence types, indicating that the retail process had more diverse sources of Salmonella contamination than that of slaughtering process.

AB Background: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in Lebanon and Qatar. When lifestyle modifications prove insufficient, medication becomes a cornerstone in controlling such diseases and saving lives. Price, availability, and affordability hinder the equitable access to medicines. The study aimed to assess prices, availability, and affordability of essential cardiovascular disease medicines in relation to pricing strategies in Qatar and Lebanon.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey using a variant of the World Health Organization and Health Action International (WHO/HAI) methodology as outlined in "Measuring medicine prices, availability, affordability and price components" (2008), second edition, was adopted. Prices and availability of 27 cardiovascular medicines were collected from public and private dispensing outlets. For international comparison, prices were adjusted to purchasing power parity. Data was analyzed across multiple sectors, within and across countries.
   Results: A total of 15 public and private outlets were surveyed in each country. Prices were more uniform in Qatar than in Lebanon. In the public sector, medicines were free-of-charge in Lebanon and priced lower than the international reference prices in Qatar. The ratio of medicine unit price to international reference price in the private sectors surveyed are significantly higher than the acceptable threshold of 4. This ratio of originator brands and lowest priced generics in Qatar were up to two and five times those in Lebanon, respectively, even after adjusting for purchasing power parity. However, prices of lowest priced generics in the private sector were at least 35% cheaper in Qatar and 65% cheaper in Lebanon than their comparative originator brands. Medicines were more available in the private sector in Lebanon than in Qatar, but only the originator brand availability in the public sector in Qatar exceeded the WHO target of more than 80%. While affordable in the public sector in Qatar, four out of thirteen medicines exceeded the threshold in all private sectors covered. Hence, only the public sector in Qatar had a satisfying level of availability and affordability.
   Conclusions: Except for the Qatari public sector, medicine prices, availability, and affordability are falling short from targets. Key policy decisions should be implemented to improve access to medicines.

AB BackgroundCardiovascular disease has become a serious public health problem in recent years in China. The aim of the study was to examine sex differences in cardiovascular risk factors and 10-year ischemic cardiovascular disease (ICVD) risk in Chinese patients with prediabetes (PreDM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).MethodsThis was a multi-site retrospective case-control study conducted from April-November 2016 using an electronic medical record database, involving 217 PreDM and 900 T2DM patients admitted to endocrinology units in four hospitals in China. CVD risk was estimated using the Chinese 10-year ICVD risk model. The differences in 10-year absolute ICVD risk according to PreDM, T2DM <1year, T2DM 1-5years or T2DM <greater than or equal to>5years and sex were analyzed using ANOVA.ResultsWhen compared to PreDM females, males with PreDM had significantly higher 10-year ICVD risk In contrast, the opposite pattern of 10-year ICVD risk was observed in T2DM; males had significantly lower 10-year ICVD risk. Moreover, compared to T2DM females, males with T2DM had a lower proportion s with moderate or greater ICVD risk (p<0.001). When compared to PreDM males, males with T2DM <1year, and with T2DM 1-5years had no difference in 10-year ICVD risk, but had higher ICVD risk with T2DM >= 5years (p<0.05). Compared to PreDM females, females with T2DM in all subgroups had higher ICVD risk (p<0.05). Among those with T2DM, hypertension rates of awareness, treatment and control were 78.60%, 65.38% and 31.10%, respectively; hyperlipidemia rates of awareness, treatment and control were lower (29.15%, 8.30% and 3.47%, respectively). Females with T2DM had higher prevalence, awareness and treatment of hypertension and hyperlipidemia than males with T2DM (p<0.001).ConclusionsThere is a greater need for cardiovascular risk reduction programs for females with T2DM at diagnosis. Given the low numbers for awareness, treatment and control of hypertension and hyperlipidemia in both males and females, significant resources focused on them must be expended, specifically improving regular assessment of blood pressure and blood lipids. Strengthening the management of chronic diseases through adherence to evidence-based guidelines to enhance clinical treatment may reduce 10-year ICVD in patients with T2DM in China.

TI Use of detailed family history data to improve risk prediction,with
   application to breast cancer screening
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID WOMEN
AB Background
   As breast cancer represents a major morbidity and mortality burden in the U.S., with about one in eight women developing invasive breast cancer over her lifetime, accurate low-cost screening is an important public health issue. First-degree family history, often simplified as a dichotomous or three-level categorical variable (0/1/> 1) based on number of affected relatives, is an important risk factor for many conditions. However, detailed family structure information such as the total number of first-degree relatives, and for each, their current or death age, and age at diagnosis are also important for risk prediction.
   Methods
   We develop a family history score under a Bayesian framework, based on first-degree family structure. We tested performance of the proposed score using data from a large prospective cohort study of women with a first-degree breast cancer family history. We used likelihood ratio tests to evaluate whether the proposed score added additional information to a Cox model with known breast cancer risk factors and the three-level family history variable. We also compared prediction performance through Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and goodness-of-fit testing.
   Results
   Our proposed Bayesian family history score improved fit compared to the commonly used three-level family history score, both without and with adjustment for other risk factors (likelihood ratio tests p = 0.003 without adjustment for other risk factors, and p = 0.007 and 0.009 under adjustment with two candidate sets of risk factors). AUCs of ROC curves for the two models were similar, though in all cases were higher after addition of the BFHS.
   Conclusions
   Capturing detailed family history data through the proposed family history score can improve risk assessment and prediction. Such approaches could enable better-targeted personalized screening schedules and prevention strategies.

AB Background: Work-related musculoskeletal pain is a major cause of work disability and sickness absence. While pain is a multifactorial phenomenon being influenced by work as well as lifestyle, less is known about the association between specific lifestyle factors and the type of musculoskeletal pain. The aim of the study was to investigate if a dose-response association existed between lifestyle factors and musculoskeletal pain intensity in the low back and neck-shoulder.
   Methods: Currently employed wage earners (N = 10,427) replied in 2010 to questions about work environment, lifestyle and health. Logistic regression analyses adjusted for various confounders tested the association of alcohol intake, physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, and smoking (explanatory variables) with low back pain and neck-shoulder pain intensity (outcomes variables, scale 0-9, where >= 4 is high pain).
   Results: The minimally adjusted model found that physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake were associated with lower risk of musculoskeletal pain, while smoking was associated with higher risk of musculoskeletal pain. In the fully adjusted model, physical activity >= 5 h per week was associated with lower risk of low back pain and neck-shoulder pain with risk ratios (RR) of 0.95 (95% CI 0.90-1.00) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.82-0.99), respectively. No association was found between alcohol intake and pain.
   Conclusion: Being physically active associated with lower risk of having musculoskeletal pain, while smoking habits and healthy eating were associated with higher pain when adjusting for age and gender. Considering the continuously increasing retirement age in many societies, initiatives to promote healthy habits should still be a political priority to help the workers to stay healthy and cope to their work.

An umbrella review of systematic reviews was conducted to identify the evidence for the health and health inequalities impact of population level macroeconomic factors, strategies, policies and interventions.
   Methods: Nine databases were searched for systematic reviews meeting the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) criteria using a novel conceptual framework. Studies were assessed for quality using a standardised instrument and a narrative overview of the findings is presented.
   Results: The review found a large (n = 62) but low quality systematic review-level evidence base. The results indicated that action to promote employment and improve working conditions can help improve health and reduce gender-based health inequalities. Evidence suggests that market regulation of tobacco, alcohol and food is likely to be effective at improving health and reducing inequalities in health including strong taxation, or restriction of advertising and availability. Privatisation of utilities and alcohol sectors, income inequality, and economic crises are likely to increase health inequalities. Left of centre governments and welfare state generosity may have a positive health impact, but evidence on specific welfare interventions is mixed. Trade and trade policies were found to have a mixed effect. There were no systematic reviews of the health impact of monetary policy or of large economic institutions such as central banks and regulatory organisations.
   Conclusions: The results of this study provide a simple yet comprehensive framework to support policy-makers and practitioners in addressing the macroeconomic determinants of health. Further research is needed in low and middle income countries and further reviews are needed to summarise evidence in key gaps identified by this review.

AB Background: Stunted growth in early infancy is a public health problem in low-and-middle income countries. Evidence suggests heavy agricultural work during pregnancy is inversely associated with maternal body mass index (BMI) and infant birth weight in low- and middle-income countries; but pathways linking agricultural work to length-for-age Z-scores (LAZ) in early infancy have not been examined. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between agricultural work during pregnancy, post-natal maternal BMI and LAZ among young infants in rural Pakistan; and explored whether maternal BMI mediated the relationship between agricultural work and infant LAZ.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from December 2015 to January 2016 in rural Sindh, Pakistan. Mother-infant dyads were recruited via systematic random cluster sampling at 2-12 weeks' post-partum (n = 1161). Anthropometric measurements (maternal and infant height/length and weight) and questionnaire data were collected. Multivariable linear regression and structural-equation based mediation analyses were used to examine associations of agricultural work during pregnancy with maternal BMI and infant LAZ.
   Results: During pregnancy, women reported engaging in livestock-related work (57.0%), crop-related work (42.7%), and cotton harvesting (28.4%). All three forms of agricultural work were negatively associated with maternal BMI (beta = - 0.67 [-1.06; - 0.28], beta = -0.97 [-1.51; -0.48]; and beta = -0.87 [-1.33; -0.45], respectively). Maternal engagement in cotton harvesting alone was negatively associated with infant LAZ after controlling for confounding factors. The total negative effect of cotton harvesting on infant LAZ was - 0.35 [-0.53; -0.16]. The indirect effect of maternal BMI on infant LAZ was -0.06 [-0.08; -0.03], revealing that 16% (- 0.06/-0.35) of the relationship between cotton harvesting and infant LAZ, after adjustment, was mediated via maternal BMI.
   Conclusion: These results underscore a need to reduce labour-intensive agricultural workload demands during pregnancy, especially in cotton harvesting, to reduce risks of negative maternal energy balance and poor growth outcomes in early infancy.

AB Background: Behaviour change interventions targeting physical activity, diet, sleep and sedentary behaviour of teenagers show promise when delivered through smartphones. However, to date there is no evidence of effectiveness of multicomponent smartphone-based interventions. Utilising a user-centred design approach, we developed a theory-based, multi-dimensional system, PEGASO Fit For Future (PEGASO F4F), which exploits sophisticated game mechanics involving smartphone applications, a smartphone game and activity sensors to motivate teenagers to take an active role in adopting and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. This paper describes the study protocol to assess the feasibility, usability and effectiveness (knowledge/awareness and behavioural change in lifestyle) of the PEGASO system.
   Methods: We are conducting a quasi-experimental controlled cluster trial in 4 sites in Spain, Italy, and UK (England, Scotland) over 6 months. We plan to recruit 525, in a 2:1 basis, teenagers aged 13-16 years from secondary schools. The intervention group is provided with the PEGASO system whereas the comparison group continues their usual educational routine. Outcomes include feasibility, acceptance, and usability of the PEGASO system as well as between and within group changes in motivation, self-reported diet, physical activity, sedentary and sleeping behaviour, anthropometric measures and knowledge about a healthy lifestyle.
   Discussion: PEGASO F4F will provide evidence into the cross-cultural similarities and differences in the feasibility, acceptability and usability of a multi-dimensional smartphone based behaviour change intervention for teenagers. The study will explore facilitating factors, challenges and barriers of engaging teenagers to adapt and maintain a healthy lifestyle when using smartphone technology. Positive results from this ICT based multi component intervention may have significant implications both at clinical level, improving teenagers health and at public health level since it can present an influential tool against the development of chronic disease during adulthood.

TI When risk becomes illness: The personal and social consequences of
   cervical intraepithelial neoplasia medical surveillance
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PAP-SMEAR; FOLLOW-UP; CANCER; WOMEN; HPV; INFORMATION; REASONS
AB Background
   After the early detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), medical surveillance of the precancerous lesions is carried out to control risk factors to avoid the development of cervical cancer.
   Objective
   To explore the effects of medical surveillance on the personal and social lives of women undergoing CIN follow-up and treatment.
   Methodology
   A generic qualitative study using a poststructuralist perspective of risk management was carried out in a gynecology clinic in a public hospital of the Galician Health Care System (Spain). Participants were selected through purposive sampling. The sample consisted of 21 women with a confirmed diagnosis of CIN. Semistructured interviews were recorded and transcribed, and a thematic analysis was carried out, including researcher triangulation to verify the results of the analysis.
   Findings
   Two main themes emerged from the participants' experiences: CIN medical surveillance encounters and risk management strategies are shaped by the biomedical discourse, and the effects of "risk treatment" for patients include (a) profound changes expected of patients, (b) increased patient risk management, and (c) resistance to risk management. While doctors' surveillance aimed to prevent the development of cervical cancer, women felt they were sick because they had to follow strict recommendations over an unspecified period of time and live with the possibility of a life-threatening disease. Clinical risk management resulted in the medicalization of women's personal and social lives and produced great uncertainty.
   Conclusions
   This study is the first to conceptualize CIN medical surveillance as an illness experience for patients. It also problematizes the effects of preventative practices in women's lives. Patients deal with great uncertainty, as CIN medical surveillance performed by gynecologists simultaneously trivializes the changes expected of patients and underestimates the effects of medical recommendations on patients' personal wellbeing and social relations.

AB Background: Bullying and suicidal behaviors are a silent public health problem among adolescents. Little is known about the link between bullying and suicidal behaviors in low-income countries such as Tanzania. In the current study, we estimated the prevalence of being bullied and determined its association with suicidal behaviors among in-school adolescents.
   Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of the Tanzania Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS) conducted in 2014. This was the first nationally representative survey conducted to a sample of 3793 in-school adolescents. The primary independent variable was being bullied, while the outcome variables of interest were suicide ideation and suicide attempt. We used a chi-square chi(2) test for group variables comparisons and multivariate logistic regression for statistical associations between independent and outcome variables. In our analysis, a p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant at 95% confidence intervals.
   Results: The prevalence of being bullied among 3793 surveyed in-school adolescents was 27.0%. In an adjusted multivariate regression model, being bullied was independently associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempt: [AOR; 1.9, 95% C.I; 1.5-2.4], and [AOR; 3.6, 95% C.I; 2.9-4.5] respectively, p < 0.001.
   Conclusions: Bullying is prevalent and possibly a potential predictor of suicidal behaviors among in-school adolescents in Tanzania. There is a need for all educational stakeholders: teachers, parents, students, mental health professionals, and policymakers to design a program for mitigating the problem of bullying in schools.

DT Article
DE Adverse childhood experiences; Gender; Depression; Young adults; Iraq
ID HOUSEHOLD DYSFUNCTION; HEALTH; ABUSE; STRESS; RISK
AB Background: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are considered as universal public health problem that associate with mental disorders and risky behaviors during adulthood. The aims of the paper are to estimate the prevalence of Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) among young adults in Iraq as well as to estimate the association between ACEs and depression.
   Methods: A convenience sample of young adults of 18-20 years was chosen from centre and west of Iraq, mainly from universities. The adverse childhood experiences were measured by Adverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire. A depression scale was derived from the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS). Statistical tests: chi square was used to measure the association between adverse childhood experiences and other variables like gender and depression. Odds ratios were computed to estimate the risk for depression. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
   Results: The total number of participants was 401, 38.9% of the subjects were men, while 61.1% were women. The mean age of the participants was 18.88 +/- 0.745. The results revealed that the most common forms of ACEs among the subjects were physical neglect (19.8%) and emotional neglect (19.2%) followed by physical abuse (17.21%) while sexual abuse was 7.52%.
   There was statistically significant association between most forms of adverse childhood experiences especially emotional abuse, emotional neglect, physical abuse and physical neglect with depression.
   Conclusion: ACEs are not uncommon among young adults in Iraq and are associated with depression in adulthood. National programmes to support mental health rehabilitation might be necessary to reduce the effect of ACEs among Iraqi people, especially for adolescents and young adults.

AB Background: Understanding the knowledge and beliefs of key stakeholders is crucial in developing effective public health interventions. Knowledge and beliefs about obesity and eating disorders (EDs) have rarely been considered, despite increasing awareness of the need for integrated health promotion programs. We investigated key aspects of knowledge and beliefs about obesity and EDs among key stakeholders in Australia.
   Methods: Using a semi-structured question guide, eight focus groups and seven individual interviews were conducted with 62 participants including health professionals, personal trainers, teachers and consumer group representatives. An inductive thematic approach was used for data analysis.
   Results: The findings suggest that, relative to obesity, EDs are poorly understood among teachers, personal trainers, and certain health professionals. Areas of commonality and distinction between the two conditions were identified. Integrated health promotion efforts that focus on shared risk (e.g., low self-esteem, body dissatisfaction) and protective (e.g., healthy eating, regular exercise) factors were supported. Suggested target groups for such efforts included young children, adolescents and parents.
   Conclusions: The findings indicate areas where the EDs and obesity fields have common ground and can work together in developing integrated health promotion programs.

AB The purpose of this correspondence is to express our disappointment with the coverage of the BMC Public Health supplement: Vol 19 (4) titled "Health and Nutritional Issues Among Low Income Population in Malaysia", which neglected to include the fundamental health and nutrition issues that are adversely affecting the lives and livelihood of the indigenous peoples. The Supplement comprised 21 papers. Two of these papers included indigenous peoples as study subjects. These two papers addressed peripheral, albeit important health issues, namely visual impairment and quality of life, and not the persistent and rising health concerns impacting this population. We will provide evidence from research and reports to justify our critique that the Supplement missed the opportunity to spotlight on the serious extent of the health and nutritional deprivations of the indigenous peoples of Malaysia. As researchers of the indigenous peoples, we ought to lend our voice to the "silenced minority" by highlighting their plight in the media including scientific journals.

DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; PREVENTING SEVERE; INFECTION; METAANALYSIS; ILLNESS;
   BURDEN; ADULTS
AB Background: All aged individuals with a chronic condition and those with 65 and more years are at increased risk of severe influenza post-infection complications. There is limited research on cases averted by the yearly vaccination programs in high-risk individuals. The objective was to estimate the impact of trivalent seasonal influenza vaccination on averted hospitalizations and death among the high-risk population in Portugal.
   Methods: The impact of trivalent seasonal influenza vaccination was estimated using vaccine coverage, vaccine effectiveness and the number of influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths. The number of averted events (NAE), prevented fraction (PF) and number needed to vaccinate (NVN) were estimated for seasons 2014/15 to 2016/17.
   Results: The vaccination strategy averted on average approximately 1833 hospitalizations and 383 deaths per season. Highest NAE was observed in the >= 65 years population (85% of hospitalizations and 95% deaths) and in the 2016/17 season (1957 hospitalizations and 439 deaths). On average, seasonal vaccination prevented 21% of hospitalizations in the population aged 65 and more, and 18.5% in the population with chronic conditions. The vaccination also prevented 29% and 19.5% of deaths in each group of the high-risk population. It would be needed to vaccinate 3360 high-risk individuals, to prevent one hospitalization and 60,471 high-risk individuals to prevent one death.
   Conclusion: The yearly influenza vaccination campaigns had a sustained positive benefit for the high-risk population, reducing hospitalizations and deaths. These results can support public health plans toward increased vaccine coverage in high-risk groups.

AB Background: HIV remains a major public health challenge in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The initiation of a greater number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) onto antiretroviral therapy (ART) following the World Health Organization's `universal test and treat' recommendation has the potential to overstretch already challenged health systems in LMICs. While various mainstream and community-based care models have been implemented to improve the treatment outcomes of PLHIV, little effort has been made to harness the potential of the families or households of PLHIV to enhance their treatment outcomes. To this end, we sought to explore the characteristics and effectiveness of household-focused interventions in LMICs on the management of HIV as measured by levels of adherence, viral suppression and different dimensions of HIV competence. Additionally, we sought to explore the mechanisms of change to explain how the interventions achieved the expected outcomes.
   Methods: We systematically reviewed the literature published from 2003 to 2018, obtained from six electronic databases. We thematically analysed the 11 selected articles guided by the population, intervention, comparison and outcome (PICO) framework. Following the generative causality logic, whereby mechanisms are postulated to mediate an intervention and the outcomes, we applied a mechanism-based inferential reasoning, retroduction, to identify the mechanisms underlying the interventions to understand how these interventions are expected to work.
   Results: The identified HIV-related interventions with a household focus were multi-component and multidimensional, incorporating aspects of information sharing on HIV; improving communication; stimulating social support and promoting mental health. Most of the interventions sought to empower and stimulate self-efficacy while strengthening the perceived social support of the PLHIV. Studies reported a significant positive impact on improving various aspects of HIV competent household - positive effects on HIV knowledge, communication between household members, and improved mental health outcomes of youths living in HIV-affected households.
   Conclusion: By aiming to strengthen the perceived social support and self-efficacy of PLHIV, household-focused HIV interventions can address various aspects of household HIV competency. Nevertheless, the role of the household as an enabling resource to improve the outcomes of PLHIV remains largely untapped by public HIV programmes; more research on improving household HIV competency is therefore required.

SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH

DT Article
DE Social inequality; Health; Technology; Innovation; Discourse analysis;
   Norway
ID WELFARE STATES; SMALLEST
AB Background: As research increasingly investigates the impacts of technological innovations in health on social inequalities, political discourse often promotes development and adoption, limiting an understanding of unintended consequences. This study aimed to investigate national public health policy discourse focusing on innovative health technology and social inequalities, from a Norwegian context.
   Methods: The analysis relies on a perspective inspired by critical discourse analysis using central State documents typically influential in the lawmaking procedure.
   Results: The results and discussion focus on three major discourse strands: 1) 'technologies discourse' (types of technologies), 2) 'responsibility discourse' (who has responsibility for health and technology), 3) 'legitimization discourse' (how technologies are legitimized).
   Conclusions: Results suggest that despite an overt political imperative for reducing social inequalities, the Norwegian national discourse gives little attention to the potential for these innovations to unintentionally (re) produce social inequalities. Instead, it is characterized by neoliberal undertones, individualizing and commercializing public health and promoting pro-innovation ideology.

ID EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Background: Human brucellosis has become a severe public health problem in China's Guangxi Province, and there has been higher prevalence of brucellosis in this region after 2010. Both multiple locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) assay schedules were used to genotype isolates and determine relationships among isolates.
   Results: A total of 40 isolates of Brucella were obtained from humans, pigs, and dogs from 1961 to 2016. There were at least three species of Brucella detected in Guangxi Province, Brucella melitensis, Brucella suis, and Brucella canis, with 16, 17, and 7 isolates, respectively. Of which B. suis biovar 3 was the predominant species resulting in pig brucellosis in the area examined before 2000s. Moreover, B. melitensis biovar 3 was found to be mainly responsible for human brucellosis during 2012-2016. All B. melitensis isolates in this study belonged to East Mediterranean lineage. MLVA-11 genotype 116 was the dominant genotype and represented 81.2% of the isolates. MLVA cluster analysis showed there to be 44% (7/16) brucellosis cases caused by B. melitensis with a profile of outbreak epidemic from 2012 to 2016. However, nearly 83.3% (20/24) of brucellosis cases resulting from both B. suis and B. canis showed no epidemiological links or sporadic characteristics. MLVA-16 analysis confirmed extensive genotype-sharing events between B. melitensis isolates from Guangxi and other northern provinces within China. These data revealed that there are potential epidemiology links among these strains. B. suis strains of this study showed a unique genetic lineage at the global level and may have existed historically in this area. However, present B. canis isolates were closely related to previously reported isolates in Korea, where they may have originated. MLST typing showed that the population structure of Brucella strains had changed considerably in this province; ST17 and ST21, two previously predominant populations appeared to have been replaced by recently emerging ST8 group.
   Conclusions: Our investigation data have inspired the hypothesis that Guangxi Province had been subject to an imported human brucellosis epidemic. Our data suggest that strains found in Northern regions of China are the principal source of infections in recent cases of human brucellosis in Guangxi Province. Comparative genomic analysis from more strains is necessary to confirm this hypothesis. This work will facilitate better understanding of the epidemiology and improve the effectiveness of control and prevention of brucellosis in this region.

TI Active and adaptive case finding to estimate therapeutic program
   coverage for severe acute malnutrition: a capture-recapture study
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH

DT Article
DE Active and adaptive; Case finding; Capture recapture; Coverage; Severe
   acute malnutrition; SQUEAC; Therapeutic feeding program; Nigeria;
   Community-based management of acute malnutrition
AB Background: Coverage is an important indicator to assess both the performance and effectiveness of public health programs. Recommended methods for coverage estimation for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) can involve active and adaptive case finding (AACF), an informant-driven sampling procedure, for the identification of cases. However, as this procedure can yield a non-representative sample, exhaustive or near exhaustive case identification is needed for valid coverage estimation with AACF. Important uncertainty remains as to whether an adequate level of exhaustivity for valid coverage estimation can be ensured by AACF.
   Methods: We assessed the sensitivity of AACF and a census method using a capture-recapture design in northwestern Nigeria. Program coverage was estimated for each case finding procedure.
   Results: The sensitivity of AACF was 69.5% (95% CI: 59.8, 79.2) and 91.9% (95% CI: 85.1, 98.8) with census case finding. Program coverage was estimated to be 40.3% (95% CI 28.6, 52.0) using AACF, compared to 34.9% (95% CI 24.7, 45.2) using the census. Depending on the distribution of coverage among missed cases, AACF sensitivity of at least >= 70% was generally required for coverage estimation to remain within +/- 10% of the census estimate.
   Conclusion: Given the impact incomplete case finding and low sensitivity can have on coverage estimation in potentially non-representative samples, adequate attention and resources should be committed to ensure exhaustive or near exhaustive case finding.

TI Inequity in healthcare needs, health service use and financial burden of

   SCHEMES; EQUITY; ACCESS; CHALLENGES
AB Background: Although public medical insurance covers over 95% of the population in China, disparities in health service use and out-of-pocket (OOP) health expenditure across income groups are still widely observed. This study aims to investigate the socio-economic disparities in perceived healthcare needs, informal care, formal care and payment for healthcare and explore their equity implication.
   Methods: We assessed healthcare needs, service use and payment in 400 households in rural and urban areas in Jiangsu, China, and included only the adult sample (N = 925). One baseline survey and 10 follow-up surveys were conducted during the 7-month monitoring period, and the Affordability Ladder Program (ALP) framework was adopted for data analysis. Negative binomial/zero-inflated negative binomial and logit regression models were used to explore factors associated with perceived needs of care and with the use of self-treatment, outpatient and inpatient care respectively. Two-part model and logit regression modeling were conducted to explore factors associated with OOP health expenditure and with the likelihood of incurring catastrophic health expenditure (CHE).
   Results: After adjusting for covariates, rural residence was significantly associated with more perceived healthcare needs, more self-treatment, higher probability of using outpatient and inpatient service, more OOP health expenditure and higher likelihood of incurring catastrophic expenditure (P < 0.05). Compared to the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI), enrollment in the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS) or in the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) was correlated with lower probability of ever using outpatient services, but with more outpatient visits when people were at risk of using outpatient service (P < 0.05). NRCMS/URBMI enrollment was also associated with higher likelihood of incurring CHE compared to UEBMI enrollment (OR = 2.02, P < 0.05); in stratified analysis of the rural and urban sample this effect was only significant for the rural population.
   Conclusions: The rural population in Jiangsu perceived more healthcare needs, had a higher probability of using both informal and formal healthcare services, and had more OOP health expenditure and a higher likelihood of incurring CHE. The inequity mainly exists in health care financing, and may be partially addressed through improving the benefit packages of NRCMS/URBMI.

ID MATERNAL MORTALITY; CHILD HEALTH; PUNJAB
AB Background: Basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric care services in Pakistan remain a challenge considering continued high burden of maternal and newborn mortality. This study aimed to assess the availability of emergency obstetric and newborn care in Sindh Province of Pakistan.
   Methods: This cross-sectional survey was conducted in twelve districts of the Sindh province in Pakistan. The districts were selected based on the maternal neonatal and child health indicators. Data were collected from 63 public-sector health facilities including district, Taluka (subdistrict) headquarters hospitals and rural health centers. Basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric newborn care services were assessed through direct observations and interviews with the heads of the health facilities by using a World Health Organization pretested and validated data collection tool. Participants interviewed in this study included the managers and auxiliary staff and in health facilities.
   Results: Availability of caesarean section (23, 95% C.I. 14.0-35.0) and blood transfusion services (57, 95% CI. 44.0-68.0), the two components of comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care, was poor in our study. However, assessment of the seven components of basic emergency obstetric and newborn services showed that 92% of the health facilities (95% C.I. 88.0-96.0) had parenteral antibiotics, 90%, (95% C.I. 80.0-95.0) had oxytocin, 92% (95% CI 88.0-96.0) had manual removal of the placenta service, 87% (95%, C.I. 76.0-93.0) of the facilities had staff who could remove retained products of conception, 82% (95% C.I. 71.0-89.0) had facilities for normal birth and 80% (95% C.I. 69.0-88.0) reported presence of neonatal resuscitation service.
   Conclusion: Though the basic obstetric and newborn services were reasonably available, comprehensive obstetric and newborn services were not available as per the World Health Organization's standards in the surveyed public health facilities. Ensuring the availability of caesarean section and blood transfusion services within these facilities may improve population's access to these essential services around birth.

TI Spectrum of heart diseases in children presenting to a paediatric

DT Article
DE Heart disease; Congenital; Acquired; Paediatric; Cardiac;

ID DOWN-SYNDROME
AB Background: Congenital heart diseases (CHD) are among the most common congenital malformations. It is estimated that the incidence of CHD is constant worldwide, but data are rare for most African countries including Tanzania. Even less data are available on the prevalence of acquired heart diseases (AHD) in African children. Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is the leading cause of AHD and is remaining a public health concern in Sub-Saharan Africa affecting especially the younger population. Both, CHD and AHD contribute substantially to morbidity and mortality during infancy and childhood.
   Methods: This hospital-based, retrospective review of the registry at the paediatric cardiac clinic of Bugando Medical Centre in the Lake Zone of Tanzania analysed the spectrum of heart diseases of paediatric patients during their first presentation by using simple descriptive statistics.
   Results: Between September 2009 and August 2016, a total of 3982 patients received cardiac evaluation including echocardiography studies. 1830 (46.0%) pathologic findings were described, out of these 1371 (74.9%) patients had CHD, whereas 459 (25.1%) presented with AHD.
   53.9% of the patients with CHD were female and the most common associated syndrome was Down syndrome in 12.8% of patients. In 807 patients (58.9%) diagnosis of CHD was established within the first year of life. The majority of patients (60.1%) were in need of surgical or interventional therapy at time of diagnosis and 6.3% of patients were judged inoperable at the time of first presentation. Nearly 50% of cases with AHD were RHDs followed by dilated cardiomyopathy and pulmonary hypertension without underlying CHD.
   Conclusions: The spectrum of CHD and AHD from one centre in Tanzania is comparable to findings reported in other countries from the African continent. Echocardiography is a valuable diagnostic tool and the widespread use of it should be enhanced to diagnose heart diseases in a large number and reasonable time. Most patients present late and majority is in need of surgical or interventional treatment, which is still not readily available. Untreated heart diseases contribute substantially to morbidity and mortality during infancy and childhood. Adequate cardiac services should be established and strengthened.

TI Linking surveillance and clinical data for evaluating trends in
   bloodstream infection rates in neonatal units in England
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID NOSOCOMIAL INFECTION; MATCHING MICHIGAN; RISK-FACTORS
AB Objective
   To evaluate variation in trends in bloodstream infection (BSI) rates in neonatal units (NNUs) in England according to the data sources and linkage methods used.
   Methods
   We used deterministic and probabilistic methods to link clinical records from 112 NNUs in the National Neonatal Research Database (NNRD) to national laboratory infection surveillance data from Public Health England. We calculated the proportion of babies in NNRD (aged < 1 year and admitted between 2010-2017) with a BSI caused by clearly pathogenic organisms between two days after admission and two days after discharge. We used Poisson regression to determine trends in the proportion of babies with BSI based on i) deterministic and probabilistic linkage of NNRD and surveillance data (primary measure), ii) deterministic linkage of NNRD-surveillance data, iii) NNRD records alone, and iv) linked NNRD-surveillance data augmented with clinical records of laboratory-confirmed BSI in NNRD.
   Results
   Using deterministic and probabilistic linkage, 5,629 of 349,740 babies admitted to a NNU in NNRD linked with 6,660 BSI episodes accounting for 38% of 17,388 BSI records aged < 1 year in surveillance data. The proportion of babies with BSI due to clearly pathogenic organisms during their NNU admission was 1.0% using deterministic plus probabilistic linkage (primary measure), compared to 1.0% using deterministic linkage alone, 0.6% using NNRD records alone, and 1.2% using linkage augmented with clinical records of BSI in NNRD. Equivalent proportions for babies born before 32 weeks of gestation were 5.0%, 4.8%, 2.9% and 5.9%. The proportion of babies who linked to a BSI decreased by 7.5% each year (95% confidence interval [CI]: -14.3%, -0.1%) using deterministic and probabilistic linkage but was stable using clinical records of BSI or deterministic linkage alone.
   Conclusion
   Linkage that combines BSI records from national laboratory surveillance and clinical NNU data sources, and use of probabilistic methods, substantially improved ascertainment of BSI and estimates of BSI trends over time, compared with single data sources.

AB This study aims to investigate the association between health conditions and overweight in climacteric women assisted by primary care professionals. It is a cross-sectional study conducted with 874 women from 40 to 65 years of age, selected by probabilistic sampling between August 2014 and August 2015. In addition to the outcome variable, overweight and obesity, other variables such as sociodemographic, reproductive, clinical, eating and behavioural factors were evaluated. Descriptive analyses of the variables investigated were performed to determine their frequency distributions. Then, bivariate analyses were performed through Poisson regression. For the multivariate analyses, hierarchical Poisson regression was used to identify factors associated with overweight and obesity in the climacteric period. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was 74%. Attending public school (PR: 1.30-95% CI 1.14-1.50), less schooling (PR: 1.11-95% CI 1.01-1.23), gout (PR: 1.18-95% CI 1.16-1.44), kidney disease (PR: 1.18-95% CI 1.05-1.32), metabolic syndrome (MS) (PR: 1.19-95% CI 1.05-1.34) and fat intake (PR: 1.12-95% CI 1.02-1.23) were considered risk factors for overweight. Having the first birth after 18 years of age (PR: 0.89-95% CI 0.82 to 0.97) was shown to be a protective factor for overweight and obesity. The presence of overweight and obesity is associated with sociodemographic, reproductive, clinical and eating habits.

TI Pathways to care and outcomes among hospitalised HIV-seropositive
   persons with cryptococcal meningitis in South Africa
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH
AB Introduction
   Cryptococcus causes 15% of AIDS-related deaths and in South Africa, with its high HIV burden, is the dominant cause of adult meningitis. Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) mortality is high, partly because patients enter care with advanced HIV disease and because of failure of integrated care following CM diagnosis. We evaluated pathways to hospital care, missed opportunities for HIV testing and initiation of care.
   Methods
   We performed a cross-sectional study at five public-sector urban hospitals. We enrolled adults admitted with a first or recurrent episode of cryptococcal meningitis. Study nurses conducted interviews, supplemented by a prospective review of medical charts and laboratory records.
   Results
   From May to October 2015, 102 participants were enrolled; median age was 40 years (interquartile range [IQR] 33.9-46.7) and 56 (55%) were male. In the six weeks prior to admission, 2/102 participants were asymptomatic, 72/100 participants sought care at a public-sector facility, 16/100 paid for private health care. The median time from seeking care to admission was 4 days (IQR, 0-27 days). Of 94 HIV-seropositive participants, only 62 (66%) knew their status and 41/62 (66%) had ever taken antiretroviral treatment. Among 13 participants with a known previous CM episode, none were taking fluconazole maintenance therapy. In-hospital management was mostly amphotericin B; in-hospital mortality was high (28/92, 30%). Sixty-four participants were discharged, 92% (59/64) on maintenance fluconazole, 4% (3/64) not on fluconazole and 3% (2/64) unknown. Twelve weeks post-discharge, 31/64 (48%) participants were lost to follow up. By 12 weeks post discharge 7/33 (21%) had died. Interviewed patients were asked if they were still on fluconazole, 11% (2/18) were not.
   Conclusions
   Among hospitalised participants with CM, there were many missed opportunities for HIV care and linkage to ART prior to admission. Universal reflex CrAg screening may prompt earlier diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis but there is a wider problem of timely linkage to care for HIV-seropositive people.

AB Background: Global annual deaths are rising. It is essential to examine where future deaths may occur to facilitate decisions regarding future service provision and resource allocation.
   Aims: To project where people will die from 2017 to 2040 in an ageing country with advanced integrated palliative care, and to prioritise recommendations based on these trends.
   Methods: Population-based trend analysis of place of death for people that died in Scotland (2004-2016) and projections using simple linear modelling (2017-2040); Transparent Expert Consultation to prioritise recommendations in response to projections.
   Results: Deaths are projected to increase by 15.9% from 56,728 in 2016 (32.8% aged 85+ years) to 65,757 deaths in 2040 (45% aged 85+ years). Between 2004 and 2016, proportions of home and care home deaths increased (19.8-23.4% and 14.5-18.8%), while the proportion of hospital deaths declined (58.0-50.1%). If current trends continue, the numbers of deaths at home and in care homes will increase, and two-thirds will die outside hospital by 2040. To sustain current trends, priorities include: 1) to increase and upskill a community health and social care workforce through education, training and valuing of care work; 2) to build community care capacity through informal carer support and community engagement; 3) to stimulate a realistic public debate on death, dying and sustainable funding.
   Conclusion: To sustain current trends, health and social care provision in the community needs to grow to support nearly 60% more people at the end-of-life by 2040; otherwise hospital deaths will increase.

AB Background Lack of physical activity (PA) is a recognised global public health problem, which is increasing in prevalence with a detrimental impact on the pattern of disease worldwide. In the UK, older adults comprise the most sedentary group, with only 57% of males and 52% of females aged 65-74 years and 43% of males and 21% of females aged 75-84 years meeting PA recommendations. PA confers multiple health benefits including increased stamina, muscle, bone and joint strength, increased independence and reduced risk of falls in old age. Despite benefits experienced during time-limited PA programmes, increased PA is not always continued. This study aimed to provide a better understanding of PA maintenance behaviours in older people. Methods Face to face semi-structured interviews were conducted with adults who completed one of two strength and balance exercise programmes as part of the ProAct65+ trial: group (FaME) and home based (OTAGO) exercises. Five GP practices in Nottingham and Derby were recruited and invited people aged 65 years and older who met eligibility criteria. Interviews were conducted in participants' homes. Interviews explored PA levels pre and post intervention, perceived health benefits, facilitators, barriers and use of technology for PA maintenance. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using framework analysis and the software NVivo10. Results Fifteen participants from each intervention group were interviewed. The FaME group consisted of 10 females and 5 males, age range of 70-88 years. The OTAGO group consisted of 12 females and 3 males aged 72-95 years. Important themes identified were physical, social, psychological and environmental facilitators and barriers. These included increased physical autonomy, enjoyment, positive evaluation of the activity and physical benefits, importance of social interaction, positive feedback, development of behaviour considered normal or habitual, motivation and self-efficacy. Some participants used technologies not included in the original interventions, like pedometers and smart phones to motivate themselves. Conclusions A range of modifiable factors influence continued participation in PA at the end of exercise programmes. The findings from this study will inform the commissioning and quality improvement of future PA programmes and development of an intervention to enhance continuation of PA after exercise interventions in older adults.

AB Background Few empirical studies support a bio-psycho-social conceptualization of frailty. In addition to physical frailty (PF), we explored mental (MF) and social (SF) frailty and studied the associations between multidimensional frailty and various adverse health outcomes. Methods Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were conducted using data from a population-based cohort (SLAS-1) of 2387 community-dwelling Singaporean Chinese older adults. Outcomes examined were functional and severe disability, nursing home referral and mortality. PF was defined by shrinking, weakness, slowness, exhaustion and physical inactivity, 1-2 = pre-frail, 3-5 = frail; MF was defined by >= 1 of cognitive impairment, low mood and poor self-reported health; SF was defined by >= 2 of living alone, no education, no confidant, infrequent social contact or help, infrequent social activities, financial difficulty and living in low-end public housing. Results The prevalence of any frailty dimension was 63.0%, dominated by PF (26.2%) and multidimensional frailty (24.2%); 7.0% had all three frailty dimensions. With a few exceptions, frailty dimensions share similar associations with many socio-demographic, lifestyle, health and behavioral factors. Each frailty dimension varied in showing independent associations with functional (Odds Ratios [ORs] = 1.3-1.8) and severe disability prevalence at baseline (ORs = 2.2-7.3), incident functional disability (ORs = 1.1-1.5), nursing home referral (ORs = 1.5-3.4) and mortality (Hazard Ratios = 1.3-1.5) after adjusting for age, gender, medical comorbidity and the two other frailty dimensions. The addition of MF and SF to PF incrementally increased risk estimates by more than 2 folds. Conclusions This study highlights the relevance and utility of PF, MF and SF individually and together. Multidimensional frailty can better inform policies and promote the use of targeted multi-domain interventions tailored to older adults' frailty statuses.

AB Background Despite a variety of contraceptives being available for women in South Africa, a considerable number of adolescent girls and young women still face challenges in using them. This paper examines socio-demographic and behavioral predictors of using contraceptives among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) aged 15 to 24 years. Methods A secondary data analysis was conducted based on the 2012 population-based nationally representative multi-stage stratified cluster randomised household survey. Multivariate backward stepwise logistic regression model was used to examine socio-demographic and behavioural factors independently associated with contraceptive use amongst AGYW aged 15 to 24 years in South Africa. Results Out of 1460 AGYW, 78% (CI: 73.9-81.7) reported using some form of contraceptives. In the model, contraceptive use was significantly associated with secondary education [OR = 1.8 (1.2-2.7), p = 0.005], having a sexual partner within 5 years of their age [OR = 1.8 (1.2-2.5), p = 0.002], and sexual debut at age 15 years and older [OR = 2.5 (1.3-4.6), p = 0.006]. The likelihood of association decreased with other race groups-White, Coloured, and Indians/Asians [OR = 0.5 (0.3-0.7), p = 0.001], being married [OR = 0.4 (0.2-0.7), p = 0.001], never given birth [OR = 0.7 (0.5-0.9), p = 0.045], coming from rural informal [OR = 0.5 (0.3-0.9), p = 0.010] and rural formal settlements [OR = 0.5 (0.3-0.9), p = 0.020]. Conclusions Evidence suggest that interventions should be tailor-made to meet the needs of AGYW in order to, promote use and access to contraceptives. The results also suggest that family planning interventions should target those who had not given birth in order to reduce unplanned and or unintended pregnancies and associated risk factors. These findings contribute to public health discourse and reproductive health planning for these age groups in the country.

TI Re-introduction of dengue virus serotype 2 in the state of Rio de
   Janeiro after almost a decade of epidemiological silence
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID BRAZIL; AMERICA; TYPE-2
AB The Asian/American genotype of dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) has been introduced in Brazil through the state of Rio de Janeiro around 1990, and since then it has been spreading and evolving, leading to several waves of dengue epidemics throughout the country that cause a major public health problem. Of particular interest has been the epidemic of 2008, whose highest impact was evidenced in the state of Rio de Janeiro, with a higher number of severe cases and mortality rate, compared to previous outbreaks. Interestingly, no circulation of DENV-2 was witnessed in this region during the preceding 9-year period. By early 2010, phylogenetic analysis of the 2008 epidemic strain revealed that the outbreak was caused by a new viral lineage of the Asian/American genotype, which was pointed as responsible for the outbreak severity as well. The same scenario is repeating in 2019 in this state; however, only a few cases have been detected yet. To provide information that helps to the understanding of DENV-2 dynamics in the state of Rio de Janeiro, and thereafter contribute to public health control and prevention actions, we employed phylogenetic studies combined with temporal and dynamics geographical features to determine the origin of the current viral strain. To this effect, we analyzed a region of 1626 nucleotides entailing the Envelope/NS1 viral genes. Our study reveals that the current strain belongs to the same lineage that caused the 2008 outbreak, however, it is phylogenetically distant from any Brazilian strain identified so far. Indeed, it seemed to be originated in Puerto Rico around 2002 and has been introduced into the state in late 2018. Taking into account that no DENV-2 case was reported over the last decade in the state (representing a whole susceptible children generation), and the fact that a new viral strain may be causing current dengue infections, these results will be influential in strengthening dengue surveillance and disease control, mitigating the potential epidemiological consequences of virus spread.

AB Background: Abdominal obesity and presence of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) significantly increase the risk of developing diseases such as Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with escalating emergence of MetS and T2DM constituting a significant public health crisis worldwide. Lower prevalence of inflammatory and metabolic diseases such as T2DM in countries with higher incidences of helminth infections suggested a potential role for these parasites in the prevention and management of certain diseases. Recent studies confirmed the potential protective nature of helminth infection against MetS and T2DM via immunomodulation or, potentially, alteration of the intestinal microbiota. This Phase 1b safety and tolerability trial aims to assess the effect of inoculation with helminths on physical and metabolic parameters, immune responses, and the microbiome in otherwise healthy women and men.
   Methods: Participants eligible for inclusion are adults aged 18-50 with central obesity and a minimum of one additional feature of MetS recruited from the local community with a recruitment target of 54. In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, three groups will receive either 20 or 40 stage three larvae of the human hookworm Necator americanus or a placebo. Eligible participants will provide blood and faecal samples at their baseline and 6-monthly assessment visits for a total of 24 months with an optional extension to 36 months. During each scheduled visit, participants will also undergo a full physical examination and complete diet (PREDIMED), physical activity, and patient health (PHQ-9) questionnaires. Outcome measurements include tolerability and safety of infection with Necator americanus, changes in metabolic and immunological parameters, and changes in the composition of the faecal microbiome.
   Discussion: Rising cost of healthcare associated with obesity-induced metabolic diseases urgently calls for new approaches in disease prevention. Findings from this trial will provide valuable information regarding the potential mechanisms by which hookworms, potentially via alterations in the microbiota, may positively influence metabolic health.

TI Prevalence and associated factors of zinc deficiency among pregnant
   women and children in Ethiopia: a systematic review and meta-analysis
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Review
DE Zinc deficiency; Children; Pregnant women; Ethiopia
AB Background: Pregnant women and children are the most vulnerable groups to zinc deficiency. Despite the presence of few primary studies, studies that could provide strong evidence that would help policymakers to develop appropriate interventional strategies in addressing zinc deficiency among pregnant women and children are limited in Ethiopia. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the national pooled prevalence and associated factors of zinc deficiency among pregnant women and children.
   Methods: We searched Pub Med, Scopus, CINAHL, Google Scholar, and Google for studies reported on zinc deficiency and associated factors among pregnant women and children. Search terms were 'zinc deficiency', 'zinc status', 'associated factors', 'children', 'pregnant women', and 'Ethiopia' using the boolean operators 'OR' or 'AND'. Searches were using English language. A preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) checklist was used. Two authors independently reviewed the studies. The effect sizes of the meta-analysis were the prevalence of zinc deficiency and adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of the associated factors. Finally, the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) version 3.3.07 was used for statistical analysis by applying the random-effects model and publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger's test.
   Results: Thirteen studies (7 among pregnant women having total participants of 2371 pregnant women and 6 among children with total participants of 5154 children) were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Using the random-effects model, the pooled prevalence of zinc deficiency was 59.9% (95%CI: 51.9, 67.7%) and 38.4% (95%CI: 28.6, 49.4) among pregnant women and children, respectively. The associated factors for zinc deficiency among pregnant women were coffee intake (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) =1.76), low intake of animal source foods (AOR = 2.57), and inadequate diet diversity (AOR = 2.12).
   Conclusion: Overall, zinc deficiency among pregnant women and children is a significant public health concern in Ethiopia. Promoting dietary modification to enhance the bioavailability of zinc, improving diet diversity, and consuming animal source foods would help in alleviating and/or minimizing the problem among the target groups. Zinc supplementation could also be considered for pregnant women and children.

AB Background: Anemia among Women of Reproductive Age (WRA) continues to be among the major public health problems in many developing countries, including Rwanda, where it increased in prevalence between the 2015 and 2010 Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey (RDHS) reports. A thorough understanding of its risk factors is necessary to design better interventions. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted in Rwanda on a nationally representative sample to assess factors associated with anemia among WRA. Accordingly, this study was conducted to address such gap.
   Methods: A quantitative, cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the RDHS 2014-2015. The study population consisted of 6680 WRA who were tested for anemia during the survey. Anemia was defined as having a hemoglobin level equal to or below 10.9 g/dl for a pregnant woman, and hemoglobin level equal to or below 11.9 g/dl for a non-pregnant woman. Pearson's chi-squared test and multiple logistic regression were conducted for bivariate and multivariable analysis, respectively.
   Results: The prevalence of anemia among WRA was 19.2% (95% CI: 18.0-20.5). Four factors were found to be associated with lower odds of anemia, including being obese (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.40-0.91), being in the rich category (OR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.63-0.87), sleeping under a mosquito net (OR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.74-0.98), and using hormonal contraceptives (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.50-0.73). Five factors were associated with higher odds of anemia, including being underweight (OR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.09-1.78), using an intrauterine device (OR: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.05-3.75), being separated or widowed (OR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.09-1.67), and living in the Southern province (OR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.11-1.89) or in the Eastern province (OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.06-1.88).
   Conclusion: Anemia continues to pose public health challenges; novel public health interventions should consider geographic variations in anemia risk, seek to improve women's economic statuses, and strengthen iron supplementation especially for Intrauterine device users. Additionally, given the association between anemia and malaria, interventions to prevent malaria should be enhanced.

   ENCEPHALITIS; ATTITUDES; DETERMINANTS; KNOWLEDGE
AB Background: In Scandinavia, the distribution of ticks is expanding and tick-borne diseases constitute growing health risks. While the probability of getting a tick-borne disease after a tick bite is low, the health impacts can be large. This, as well as other characteristics of these diseases make tick-related risks difficult for laypeople to assess and perceived risk may differ substantially from actual risk. Understanding risk perceptions is important since it is the perceived risk, rather than actual risk, that determine behaviour and even more so for new and emerging risks. The aim of this study is to investigate knowledge and risk perceptions related to tick bites and the tick-borne diseases Lyme borreliosis (LB) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE). By analysing risk perceptions and knowledge, the study helps inform the development of public health strategies in response to the increasing incidence of these diseases in Scandinavia.
   Methods: Two thousand, six hundred sixty-eight respondents in Denmark, Norway and Sweden answered an online questionnaire with 48 questions, including 7 questions on risk perceptions and 9 knowledge questions. Chi-squared tests were used to analyse statistical differences between country sub-samples, gender and age groups. A multivariate regression model was used to analyse factors associated with risk perceptions.
   Results: Risk perceptions were on average high in comparison with scientific estimates, with respondents grossly overrating the probability of contracting LB or TBE if bitten by a tick. Also, the average perceived seriousness of a single tick bite and of getting LB or TBE was high. Knowledge on the other hand was low, especially among men and the youngest age group (18-29 years). Higher levels of knowledge about tick-borne diseases were associated with lower perceived seriousness of tick bites and LB and higher perceived seriousness of TBE. Also, having been diagnosed with LB was negatively associated with the perceived seriousness of LB.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that informing about ticks and tick-borne diseases would be a relevant public health strategy as it could make risk perceptions better aligned with actual risk. Should the TBE virus spread further in Denmark and Norway, increasing knowledge about TBE vaccination would be especially important.

SO BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
LA English
DT Article
ID IRON-DEFICIENCY; MALARIA
AB Background: Anaemia during pregnancy is a major public health problem in developing countries. It is important to regularly monitor haemoglobin level in pregnancy and factors associated with it to inform clinical and preventive services. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and determinants of anaemia in pregnant women attending antenatal clinic (ANC) of a tertiary referral hospital in Northern Ghana.
   Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study involving 400 pregnant women receiving antenatal care in Tamale Teaching Hospital was conducted. Using a semi-structured questionnaire and 24-h dietary recall, data were collected on socio-demographic characteristics, health practices, dietary diversity, anaemia knowledge and haemoglobin level of the women. Anaemia was defined as haemoglobin concentration less than 11 g/dl. Chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were used to identify the independent determinants of pregnancy anaemia.
   Results: The mean age and haemoglobin of the women were 28.3 (+/- 4.5) years and 10.81 (+/- 1.41) g/dl respectively. About half of the women 50.8% [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 45.8-55.7] were anaemic and the prevalence of anaemia increased with pregnancy trimester. Among a host of socio-demographic, dietary, and preventive health service factors evaluated, the women's knowledge on anaemia and pregnancy trimester at interview were the independent determinants of anaemia in pregnancy. Compared to women of the highest anaemia knowledge tertile, women belonging to the lowest (AOR = 2.63, 95% CI: 1.50-4.61) and middle (AOR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.12-3.27) anaemia knowledge tertiles were about 3 and 2 times more likely to be anaemic respectively. Similarly, women in third trimester of pregnancy were about 4 times more likely to be anaemic compared to those in first trimester at the time of interview (AOR = 3.57, 95% CI: 1.91-6.67).
   Conclusions: There is a high prevalence of anaemia, which increases with pregnancy trimester, in pregnant women attending ANC in a tertiary referral hospital in Northern Ghana. The women's knowledge on anaemia and pregnancy trimester at the time of interview are associated with their anaemia status. The high prevalence of anaemia in pregnancy needs urgent intervention to prevent the occurrence of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Education on anaemia should be intensified at ANCs.

AB Background: Diphtheria has been reported as an outbreak in some regions in Indonesia, most especially in East Java Province. Resistance to penicillin, erythromycin, and other antibiotics, single or multiple, has been reported in several studies. This study aims to evaluate the first-line antibiotic susceptibility pattern of toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae isolates.
   Methods: This descriptive observational study was performed from August to November 2018. C. diphtheriae isolates were collected from diphtheria patients and carriers in East Java from 2012 to 2017 and kept at the Balai Besar Laboratorium Kesehatan Daerah Surabaya or the Public Health Laboratory of Surabaya. Sample selection was done by random cluster sampling. The sensitivity test by E-test (R) of the five antibiotics (penicillin, oxacillin, erythromycin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin) was done to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute M45A (2015) Corynebacterium spp. for penicillin and erythromycin was used as standard.
   Results: From 114 targeted isolates, 108 were viable and toxigenic. The E-test was performed on the viable isolates. The majority of the hosts were male (58.3%), with median (range) age of 6.5 (1-14) years. Half of the samples were from the 1 to 5-year-old age group. The isolates were acquired much more from patients (78.7%) than carriers (21.3%) and from pharyngeal swab (74.1%). Most of these isolates were from Madura Island (47.2%) and the northern and eastern parts of the province (horseshoe area). Mitis isolates were the major variant (76.9%). The susceptibility pattern of C. diphtheriae to erythromycin was better than that to penicillin. The E-test result for penicillin was 68.52% susceptible, 31.48% intermediate, and 0% resistant (MIC range, < 0.016 to 2 mu g/L) and for erythromycin (MIC range, < 0.016 to > 256 mu g/L) was 85.2% susceptible, 12% intermediate, and 2.8% resistant The MIC range for oxacillin was 1 to 96 mu g/L, while for both azithromycin and clarithromycin were < 0.016 to > 256 mu g/L.
   Conclusion: The susceptibility rate of C. diphtheriae to erythromycin is higher than that to penicillin. The regular update of antibiotic selection to the national guidelines is recommended. The MIC reference standard to azithromycin and clarithromycin is also needed.

AB Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) increasingly threatens public health. Carbapenem-producing gram-negative bacteria (CPB) pose the biggest threat. The risk for CPB spread is heightened during the transfer of a CPB-positive patient between different healthcare institutions or healthcare providers. We aimed to gain insight into the frequency of CPB-positive patients in the Dutch provinces of Noord-Holland (NH) and Flevoland (FL). Secondly, we aimed to obtain a deeper understanding of the communication between healthcare providers during transfers of CPB-positive patients and explore possible communication-related risk situations for CPB spread.
   Methods: This mixed-methods study consisted of a quantitative and qualitative section. For the quantitative section, 14 laboratories that provide diagnostics in NH and FL voluntarily reported carbapenem-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) positive patients between February 2018 and February 2019. Additionally, two laboratories reported carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. (CRA) and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRP) positive patients. For the qualitative section, healthcare providers of reported patients were interviewed about information exchange during patient transfers, precautionary measures and knowledge and beliefs concerning CPB.
   Results: In total, 50 CPE-positive, 10 CRA-positive and 4 CRP-positive patients were reported during the inclusion period. Eighteen index-specific and 2 general interviews were conducted with 20 different care providers of 9 patients. The interviews revealed that, in most cases, information concerning the patient was transferred timely, but often a standardized method for sharing the information within and between institutions was lacking. Factors that enhanced care providers' motivation to adhere to precautionary measures were taking responsibility for the health of other patients, (pregnant) colleagues and for ones own health. Factors that reduced motivation were not acknowledging the relevance of the precautionary measures, a perceived negative impact of the measures on patients' recovery, differences in precautionary measures between healthcare settings and incomprehension for changes in precautionary measures.
   Conclusions: CPB-positivity occurred more frequently than expected in the Dutch provinces of NH and FL. Standardizing the transference of information concerning CPB-positive patients, implementing transmural agreements, training personnel on CPB knowledge and procedures, launching a national website on CPB and assigning one or several designated employees for CPB within healthcare institutions could improve communication between healthcare providers and thereby decrease the risk of CPB transmission.

AB Background: Rising health care costs are a major public health issue. Thus, accurately predicting future costs and understanding which factors contribute to increases in health care expenditures are important. The objective of this project was to predict patients healthcare costs development in the subsequent year and to identify factors contributing to this prediction, with a particular focus on the role of pharmacotherapy.
   Methods: We used 2014-2015 Swiss health insurance claims data on 373'264 adult patients to classify individuals' changes in health care costs. We performed extensive feature generation and developed predictive models using logistic regression, boosted decision trees and neural networks. Based on the decision tree model, we performed a detailed feature importance analysis and subgroup analysis, with an emphasis on drug classes.
   Results: The boosted decision tree model achieved an overall accuracy of 67.6% and an area under the curve-score of 0.74; the neural network and logistic regression models performed 0.4 and 1.9% worse, respectively. Feature engineering played a key role in capturing temporal patterns in the data. The number of features was reduced from 747 to 36 with only a 0.5% loss in the accuracy. In addition to hospitalisation and outpatient physician visits, 6 drug classes and the mode of drug administration were among the most important features. Patient subgroups with a high probability of increase (up to 88%) and decrease (up to 92%) were identified.
   Conclusions: Pharmacotherapy provides important information for predicting cost increases in the total population. Moreover, its relative importance increases in combination with other features, including health care utilisation.

AB Brucellosis in sheep and goats, a zoonotic disease primarily associated with Brucella melitensis infections, causes significant economic losses and public health concerns worldwide. Although control measures are effective, economic limitations and nomadic lifestyles may limit vaccination coverage, and test and removal policies may not be feasible. In this study, we evaluated the effects of therapy with a long acting antimicrobial tulathromycin on the pathogenesis of brucellosis. Thirty-five goats were randomly assigned for experimental infection with B. melitensis strain 16M while open or during mid-gestation. Approximately half of the animals in each group were then treated with tulathromycin and subsequently assessed for the development of humoral responses to infection, clinical presentation, and bacterial dissemination and colonization. All animals, regardless of treatment group were successfully challenged with B. melitensis 16M demonstrated by bacterial recovery from conjunctival swabs and development of positive antibody titers. In goats infected while open, no animals aborted and Brucella was recovered from only one animal in tulathromy-cin-treated and one animal from the untreated group. Tulathromycin treatment of pregnant goats did not prevent abortion nor did it reduce bacterial dissemination, colonization, or shedding. Our data suggests that treatment of goats in mid-gestation with tulathromycin at the labeled dose does not influence disease pathogenesis or tissue colonization after experimental B. melitensis challenge.

TI Modelling tick bite risk by combining random forests and count data

   EXPOSURE; URBAN; DIVERSITY; HABITATS; PARKS
AB The socio-economic and demographic changes that occurred over the past 50 years have dramatically expanded urban areas around the globe, thus bringing urban settlers in closer contact with nature. Ticks have trespassed the limits of forests and grasslands to start inhabiting green spaces within metropolitan areas. Hence, the transmission of pathogens causing tick-borne diseases is an important threat to public health. Using volunteered tick bite reports collected by two Dutch initiatives, here we present a method to model tick bite risk using human exposure and tick hazard predictors. Our method represents a step forward in risk modelling, since we combine a well-known ensemble learning method, Random Forest, with four count data models of the (zero-inflated) Poisson family. This combination allows us to better model the disproportions inherent in the volunteered tick bite reports. Unlike canonical machine learning models, our method can capture the overdispersion or zero-inflation inherent in data, thus yielding tick bite risk predictions that resemble the original signal captured by volunteers. Mapping model predictions enables a visual inspection of the spatial patterns of tick bite risk in the Netherlands. The Veluwe national park and the Utrechtse Heuvelrug forest, which are large forest-urban interfaces with several cities, are areas with high tick bite risk. This is expected, since these are popular places for recreation and tick activity is high in forests. However, our model can also predict high risk in less-intensively visited recreational areas, such as the patchy forests in the northeast of the country, the natural areas along the coastline, or some of the Frisian Islands. Our model could help public health specialists to design mitigation strategies for tick-borne diseases, and to target risky areas with awareness and prevention campaigns.

TI Proposal for a Global Adherence Scale for Acute Conditions (GASAC): A
   prospective cohort study in two emergency departments
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MEDICATION ADHERENCE; PATIENT ADHERENCE; QUESTIONNAIRE; SATISFACTION;
   EXPERIENCES; VALIDITY; CARE
AB Background
   Adherence in the context of patients with acute conditions is a major public health issue. It is neglected by the research community and no clinically validated generic scale exists to measure it.
   Objective
   To construct and validate a Global Adherence Scale usable in the context of Acute Conditions (GASAC) that takes into account adherence both to advice and to all types of prescriptions that the doctor may give. To measure adherence and to study its determinants.
   Materials and method
   We based the construction of the GASAC questionnaire on a theoretical model and a literature search. Then, between 2013 and 2014, we validated it in a prospective observational study in two hospital emergency departments. Patients were contacted by phone about one week after their consultation to answer several questionnaires, including GASAC and the Girerd self-administered questionnaire about medication adherence as a control.
   Results
   GASAC consists of four adherence subscales: drug prescriptions; blood tests/radiography prescriptions; lifestyle advice and follow-up instructions. An analysis of the 154 sets of answers from patients showed that the GASAC drug subscale had satisfactory internal coherence (Cronbach's alpha = 0.78) and was correlated with the Girerd score, as was GASAC as a whole (p< 0.01). The median score was 0.93 IQR [0.78-1] for a maximum value of 1 (n = 154). In multivariaable analysis, infection was more conducive of good adherence (cut off at. 0.8; n = 115/154; 74.7% [67.0-81.3]) than trauma (OR 3.69; CI [1.60-8.52]). The Doctor-Patient Communication score (OR 1.06 by score point, CI [1.02-1.10]) also influenced adherence.
   Conclusions
   GASAC is a generic score to measure all dimensions of patient adherence following emergency departments visits, for use in clinical research and the evaluation of clinical practice. The level of adherence was high for acute conditions and Doctor-Patient Communication was a major determinant of adherence.

AB Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is high on the UK public health policy agenda, and poses challenges to patient safety and the provision of health services. Widespread prescribing of antibiotics is thought to increase AMR, and mostly takes place in primary medical care. However, prescribing rates vary substantially between general practices. The aim of this study was to understand contextual factors related to general practitioners' (GPs) antibiotic prescribing behaviour in low, high, and around the mean (medium) prescribing primary care practices.
   Methods: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 41 GPs working in North-West England. Participants were purposively sampled from practices with low, medium, and high antibiotic prescribing rates adjusted for the number and characteristics of patients registered in a practice. The interviews were analysed thematically.
   Results: This study found that optimizing antibiotic prescribing creates tensions for GPs, particularly in doctor-patient communication during a consultation. GPs balanced patient expectations and their own decision-making in their communication. When not prescribing antibiotics, GPs reported the need for supportive mechanisms, such as regular practice meetings, within the practice, and in the wider healthcare system (e.g. longer consultation times). In low prescribing practices, GPs reported that increasing dialogue with colleagues, having consistent patterns of prescribing within the practice, supportive practice policies, and enough resources such as consultation time were important supports when not prescribing antibiotics.
   Conclusions: Insight into GPs' negotiations with patient and public health demands, and consistent and supportive practice-level policies can help support prudent antibiotic prescribing among primary care practices.

AB Background: Tuberculosis (TB) represents a worldwide cause of mortality (it infects one third of the world's population) affecting mostly developing countries, including India, and recently also developed ones due to the increased mobility of the world population and the evolution of different new bacterial strains capable to provoke multidrug resistance phenomena. Currently, antitubercular drugs are unable to eradicate subpopulations of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacilli and therapeutic vaccinations have been postulated to overcome some of the critical issues related to the increase of drug-resistant forms and the difficult clinical and public health management of tuberculosis patients. The Horizon 2020 EC funded project "In Silico Trial for Tuberculosis Vaccine Development" (STriTuVaD) to support the identification of new therapeutic interventions against tuberculosis through novel in silico modelling of human immune responses to disease and vaccines, thereby drastically reduce the cost of clinical trials in this critical sector of public healthcare.
   Results: We present the application of the Universal Immune System Simulator (UISS) computational modeling infrastructure as a disease model for TB. The model is capable to simulate the main features and dynamics of the immune system activities i.e., the artificial immunity induced by RUTI (R) vaccine, a polyantigenic liposomal therapeutic vaccine made of fragments of Mycobacterium tuberculosis cells (FCMtb). Based on the available data coming from phase II Clinical Trial in subjects with latent tuberculosis infection treated with RUTI (R) and isoniazid, we generated simulation scenarios through validated data in order to tune UISS accordingly to STriTuVaD objectives. The first case simulates the establishment of MTB latent chronic infection with some typical granuloma formation; the second scenario deals with a reactivation phase during latent chronic infection; the third represents the latent chronic disease infection scenario during RUTI (R) vaccine administration.
   Conclusions: The application of this computational modeling strategy helpfully contributes to simulate those mechanisms involved in the early stages and in the progression of tuberculosis infection and to predict how specific therapeutical strategies will act in this scenario. In view of these results, UISS owns the capacity to open the door for a prompt integration of in silico methods within the pipeline of clinical trials, supporting and guiding the testing of treatments in patients affected by tuberculosis.

AB Background: Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus affecting approximately 90% of the world population. HCMV causes disease in immunologically naive and immunosuppressed patients. The prevention, diagnosis and therapy of HCMV infection are thus crucial to public health. The availability of effective prophylactic and therapeutic treatments remain a significant challenge and no vaccine is currently available. Here, we sought to define an epitope-based vaccine against HCMV, eliciting B and T cell responses, from experimentally defined HCMV specific epitopes.
   Results: We selected 398 and 790 experimentally validated HCMV-specific B and T cell epitopes, respectively, from available epitope resources and apply a knowledge-based approach in combination with immunoinformatic predictions to ensemble a universal vaccine against HCMV. The T cell component consists of 6 CD8 and 6 CD4 T cell epitopes that are conserved among HCMV strains. All CD8 T cell epitopes were reported to induce cytotoxic activity, are derived from early expressed genes and are predicted to provide population protection coverage over 97%. The CD4 T cell epitopes are derived from HCMV structural proteins and provide a population protection coverage over 92%. The B cell component consists of just 3 B cell epitopes from the ectodomain of glycoproteins L and H that are highly flexible and exposed to the solvent.
   Conclusions: We have defined a multiantigenic epitope vaccine ensemble against the HCMV that should elicit T and B cell responses in the entire population. Importantly, although we arrived to this epitope ensemble with the help of computational predictions, the actual epitopes are not predicted but are known to be immunogenic.

ID UNITED-STATES; PANDEMIC INFLUENZA; SEASON; SURVEILLANCE; DYNAMICS; US
AB Background: Infectious disease forecasting aims to predict characteristics of both seasonal epidemics and future pandemics. Accurate and timely infectious disease forecasts could aid public health responses by informing key preparation and mitigation efforts.
   Main body: For forecasts to be fully integrated into public health decision-making, federal, state, and local officials must understand how forecasts were made, how to interpret forecasts, and how well the forecasts have performed in the past. Since the 2013-14 influenza season, the Influenza Division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has hosted collaborative challenges to forecast the timing, intensity, and short-term trajectory of influenza-like illness in the United States. Additional efforts to advance forecasting science have included influenza initiatives focused on state-level and hospitalization forecasts, as well as other infectious diseases. Using CDC influenza forecasting challenges as an example, this paper provides an overview of infectious disease forecasting; applications of forecasting to public health; and current work to develop best practices for forecast methodology, applications, and communication.
   Conclusions: These efforts, along with other infectious disease forecasting initiatives, can foster the continued advancement of forecasting science.

DE TB- HIV co-infected; TB treatment outcome; Harar
ID PREDICTORS; COHORT
AB Background: The bidirectional relationship between the twin epidemics of Tuberculosis (TB) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) causes major global health challenges in the twenty-first century. TB-HIV co-infected people are facing multifaceted problems like high lost to follow up rates, poor treatment adherence, high TB recurrence rate, and high mortality risk. Our objective was to assess the outcomes of TB treatment and associated factors among TB-HIV co-infected patients in Harar town, Eastern part of Ethiopia, 2018.
   Methods: A retrospective study was conducted among systematically selected 349 TB/HIV co-infected patients who registered from 2012 to 2017 in two public hospitals in Harar town. The data were collected through document review by using a pre-tested structured data extraction checklist. The data were analyzed using SPSS Version 21. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression were determined at 95% confidence intervals.
   Results: Among the 349 TB/HIV co-infected patients included in the study, 30.1% were cured, 56.7% had completed their treatment, 7.7% died, 1.7% were lost to follow up, and 3.7% were treatment failure. Overall, 86.8% of the TB-HIV co-infected patients had successful TB treatment outcomes. The patients who were on re-treatment category (AOR = 2.91, 95% CI: 1.17-7.28), who had a history of opportunistic infection (AOR = 3.68, 95% CI: 1.62-8.33), and who did not take co-trimoxazole prophylaxis (AOR = 3.54, 95% CI: 1.59-7.89) had 2.91, 3.68, and 3.54 times higher odds of having unsuccessful TB treatment outcome than their counterparties, respectively. The chance of unsuccessful TB treatment outcome was 4.46 (95% CI: 1.24-16.02), 5.94 (95% CI: 1.87-18.85), and 3.01 (95% CI: 1.15-7.91) times higher among TB/HIV patients in stage 2, 3 and 4 than those in stage 1, respectively.
   Conclusions: The overall rate of the success of the TB treatment among TB-HIV co-infected patients in this study was higher compared with many previous studies. TB/HIV patients with a history of previous TB treatment, smear-positive pulmonary TB, late HIV stage, history of opportunistic infection and not being on co-trimoxazole prophylaxis therapy were at a high risk of getting poor treatment outcomes.

ID FACILITIES; PREVENTION; MANAGEMENT
AB Background: Healthcare service delivery systems need to ensure standard quality of care (QoC) for achieving expected health outcomes. Although Bangladesh has a good healthcare service delivery system, there are major concerns about the quality of maternal and newborn health (MNH) care services, which is imperative for achievements in health. The study aimed to measure the QoC for different MNH services in two selected public health facilities of Bangladesh. This study also documented the specific areas of each care which needs intervention.
   Methods: The study was conducted in two district-level public health facilities-a district hospital (DH) and a mother and child welfare centre (MCWC). A total of 228 cases of MNH services were observed by using contextualized checklist 'Standards-based Management and Recognition (S-BMR)' for 8 selected MNH care services. For scoring, performed activities were calculated as percentages of the total recommended activities and categorized as high (> 80%), moderate (50 to 80%), and low (< 50%).
   Results: Overall QoC scores were moderate for each DH (54.8%), and MCWC (56.1%). In DH, the QoC score was high for blood transfusion (80.3%); moderate for maternal complications management (77.0%), caesarean section (CS) (65.6%), infection prevention (64.3%), sick newborn care (54.1%), and normal vaginal delivery (NVD) (52.6%); and low for antenatal care (ANC) (25.6%) and postnatal care (PNC) (19.0%). In MCWC, the QoC scores were high for infection prevention (83.0%); moderate for CS (76.5%) and NVD (59.8%); and low for ANC (36.9%) and PNC (24.5%).
   Conclusions: In the study facilities, the QoC for MNH services is found to be unsatisfactory, particularly for ANC and PNC. Urgent initiative needs to be taken by introducing contextualized quality monitoring tools at health facilities, along with training of the care providers and introducing a quality monitoring system.

ID KNOWLEDGE; DISCRIMINATION; ATTITUDES; GENOMICS; IMPACT
AB Background: Many genetic tests are now available due to evolution by the Human Genome Project. However, the growing use of genetic testing and screening may not only lead to improvements in public health and health promotion, but also trigger grave ethical, legal, and societal concerns. The involvement of community healthcare providers is expected in the future because they have direct contact with the residents through their health programs. The aims of the current study were to clarify how public health nurses perceive the relationship between genetics and professional duties and to identify opportunities and challenges of integrating genetics education into their professional duties.
   Methods: In 2017, data were collected through a focus group interview. Content related to the 'presence or absence of health consultation related to genetic issues as part of actual job duties' and 'training for handling genetic-related health consultations' was extracted. Entire sentences were coded and categorized based on similar semantic content.
   Results: Public health nurses had difficulties in recognizing genetic issues in public health activities. In some cases, genetic contents were included in conversation and consultation with the general public. Through the professional education and experiences, public health nurses needed specialized education, post-graduation studies and mentoring about genetics.
   Conclusions: Public health nurses whose professional duties do not directly relate to genetics were exposed to genetics-related episodes on a regular basis without their awareness. The provision of accurate information and knowledge related to genetics by public health nurses would also provide an opportunity for clients to be informed about their latent genetic risks. Hence, there is a need for practical resources, the establishment of collaboration networks, and the development of professional organizations for public health nurses.

AB Background: Majority of the maternal and neonatal adverse events take place during the postnatal period. Provision of high-quality care during this period can minimize these events. Assessment of mothers' perceptions of the quality of care received by them provides valuable feedback to improve the care and ultimately outcomes.
   Methods: A cross sectional survey was conducted in specialized institutions of Colombo district, Sri Lanka, to assess the maternal perceptions of the quality of regular postnatal care and its correlations, using an interviewer administered questionnaire. The questionnaire contained 23 items distributed under three main domains: technical and information domain, interpersonal care domain and ward facilities and cleanliness domain. Each item was given a score from 1 to 5 and total scores were calculated for the total questionnaire and for each domain. Descriptive statistics were used to assess the perceptions and multivariate analysis was conducted to assess the significant correlates of positive perceptions.
   Results: The median score obtained for the questionnaire was 108, (Inter Quartile Range 96-114). The median scores of the technical care and information domain, interpersonal care domain and ward facilities and cleanliness domain were 43 (IQR 38-45), 33 (IQR 30-35) and 32 (IQR 28-35) respectively. Attending teaching/specialized hospitals (aOR= 1.6, p < 0.001), 20-35 age group (1.8, p = 0.024), and services such as initiation of breast feeding within 1 h of delivery (2.1, p = 0.009), pain relief during episiotomy suturing (2.2, p < 0.001), practicing Kangaroo Mother Care (1.4, p = 0.035), receiving health advices by doctors or midwives (2.1, p < 0.001) were significant correlates of positive perceptions.
   Conclusions: Majority of mothers had favourable perceptions of the quality of care received by them. However, the ward facilities and environment domain has obtained lower ratings compared to technical and interpersonal care domains. Several services were significantly associated with favourable perceptions. Authorities should consider these findings when attempting to improve care quality. Further, this assessment should be carried out regularly to obtain more current data.

AB Background: Shigella spp. and entero-invasive E. coli (EIEC) use the same invasive mechanism to cause diarrheal diseases. Public health regulations apply only to Shigella spp. infections, but are hampered by the lack of simple methods to distinguish them from EIEC. In the last decades, molecular methods for detecting Shigella spp. and EIEC were implemented in medical microbiological laboratories (MMLs). However, shigellosis cases identified with molecular techniques alone are not notifiable in most countries. Our study investigates the impact of EIEC versus Shigella spp. infections and molecular diagnosed shigellosis versus culture confirmed shigellosis for re-examination of the rationale for the current public health regulations.
   Methods: In this multicenter cross-sectional study, fecal samples of patients suspected for gastro-enteritis, referred to 15 MMLs in the Netherlands, were screened by PCR for Shigella spp. or EIEC. Samples were cultured to discriminate between the two pathogens. We compared risk factors, symptoms, severity of disease, secondary infections and socio-economic consequences for (i) culture-confirmed Shigella spp. versus culture-confirmed EIEC cases (ii) culture positive versus PCR positive only shigellosis cases.
   Results: In 2016-2017, 777 PCR positive fecal samples with patient data were included, 254 of these were culture-confirmed shigellosis cases and 32 were culture-confirmed EIEC cases. EIEC cases were more likely to report ingestion of contaminated food and were less likely to be men who have sex with men (MSM). Both pathogens were shown to cause serious disease although differences in specific symptoms were observed. Culture-negative but PCR positive cases were more likely report travel or ingestion of contaminated food and were less likely to be MSM than culture-positive cases. Culture-negative cases were more likely to suffer from multiple symptoms. No differences in degree of secondary infections were observed between Shigella spp. and EIEC, and culture-negative and culture-positive cases.
   Conclusions: No convincing evidence was found to support the current guidelines that employs different measures based on species or detection method. Therefore, culture and molecular detection methods for Shigella spp. and EIEC should be considered equivalent for case definition and public health regulations regarding shigellosis. Differences were found regarding risks factors, indicating that different prevention strategies may be required.

AB Background: Health professionals equipped with the adequate skills of helping baby breath remain the backbone in the health system in improving neonatal outcomes. However, there is a great controversy between studies to show the proximate factors of the skills of health care providers in helping babies breathe. In Ethiopia, there is a paucity of evidence on the current status of health care provider's skills of helping babies breathe despite the improvement in neonatal health care services. Therefore, this study intends to fill those gaps in assessing the skills of helping babies breathe and its associated factors among health professionals in public hospitals in Southern Ethiopia.
   Methods: A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 441 health professionals from March 10 to 30, 2019. A simple random sampling method was used to select the study participants. The data were collected through pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaire and observational checklist. A binary logistic regression model was used to identify significant factors for the skills of helping babies breathe by using SPSS version 25. The P-value < 0.05 used to declare statistical significance.
   Results: Overall, 71.1% (95%CI: 66.2, 75.4%) of health professionals had good skills in helping babies breathe. Age group from 25 to 34 (AOR = 2.24; 95%CI: 1.04, 4.81), training on helping babies breathe (AOR = 2.69; 95%CI: 1.49, 4.87), well-equipped facility (AOR = 2.15; 95%CI: 1.09, 4.25), and adequate knowledge on helping babies breathe (AOR = 2.21; 95%CI: 1.25, 3.89) were significantly associated with a health professionals good skill on helping babies breathe.
   Conclusions: Even though a significant number of care providers had good skills in helping babies breathe, yet there is a need to further improve the skills of the provider in helping babies breathe. Hence, health facilities should be equipped with adequate materials and facilitate frequent training to the provider.

TI Drinking beer, wine or spirits - does it matter for inequalities in
   alcohol-related hospital admission? A record-linked longitudinal study
   in Wales
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Alcohol; Deprivation; Inequalities; Beverage type; Record linked;
   Hospital admission
ID LINKAGE
AB Background: Alcohol-related harm has been found to be higher in disadvantaged groups, despite similar alcohol consumption to advantaged groups. This is known as the alcohol harm paradox. Beverage type is reportedly socioeconomically patterned but has not been included in longitudinal studies investigating record-linked alcohol consumption and harm. We aimed to investigate whether and to what extent consumption by beverage type, BMI, smoking and other factors explain inequalities in alcohol-related harm.
   Methods: 11,038 respondents to the Welsh Health Survey answered questions on their health and lifestyle. Responses were record-linked to wholly attributable alcohol-related hospital admissions (ARHA) eight years before the survey month and until the end of 2016 within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. We used survival analysis, specifically multi-level and multi-failure Cox mixed effects models, to calculate the hazard ratios of ARHA. In adjusted models we included the number of units consumed by beverage type and other factors, censoring for death or moving out of Wales.
   Results: People living in more deprived areas had a higher risk of admission (HR 1.75; 95% CI 1.23-2.48) compared to less deprived. Adjustment for the number of units by type of alcohol consumed only reduced the risk of ARHA for more deprived areas by 4% (HR 1.72; 95% CI 1.21-2.44), whilst adding smoking and BMI reduced these inequalities by 35.7% (HR 1.48; 95% CI 1.01-2.17). These social patterns were similar for individual-level social class, employment, housing tenure and highest qualification. Inequalities were further reduced by including either health status (16.6%) or mental health condition (5%). Unit increases of spirits drunk were positively associated with increasing risk of ARHA (HR 1.06; 95% CI 1.01-1.12), higher than for other drink types.
   Conclusions: Although consumption by beverage type was socioeconomically patterned, it did not help explain inequalities in alcohol-related harm. Smoking and BMI explained around a third of inequalities, but lower socioeconomic groups had a persistently higher risk of (multiple) ARHA. Comorbidities also explained a further proportion of inequalities and need further investigation, including the contribution of specific conditions. The increased harms from consumption of stronger alcoholic beverages may inform public health policy.

   EUROPE; CARE
AB Background: The Complementary and Alternative Medicine ( CAM) field in Europe has been a focus of research developments and public health policy changes for years. However, these processes are still in their infancy phase in Bulgaria. In this paper, homeopathy is the investigated CAM-modality at a Bulgarian context. The aim is threefold: 1) to outline the sociodemographic profile of the chronically ill adult patients (>= 18 years old) who choose homeopathic medical treatment (HMT); 2) To identify the patients' sources and needs of information about homeopathy, and the reasons to use HMT; and 3) to measure health-related outcomes in patients who have visited homeopathic clinics to look for HMT of their chronic conditions.
   Methods: A cross-sectional observational multi-centered study (>= 18 years old, n = 211) was conducted between June 2016 to Dec. 2017 in Bulgaria. Potentially eligible participants for the study were all chronically ill patients who had been receiving HMT for a year or more and had visited the homeopathic clinics for a follow up within the study period. The EQ-5D-3L instrument was applied with an additional questionnaire on sociodemographic and health related data.
   Results, discussion and conclusions: The study results outlined the country specific sociodemographic profile of the chronically ill homeopathic patients in Bulgaria: they are predominantly female, with higher education and at the age groups between 30 and 50.
   The EQ-5D-3L version, was applied to measure patients' health-related quality of life and to promote the use of a standardized generic instrument as a complementary and reliable scientific tool to assess the patient-reported outcomes of the homeopathic patients. Regarding the reasons of choice: the participants choose HMT because it is safe and mild, to avoid excessive antibiotic use, because the conventional treatment was not successful, etc. The study confirms the social demand for more scientific information about homeopathy. Participants stated that the medical universities' curriculum should keep pace with the modern CAM-developments. A key message is that the future of the successful chronic disease management is in the integration of the conventional and CAM-modalities and these processes should be facilitated through public health regulations, education and research. The presented study is a supportive action in this direction.

ID WINTER MORTALITY; TEMPERATURE; PATTERNS; DISEASE
AB Background
   Seasonal variability in mortality has been studied in various regions globally. Proper evaluation of seasonally fluctuating mortality is important to establish effective public health measures. We investigated the overall, age-specific, and cause-specific seasonality of deaths in Chitral District in Pakistan.
   Method
   Data on 2577 deaths were provided by the Agha Khan Health Support Program. Seasonal mortality patterns concerning age and causes were examined using the X-12 ARIMA pseudo-additive decomposition method.
   Results
   Of the total deceased, 59.6% were males. The proportion of deceased males was significantly higher than the female (40.4%, p< 0.001). The average age at death was 57.7 years (SD = 28.7). On average, approximately 43 deaths occurred each month. More than 10% of the deaths occurred in children less than 5-years-of-age. Among all the causes of death, the most frequent was cardiovascular disease (n = 666, 25.8%) followed by respiratory disease (n = 482, 18.7%). Significant seasonality in the overall deaths was evident, with a peak in winter. Deaths in people. 55-years-of-age were significantly seasonal and peaked in winter. Deaths due to cardiovascular, respiratory, and kidney related diseases were also significantly seasonal with winter peaks. Further, deaths due to external causes were significantly seasonal with summer peak.
   Conclusion
   In the winter season, all-cause, except external, and age-specific mortality peaks in Chitral District, Pakistan. Deaths due to external causes and cardiovascular, respiratory, and kidney related diseases were significant seasonal effects.

AB Campylobacter species are common foodborne pathogens associated with cases of human gastroenteritis worldwide. A detailed understanding of the prevalence, contamination levels and molecular characteristics of Campylobacter spp. in cattle and chicken, which are likely the most important sources of human contamination, is imperative. A collection of 1243 poultry meat samples (665 chicken breasts and 578 chicken thighs) and 1203 bovine meat samples (689 hamburgers and 514 knife-cut meat preparations) were collected at retail outlets, in randomly selected supermarkets located in different Italian regions during one year. Of these samples, 17.38% of the poultry meat and 0.58% of the bovine meat samples tested positive for Campylobacter, of which 131 were Campylobacter jejuni (57.96%) and 95 were Campylobacter coli (42.03%). Campylobacter isolates were genotyped with the aim of assessing the genetic diversity, population structure, source distribution and Campylobacter transmission route to humans. All isolates were molecularly characterized by pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and further genotyped using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and fla-SVR sequencing to gain better insight into the population structure. Antibiotic resistance was also investigate. The highest levels of resistance among chicken strains were observed for ciprofloxacin (88.25%), nalidixic acid (81.45%) and tetracycline (75.6%). PFGE analysis revealed 73 pulsotypes for C. jejuni and 54 pulsotypes for C. coli, demonstrating the existance of different and specific clones circulating in Italy. MLST of C.jejuni isolates mainly clustered in the CC353, CC354, CC21, CC206 and CC443; while C.coli isolates clustered only in CC828. The most common flaA alleles were 287 for C. jejuni and 66 for C. coli. Our study confirms that poultry meat is the main source of Campylobacteriosis, whereas red meat had a low level of contamination suggesting a minor role in transmission. The high presence of Campylobacter in retail chicken meat, paired with its increased resistance to antimicrobials with several multidrug resistance profiles detected, is alarming and represents a persistent threat to public health.

AB Background Despite advances in the field of pediatric oncology, cancer remains a leading cause of death in children. The delays in cancer diagnosis may occur throughout the diagnostic pathway. Diagnosis of childhood cancer as early as possible is crucial to reduce mortality. The aim of this study was to identify determinants of delayed diagnosis among pediatric cancer patients in Ayder Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northern Ethiopia. Method Facility based cross-sectional study was conducted among pediatric cancer patients aged less than 18 years. Data collection was done by interviewer-administered structured questionnaire from the volunteer primary caregiver from 1st September 2017 to 30th August 2018. The data was checked and cleaned by principal investigator on daily basis during data collection for completeness, consistencies, then coded, entered and analyzed using SPSS version 21 software. Diagnosis delay was considered significant when it is above the 3rd quartile. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to test associations between each of the determinant factors and the dependent variable. Variables with P-value < 0.25 during bivariate analysis were fed to the multivariate logistic regression model. Finally, variables with P-value < 0.05 were considered as determinants of delayed diagnosis. Results From a total of 102 patients, 71(69.6%) had delayed diagnosis. Children older than 10 years of age were four (AOR = 4.01; 95%CI = 1.55-12, P < 0.001) times more likely to get delayed compared to under five children. Rural residence (AOR = 3.3; 95%CI = 1.24-10.24, P < 0.001), uneducated parents (AOR = 3.4; 95%CI = 1.91-13.25, P = 0.009), parents with monthly income less than 1000 ETB (AOR = 6.1; 95%CI = 1.76-7.23, P < 0.001), absence of health insurance (AOR = 2.4; 95%CI = 1.50-3.50, P = 0.02), visit to holy water (AOR = 3.4;95%CI = 1.6-7.2) and those who think cancer is incurable (AOR = 2.7;95%CI = 1.3-14,P = 0.004) were also likely to be delayed. Conclusion Delayed diagnosis of childhood cancer was a major issue and most influenced by the child's age, residency, family's socioeconomic status, parental education, health insurance, use of holy water and caregivers perception on curability of cancer. Thus; every effort should be made to promote public and parental awareness of childhood cancer and promoting health insurance.

TI Magnitude of surgical site infection and its associated factors among
   patients who underwent a surgical procedure at Wolaita Sodo University
   Teaching and Referral Hospital, South Ethiopia
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Introduction
   Surgical site infections are infections that take place within 30 days of an operative procedure. Worldwide, 23% of patients develop surgical site infections among all surgeries annually with the worst complications causing prolonged hospital stays, increased resistance of microorganisms to antimicrobials, higher health system costs, emotional stress for patients and their families, and substantial economic burdens on hospitals. Therefore, this study was created to assess the magnitude and associated factors of surgical site infection at Wolaita Sodo University Teaching and Referral Hospital.
   Method
   We conducted a hospital-based cross-sectional study on patients who underwent a surgical procedure in 2018 at Wolaita Sodo University Teaching and Referral Hospital. We applied a systematic random sampling technique to obtain 261 patient records from all records of surgical patients from January 1, 2018, to December 30, 2018. We collected data using a pretested checklist. We used bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with surgical site infection. We considered a P-value < 0.05 as statistically significant. Summary measures, texts, tables, and figures present the results of the analysis.
   Result
   Among the 261 patients, 34 or 13% (95% CI = 9.2%, 17.2%) developed surgical site infection. Patients younger than 40 years old [AOR 6.45; 95% CI (1.56, 26.67)], illiterate [AOR 4.25; 95% CI (1.52, 11.84)], with a history of previous hospitalization [AOR 4.50; 95% CI (1.44, 14.08)], with a prolonged preoperative hospital stay (>= 7 days) [AOR 3.88; 95% CI (1.46, 10.29)], and admitted to the public wing of the ward [AOR 0.24; 95% CI (0.07, 0.79)] possessed factors associated with surgical site infection.
   Conclusion
   The magnitude of surgical site infection in this study was high. Shortening preoperative hospital stays, delivering intravenous antimicrobial prophylaxis before surgery, and giving wound care as ordered would significantly reduce the incidence of surgical site infection.

TI Anemia and associated factors among type-2 diabetes mellitus patients
   attending public hospitals in Harari Region, Eastern Ethiopia
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID GLOBAL BURDEN; PREVALENCE; RETINOPATHY
AB Background
   Anemia is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, therefore having a major impact on the overall health and survival of diabetic patients. However, there is a paucity of evidence of anemia among diabetic patients in Ethiopia, particularly in Harari Region. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the magnitude of anemia and associated factors among Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients attending public hospitals in Harari Region, Eastern Ethiopia.
   Methods
   A hospital based cross-sectional study was conducted from February 25 to March 30, 2019. Probability proportion to size sampling, followed by simple random sampling, was utilized to select 374 T2DM patients. To collect the data, mixed methods were applied using questionnaires and checklist. Participants were tested for anemia based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Data was double entered to EpiData version 3.1 and exported into Stata version 14.0 for statistical analysis. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were fitted; Crude Odds Ratio (COR) and Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were computed. Level of significance was declared at p-value less than 0.05.
   Results
   The study revealed 34.8% of the participants were anemic (CI: 28.7, 40.9). Being male (AOR = 2.92, CI: 1.65, 5.17), physical inactivity (AOR = 2.58, CI: 1.50, 4.44), having nephropathy (AOR = 2.43, CI: 1.41, 4.21), poor glycemic control (AOR = 1.98, CI: 1.17, 3.34), recent history of blood loss (AOR = 4.41, CI: 1.26, 15.44) and duration of diabetes for five years and greater(AOR = 1.72, CI: 1.01, 2.96)were all significantly associated with anemia.
   Conclusions
   Anemia was a major health problem among T2DM patients in the study area. Therefore, routine screening of anemia for all T2DM patients aiding in early identification and improved management of diabetes will lead to improved quality of life in this patient population.

TI Prevalence of Cryptococcal Antigenemia and associated factors among
   HIV/AIDS patients on second-line antiretroviral therapy at two hospitals
   in Western Oromia, Ethiopia
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   Cryptococcosis is a global public health important infectious disease. HIV infection is the main risk factor estimated to account for 95% of cases in the middle- and low-income countries and 80% of the cases in high-income countries.
   Objective
   The main aim of the study was to determine the prevalence and associated risk factors of Cryptococcal antigenemia (CrAg) among HIV/AIDS Patients on second-line ART Therapy at Ambo General Hospital and Nekemte Referral Hospital, Western Oromia, Ethiopia.
   Materials and methods
   Hospital-based cross-sectional study was employed from September 1, 2017, to October 30, 2017. Whole blood was tested for CrAg using Cryptococcal lateral flow assay (Immuno-Mycologics, Norman, OK, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 software. Binary logistic regression models were applied to assess the association between predictors and outcome variables at 95% CI.
   Result
   Among the study participants, 115(62.8%) were females and the median age of the participants was 35 (IQR: 14) years. Majority, 169(92.3%), have been living with HIV for >= 5.6 years and 124 (67.8%) stayed on 2nd line ART for an average of 2.5 years. The overall prevalence of Cryptococcal antigenemia in the study participants was 7.7% (14/183). Being male [AOR, 95% CI: 4.78(1.14, 20.1)], poor adherence to ART [AOR, 95% CI: 0.12(0.03, 0.4)], occupational exposures to contaminated soil [AOR, 95% CI: 6.81(1.38, 33.4)], having non-separated house from chickens [AOR, 95% CI: 0.06(0.01, 0.51)], CD4 T+ cell levels <= 100 cell/mu L [AOR, 95% CI: 6.57(1.9, 23.3)] and viral load > 1000 copies/mL [AOR, 95% CI: 11.7(2.4, 57.8)] were significant predictors of Cryptococcal antigenemia (P <= 0.05).
   Conclusion
   The prevalence of Cryptococcal Antigenemia was significantly high in this study. Being male, occupational exposure to contaminated soil with avian droppings, CD4+ T cell levels < 100 cell/mu L and viral load > 1000 copies/mL were significant predictors of Cryptococcal antigenemia. Therefore, public health measures, adherence to ART and early treatment are recommended.

TI Frequency and determinants of health care utilization for symptomatic
   reproductive tract infections in rural Indian women: A cross-sectional
   study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS; PRETERM DELIVERY; SEEKING BEHAVIOR; ASSOCIATION;
   PREVALENCE
AB Introduction
   The public health burden of reproductive tract infections (RTIs) among women in rural areas of low-income countries is poorly addressed because health care seeking for treatment of RTIs is inadequate. There are gaps in knowledge about whether low care seeking behavior stems from challenges in accessing health care versus women's recognition of and response to RTI-specific disease symptoms. We aim to identify determinants of care seeking behavior and analyze the difference in utilization of health care resources in response to symptoms of an RTI versus non-RTI disease symptoms in rural India. This will aid in the design of interventions that promote RTI care seeking behavior.
   Methods
   Our analysis uses data from a cross-sectional, population-based surveillance survey among rural, non-pregnant women in Odisha, India, from 2013-2014 (n = 3,600). We utilized bivariate logistic regression to determine the degree that certain determinants are associated with a woman's likelihood to seek RTI treatment, and chi-Squared tests to assess for differences in health care resources used for non-RTI versus RTI symptoms.
   Results
   Married women were significantly more likely to seek health care for RTI symptoms (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.9, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.2-3.0) while unmarried adolescents were less likely to seek treatment (OR = 0.4, CI: 0.2-0.6). There was no association between RTI health care seeking with education level, belief about whether symptoms can be treated, or poverty. The majority (73.8%) of women who did not seek treatment for RTI symptoms reported not seeking treatment because they did not know treatment was needed. Women utilized formal health care providers at a higher rate in response to RTI symptoms than in response to their most recent symptoms of any kind (p = 0.003).
   Conclusions
   Community-based reproductive health education interventions are needed to increase health care seeking behavior for RTIs in rural Indian women. Interventions should target unmarried women and focus on both sexual health education and access to care.

AB Objectives
   The primary aim of this study was to describe the geography of serious mental illness (SMI)-type 2 diabetes comorbidity (T2D) in the Illawarra-Shoalhaven region of NSW, Australia. The Secondary objective was to determine the geographic concordance if any, between the comorbidity and the single diagnosis of SMI and diabetes.
   Methods
   Spatial analytical techniques were applied to clinical data to explore the above objectives. The geographic variation in comorbidity was determined by Moran's I at the global level and the local clusters of significance were determined by Local Moran's I and spatial scan statistic. Choropleth hotspot maps and spatial scan statistics were generated to assess the geographic convergence of SMI, diabetes and their comorbidity. Additionally, we used bivariate LISA (Local Indicators of Spatial Association) and multivariate spatial scan to identify coincident areas with higher rates of both SMI and T2D.
   Results
   The study identified significant geographic variation in the distribution of SMI-T2D comorbidity in Illawarra Shoalhaven. Consistently higher burden of comorbidity was observed in some urban suburbs surrounding the major metropolitan city. Comparison of comorbidity hotspots with the hotspots of single diagnosis SMI and T2D further revealed a geographic concordance of high-risk areas again in the urban areas outside the major metropolitan city.
   Conclusion
   The identified comorbidity hotspots in our study may serve as a basis for future prioritisation and targeted interventions. Further investigation is required to determine whether contextual environmental factors, such as neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage, may be explanatory. Implications for public health Ours is the first study to explore the geographic variations in the distribution of SMI and T2D comorbidity. Findings highlight the importance of considering the role of neighbourhood environments in influencing the T2D risk in people with SMI.

TI Factors that influence patient empowerment in inpatient chronic care:
   early thoughts on a diabetes care intervention in South Africa

   Diabetes; South Africa; Qualitative methods
ID HEALTH-CARE; SELF-MANAGEMENT; CHRONIC DISEASE; CHALLENGES; UNEMPLOYMENT
AB Background: The burden of non-communicable diseases is growing rapidly in low- and middle-income countries. Research suggests that health interventions that aim to improve patient self-management and empower patients to care actively for their disease will improve health outcomes over the long-term. There is, however, a gap in the literature about the potential role of the inpatient setting in supporting chronic care. This is particularly important in low-and-middle income countries where hospitals may be a rare prolonged point of contact between patient and health provider. The aim of this small scale, exploratory study was to understand what factors within the inpatient setting may affect patients' feelings of empowerment in relation to their chronic disease care and provides recommendations for future inpatient-based interventions to support self-management of disease.
   Methods: This study was based in a public, academic hospital in South Africa. Eighteen qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with multiple participants with experience of diabetes care: inpatients and health professionals such as nurses, endocrinologists, and dieticians. Findings were analysed using a broad, exploratory, thematic approach, guided by self-management and chronic care literature.
   Results: Interviews with both patients and providers suggest that patients living in low socio-economic contexts are likely to struggle to access appropriate healthcare information and services, and may often have financial and emotional priorities that take precedence over their chronic illness. Younger people may also be more dependent on their family and community, giving them less ability to take control of their disease care and lifestyle. In addition, hospital care remains bound by an acute care model; and the inpatient setting of focus is characterised by perceived staff shortages and ineffective communication that undermine the implementation of patient empowerment-focused interventions.
   Conclusions: Patient and provider contexts are likely to make supporting patient engagement in long-term chronic care difficult in lower income settings. However, knowledge of these factors can be harnessed to improve chronic care interventions in South Africa and other similar countries.

   NIGRESCENS
AB Background: Microbial culture-based investigations of inflamed tonsil tissues have previously indicated enrichment of several microorganisms such as Streptococcus, Staphylococcus and Prevotella. These taxa were also largely reflected in DNA sequencing studies performed using tissue material. In comparison, less is known about the response of the overall oral cavity microbiota to acute tonsillitis despite their role in human health and evidence showing that their compositions are correlated with diseases such as oral cancers. In addition, the influence of subject-specific circumstances including consumption of prescription antibiotics and smoking habits on the microbiology of acute tonsillitis is unknown.
   Methods: We collected oral rinse samples from 43 individuals admitted into hospital for acute tonsillitis and 165 non-disease volunteers recruited from the public, and compared their microbial community compositions using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We assessed the impact of tonsillitis, whether subjects were prescribed antibiotics, the presence of oral abscesses and their smoking habits on community composition, and identified specific microbial taxa associated with tonsillitis and smoking.
   Results: Oral rinse community composition was primarily associated with disease state (tonsillitis vs non-tonsillitis) although its effect was subtle, followed by smoking habit. Multiple Prevotella taxa were enriched in tonsillitis subjects compared to the non-tonsillitis cohort, whereas the non-tonsillitis cohort primarily showed associations with several Neisseria sequence variants. The presence of oral abscesses did not significantly influence community composition. Antibiotics were prescribed to a subset of individuals in the tonsillitis cohort but we did not observe differences in community composition associated with antibiotics consumption. In both tonsillitis and non-tonsillitis cohorts, smoking habit was associated with enrichment of several Fusobacterium variants.
   Conclusions: These findings show that the oral cavity microbial community is altered during acute tonsillitis, with a consistent enrichment of Prevotella during tonsillitis raising the possibility of targeted interventions. It also supports the possible link between smoking, Fusobacteria and oral cancers.

AB Background: Clear evidence on the benefit-harm balance and cost effectiveness of population-based screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) is missing. We aim to systematically evaluate the long-term effectiveness, harms and cost effectiveness of different organized CRC screening strategies in Austria.
   Methods: A decision-analytic cohort simulation model for colorectal adenoma and cancer with a lifelong time horizon was developed, calibrated to the Austrian epidemiological setting and validated against observed data. We compared four strategies: 1) No Screening, 2) FIT: annual immunochemical fecal occult blood test age 40-75 years, 3) gFOBT: annual guaiac-based fecal occult blood test age 40-75 years, and 4) COL: 10-yearly colonoscopy age 50-70 years. Predicted outcomes included: benefits expressed as life-years gained [LYG], CRC-related deaths avoided and CRC cases avoided; harms as additional complications due to colonoscopy (physical harm) and positive test results (psychological harm); and lifetime costs. Tradeoffs were expressed as incremental harm-benefit ratios (IHBR, incremental positive test results per LYG) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios [ICER]. The perspective of the Austrian public health care system was adopted. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses were performed to assess uncertainty.
   Results: The most effective strategies were FIT and COL. gFOBT was less effective and more costly than FIT. Moving from COL to FIT results in an incremental unintended psychological harm of 16 additional positive test results to gain one life-year. COL was cost saving compared to No Screening. Moving from COL to FIT has an ICER of 15,000 EUR per LYG.
   Conclusions: Organized CRC-screening with annual FIT or 10-yearly colonoscopy is most effective. The choice between these two options depends on the individual preferences and benefit-harm tradeoffs of screening candidates.

AB Background: Questionnaires are valuable data collection instruments in public health research, and can serve to pre-screen respondents for suitability in future studies. Survey non-response leads to reduced effective sample sizes and can decrease representativeness of the study population, so high response rates are needed to minimize the risk of bias. Here we present results on the success of different postal questionnaire strategies at effecting response, and the effectiveness of these strategies at recruiting participants for a field study on the effects of aircraft noise on sleep.
   Methods: In total, we mailed 17 rounds of 240 questionnaires (total n = 4080) to randomly selected households around Atlanta International Airport. Different mailing rounds were varied in the length of the questionnaire (11, 26 or 55 questions), survey incentive (gift card or $2 cash), number of follow-up waves (0, 2 or 3), incentive for participating in a 5-night in-home sleep study ($100, $150 or $200), and address personalization.
   Results: We received completed questionnaires from 407 respondents (response rate 11.4%). Personalizing the address, enclosing a $2 cash incentive with the initial questionnaire mailing and repeated follow-up mailings were effective at increasing response rate. Despite the increased expense of these approaches in terms of each household mailed, the higher response rates meant that they were more cost-effective overall for obtaining an equivalent number of responses. Interest in participating in the field study decreased with age, but was unaffected by the mailing strategies or cash incentives for field study participation. The likelihood that a respondent would participate in the field study was unaffected by survey incentive, survey length, number of follow-up waves, field study incentive, age or sex.
   Conclusions: Pre-issued cash incentives and sending follow-up waves could maximize the representativeness and numbers of people from which to recruit, and may be an effective strategy for improving recruitment into field studies.

   IDENTIFICATION; INFECTION; CARRIAGE; ENGLAND; HERDS
AB Background: Escherichia coli O157 is a bacterial pathogen associated with severe disease in humans for which cattle are an important reservoir of infection. The identification of possible risk factors for infection in cattle could facilitate the development of control strategies and interventions to mitigate the risk to human health. The purpose of this study was to utilize data collected in 2014-2015 during the two contemporaneous cross-sectional surveys of the British E. coli O157 in Cattle Study (BECS) to investigate potential risk factors for E. coli O157 status in cattle destined for the food chain.
   Results: In the England & Wales survey only one variable, herd size, was associated with the outcome farm-level E. coli O157 positive status. The odds increased for each additional animal in the herd. In the Scotland survey, as well as a measure of herd size (the number of cattle aged 12-30 months), having brought breeding females on to the farm in the last year also increased the odds, whereas farms sampled in spring were less likely to be positive compared to those sampled in autumn.
   On the positive farms, in both surveys, an increase in the proportion of pats positive for E. coli O157 was associated with animals being housed at the time of sampling. However, the effect of housing on pat-level prevalence within positive groups was lower on farms from England & Wales than from Scotland (OR 0.45 (95% C.I. 0.24-0.86)).
   Conclusion: For the first time, factors associated with farm-level E. coli O157 status have been investigated in two contemporaneous surveys with comparable study design. Although factors associated with farm-level E. coli O157 status differed between the two surveys, one consistent factor was an association with a measure of herd size. Factors associated with the proportion of E. coli O157 positive pats within a positive farm were similar in both surveys but differed from those associated with farm-level status. These findings raise the hypothesis that measures to protect public health by reducing the risk from cattle may need to be tailored, rather than by assuming that a GB-wide protocol is the best approach.

   Ordinary public school; Family structure

AB Background: Family dissolution has become more common and one third of the child population in most Western countries now experience family dissolution. Studies show that children from dissolved families have lower levels of social well-being than children from intact families, but only few studies have examined the impact on social well-being specifically in the school setting. We investigated the association between family dissolution and children's social well-being at school, including the possible influence of the child's age at the time of the family dissolution.
   Methods: We defined a historic cohort study of 219,226 children and adolescents aged 9-16 years and combined demographic registry data of family structure with questionnaire data on social well-being based on the Danish National Well-being Questionnaire completed in 2015. The definition of social well-being was constructed on the children's perception of sense of belonging in the school setting, in the class and the school community, as well as perceptions on safety, loneliness and bullying. We examined low social well-being according to family dissolution and used multiple logistic regression analyses to adjust for parental educational level, ethnicity and siblings and further stratified for gender and age.
   Results: A total of 5% of the children had a low social well-being at school. Among the 31% who lived in dissolved families, we found more children with a low level of social well-being at school (adjusted OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.36;1.47) than those in intact families; especially among those who at the time of family dissolution were in the preschool age (1.55, 95% CI 1.47;1.64).
   Conclusion: Children from dissolved families had higher odds for low social well-being at school compared with children from intact families, especially those who experienced family dissolution in the preschool age. The school may be an important setting for identifying and providing help and support in children experiencing family dissolution.

TI The role of real-world data in the development of treatment guidelines:
   a case study on guideline developers' opinions about using observational
   data on antibiotic prescribing in primary care
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Clinical practice guidelines; development process; Antibiotic
   prescribing; Evidence-based medicine
AB Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a prominent threat to public health. Although many guidelines have been developed over the years to tackle this issue, their impact on health care practice varies. Guidelines are often based on evidence from clinical trials, but these have limitations, particularly in the breadth and generalisability of the evidence and evaluation of the guidelines' uptake. The aim of this study was to investigate how national and local guidelines for managing common infections are developed and explore guideline committee members' opinions about using real-world observational evidence in the guideline development process.
   Methods: Six semi-structured interviews were completed with participants who had contributed to the development or adjustment of national or local guidelines on antimicrobial prescribing over the past 5 years (from the English National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)). Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data was analysed thematically. This also included review of policy documents including guidelines, reports and minutes of guideline development group meetings that were available to the public.
   Results: Three key themes emerged through our analysis: perception versus actual guideline development process, using other types of evidence in the guideline development process, and guidelines are not enough to change antibiotic prescribing behaviour. In addition, our study was able to provide some insight between the documented and actual guideline development process within NICE, as well as how local guidelines are developed, including differences in types of evidence used.
   Conclusions: This case study indicates that there is the potential for a wider range of evidence to be included as part of the guideline development process at both the national and local levels. There was a general agreement that the inclusion of observational data would be appropriate in enhancing the guideline development process, as well providing a potential solution for monitoring guideline use in clinical practice, and improving the implementation of treatment guidelines in primary care.

TI Inaccuracies in survey reporting of alcohol consumption
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Standard drink; Surveys; Measures; Underestimation; Alcohol
ID RISK DRINKING; IDENTIFICATION; YESTERDAY; COLLEGE; AUDIT
AB Background: Alcohol consumption estimates in public health predominantly rely on self-reported survey data which is likely to underestimate consumption volume. Surveys tend to ask specifically about standard drinks and provide a definition or guide in an effort to gather accurate estimates. This study aimed to investigate whether the inclusion of the term standard drinks with pictorial guide is associated with an adjustment in self-reported alcohol volume.
   Methods: A web-based survey was administered with AUDIT-C questions repeated at the beginning and end of the survey with and without the standard drink term and guide. The order in which respondents were presented with the different question types was randomised. Two cohorts of university/college students in NSW Australia (n = 122) and the US Pacific Northwest (n = 285) completed the survey online.
   Results: Australian students did not adjust their responses to questions with and without the standard drink term and pictorial guide. The US students were more likely to adjust their responses based on the detail of the question asked. Those US students who drank more frequently and in greater volume were less likely to adjust/apply a conversion to their consumption.
   Conclusions: This study supports previous findings of the inaccuracy of alcohol consumption volume in surveys, but also demonstrates that an assumption of underestimation cannot be applied to all individual reports of consumption. Using additional questions to better understand drink types and serving sizes is a potential approach to enable accurate calculation of underestimation in survey data.

ID HEALTH; FAMILIES; HUNGER; EUROPE
AB Background: Diet is an essential determinant of health. Among the health determinants, we find access problems that are summarized as food insecurity. While such food insecurity has been studied in other countries and correlated to several health problems, it has been scarcely assessed in Belgium. The purpose of this work was to determine the factors of food insecurity existing within the Belgian population.
   Method: From November 2016 to February 2017, a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with 19 adults present attending the waiting rooms of six Public Social Action Centers in French-speaking Belgium, analyzed by grounded theory.
   Results: In Belgium, for given food preferences and needs, food insecurity could be summarized as inadequacy between necessary and available resources within two dimensions: at the access level, for financial, temporal, informational, and freedom of action, and at the food use level, for temporal factors, material, knowledge, and skills. In these situations of inadequacy, participants reported finding either strategies to restore balance, or being forced to alter the quality or quantity of their diet.
   Conclusion: While several factors of food insecurity may exist in Belgium, it appears essential that the first line of care these factors into consideration, since they could interfere with care and health, and because the first line of care is ideally placed to inform and refer the patients in question. Several courses of action are proposed in this work, which must still be confirmed by other studies.

TI Papass clinical trial protocol: a multi-component school-based
   intervention study to increase acceptance and adherence to school
   feeding
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Healthy eating; Early intervention; School; Students; Eating behavior
ID FOOD; CHILDREN
AB Background: One of the largest school feeding programs in the world is the National School Feeding Program of Brazil. However, results from the 2012 National School Health Survey indicated that only 22.8% of 9th grade students in Brazilian public school system consumed school meals. The literature presents few studies aiming to promote healthy food consumption in the school environment from interventions, which found inconclusive results. Thus, this study aims to present a protocol to evaluate the effectiveness of multi-component school-level interventions to increase adherence and acceptance to school feeding.
   Methods: School-based multi-component clinical trial with students from 4th-9h grade from 3 municipal schools of Sumidouro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2019. The study design will be parallel, with 3 arms: Control group (without intervention); Intervention group 1 (changes in school environment) and Intervention group 2 (changes in menu and school environment). Interventions in the environment will be based on the principles of choices architecture and, the modification in the dishes that make up the menus offered to the students, on the factors that contribute to poor adherence and acceptance to school feeding, identified by focus groups. Adherence to school feeding will be assessed through a specific question in the questionnaire directed to the frequency of consuming school meals in the week, applied by researchers in three moments. Acceptance will be assessed from the acceptability test application with dishes served to students during the year. Statistical analyses will be performed using generalized linear models, which will be used to assess the impact of the intervention, and will include 3 main variables: intervention, time and the intervention x time interaction.
   Discussion: This study will investigate if the impact of the implementation of interventions in the environment and in the dishes served to students may increase adherence and acceptance to school feeding. Positive results could show the effect of implementing interventions throughout Sumidouro's public school system, as well as throughout the country, aiming to improve the consumption of school meals.

ID POSTTRAUMATIC GROWTH; OF-LIFE; CARE; SITUATION; RISK
AB Background: The directly observed treatment short-course (DOTS) is one of the most effective tuberculosis (TB) control measures worldwide. However, despite its aim of providing comprehensive and humanistic care, few studies have examined its psychological effects from the patient's perspective. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the psychological changes and identify associated factors among patients with TB undergoing the DOTS program in Japan.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited patients with TB receiving the DOTS program via 32 public health centers in four metropolitan cities in Japan. Surveys were administered to the patients and their attending public health or clinical nurses, who were responsible for their care and the DOTS program. Data were collected regarding the patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, post-traumatic growth (using the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory-Short Form [PTGI-SF]), and medication adherence, alongside open-ended questions, from 2014 to 2015. Additionally, the patients' appraisal of the DOTS program's efficacy and nurses' assessment of the program's practices were measured using two original questionnaires. Factors associated with post-traumatic growth were analyzed using variable estimation, correlation analysis, and logistic regression. Thematic analysis was conducted on the open-ended responses.
   Results: Questionnaires were returned by 127 patients (125 valid answers); 98 (78.4%) of the respondents were men. Their mean age was 63.3 (standard deviation: 15.8) years. The mean PTGI-SF score was 21.7 (standard deviation: 11.1). The logistic regression analysis found that post-traumatic growth was significantly associated with the patients' appraisal of the program's efficacy (odds ratio [OR] = 1.157, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.026-1.304) and nurses' assessment of the practices (OR = 1.307, 95% CI = 1.065-1.603). In the qualitative analysis, "Non-acceptance," "Frustration," and "Anxiety" were extracted as barriers to treatment; "Fear," "Acquiring a partner," "Relief," and "Belief" were extracted as treatment drivers; and "Life changes" and "Rebuilding oneself" were extracted as treatment outcomes.
   Conclusions: The DOTS program in Japan improves patients' treatment adherence and leads to recovery and psychological growth. Even in other regions, it may be effective to incorporate this program's practices that place importance on partnerships with patients. It is also necessary to continue refined quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

AB Advocates for a One Health approach recognize that global health challenges require multidisciplinary collaborative efforts. While past publications have looked at interdisciplinary competency training for collaboration, few have identified the factors and conditions that enable operational One Health. Through a scoping review of the literature, a multidisciplinary team of researchers analyzed peer-reviewed publications describing multisectoral collaborations around infectious disease-related health events. The review identified 12 factors that support successful One Health collaborations and a coordinated response to health events across three levels: two individual factors (education & training and prior experience & existing relationships), four organizational factors (organizational structures, culture, human resources and, communication), and six network factors (network structures, relationships, leadership, management, available & accessible resources, political environment). The researchers also identified the stage of collaboration during which these factors were most critical, further organizing into starting condition or process-based factors. The research found that publications on multisectoral collaboration for health events do not uniformly report on successes or challenges of collaboration and rarely identify outputs or outcomes of the collaborative process. This paper proposes a common language and framework to enable more uniform reporting, implementation, and evaluation of future One Health collaborations.

AB With approximately half of the world's population at risk of contracting dengue, this mosquito-borne disease is of global concern. International travellers significantly contribute to dengue's rapid and large-scale spread by importing the disease from endemic into nonendemic countries. To prevent future outbreaks and dengue from establishing in nonendemic countries, knowledge about the arrival time and location of infected travellers is crucial. We propose a network model that predicts the monthly number of dengue-infected air passengers arriving at any given airport. We consider international air travel volumes to construct weighted networks, representing passenger flows between airports. We further calculate the probability of passengers, who travel through the international air transport network, being infected with dengue. The probability of being infected depends on the destination, duration and timing of travel. Our findings shed light onto dengue importation routes and reveal country-specific reporting rates that have been until now largely unknown. This paper provides important new knowledge about the spreading dynamics of dengue that is highly beneficial for public health authorities to strategically allocate the often limited resources to more efficiently prevent the spread of dengue.

AB Changes in eating behavior of adolescents are associated with high consumption of processed and ultra-processed foods. This study evaluated the association between these foods and the prevalence of inadequate micronutrient intake in adolescents. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 444 adolescents from public schools in the city of Natal, northeastern Brazil. The adolescents' habitual food consumption was evaluated using two 24-hour dietary recalls. Foods were categorized according to the degree of processing (processed and ultra-processed) and distributed into energy quartiles, using the NOVA classification system. Inadequacies in micronutrient intake were assessed using the estimated average requirement (EAR) as the cutoff point. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the relationship between energy percentage from processed and ultra-processed foods and prevalence of inadequate micronutrient intake. The mean (Standard Deviation (SD)) consumption of total energy from processed foods ranged from 5.8% (1.7%) in Q1 to 20.6% (2.9%) in Q4, while the mean consumption of total energy from ultra-processed foods ranged from 21.4% (4.9%) in Q1 to 61.5% (11.7%) in Q4. The rates of inadequate intake of vitamin D, vitamin E, folate, calcium, and selenium were above 80% for both sexes across all age groups. Energy consumption from processed foods was associated with higher prevalence of inadequate selenium intake (p < 0.01) and lower prevalence of inadequate vitamin B1 intake (p = 0.04). Energy consumption from ultra-processed foods was associated with lower prevalence of inadequate zinc and vitamin B1 intake (p < 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively). An increase in the proportion of energy obtained from processed and ultra-processed foods may reflect higher prevalence of inadequate selenium intake and lower prevalence of vitamin B1 and zinc inadequacy.

TI Prevalence of dental caries and its association with body mass index
   among school-age children in Shenzhen, China
SO BMC ORAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID ORAL-HEALTH; CHILDHOOD OBESITY; OVERWEIGHT; ADOLESCENTS
AB Background: Dental caries and overweight/obesity are health problems with shared risk factors, but the relationships between caries and BMI need to be further explored. The objective was to evaluate the current status of dental caries and the association between dental caries and Body Mass Index (BMI) among primary and secondary school students in Shenzhen, China, during the 2016-2017 academic year.
   Methods: A population-based, cross-sectional study that enrolled a total of 1,196,004 students was conducted in Shenzhen. Physical and dental examinations were given to all primary and secondary school students by certified physicians and dentists following the national specification for student health examinations, and dental caries was diagnosed using WHO criteria. Descriptive analysis was applied to assess current oral health status and a multifactorial, logistic regression model was employed to evaluate the relationship between dental caries and obesity.
   Results: A total of 1,196,004 students participated in the census. Mean age of the participants was 10.3 years, ranging from 6 to 20 years. The prevalence of dental caries was 41.15% in the present study, which was higher among girls (42.88%) than that in boys (39.77%) with a p-value of < 0.001. Students in public schools showed a significantly lower (p < 0.001) caries prevalence (37.36%) compared with those in private schools (47.96%). The caries restoration rate of students in Shenzhen was only 10.30%, which means only one out of ten students with caries received restorations. The mean dmft and DMFT scores were 0.97 and 0.33, respectively. More girls (10.96%) had their teeth filled than boys (9.78%). The restoration rate was higher (p < 0.001) in public schools (11.73%) than in private ones (8.35%). Children who were overweight or obese had a lower risk of experiencing caries compared to those who were within a normal weight (OR = 0.74/0.64). Caries was inversely associated with BMI among primary and secondary school students in Shenzhen.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of dental caries among primary and secondary school children was found to be related to sex, type of schools, region, and BMI. Further studies and more government support are required to confirm the findings of this study and to address current oral health problems.

ID BIPOLAR DISORDER; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PERCEPTIONS; PSYCHOSIS; STIGMA; SCALE
AB Background: People with severe mental illness (SMI) living in low and middle-income countries can experience extended delays to diagnosis, which hinder access to medical treatment. The aims of this study were to describe the interval to diagnosis among these people in rural Vietnam and its associated factors.
   Methods: A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted among people with SMI in two provinces in Vietnam. The delay to diagnosis was defined as the time between the first abnormal behaviour being observed by family members and the formal diagnosis of psychosis. A multilevel linear regression was used to examine the factors associated with the delay to diagnosis.
   Results: Among 404 people with SMI from 370 households, the median delay to diagnosis was 11.5 months (IQR 0-168.0). Overall, 53.7% had a delay to diagnosis of less than one year (95% CI: 48.81-58.54). The financial burden of these people on their families was nearly USD 470/year. After adjusting for other factors at individual and household levels, living in a Northern province; older age, and having psychotic diagnosis before the implementation of the National Community Mental Health program (2003) were associated with a delay of more than twelve months to diagnosis.
   Conclusions: These data indicate that the implementation of a national policy for community-based care has been effective in reducing the delay to diagnosis in rural Vietnam. Therefore, there is a need for strengthening the program and mental health policies, focusing on public communication to improve mental health literacy and reduce stigma against SMI.

AB Background: Tuberculosis remains a major public health challenge globally with increasing risks for inter-transmission between pastoralists and cattle in Nigeria. This study was aimed at using molecular tools to establish zoonotic transmission of tuberculosis between pastoralists and their cattle in Ebonyi State, Nigeria. Sputum (n = 149) and milk (n = 144) samples from pastoralists and cattle, respectively were screened on the assumption of subclinical infections considering unguarded human-livestock interactions. Isolates obtained were analysed using deletion typing, spoligotyping and 24-Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Unit-Variable Number Tandem Repeats (MIRU-VNTR).
   Results: Fifty-four MTC were confirmed by deletion typing and were differentiated accordingly (M. tuberculosis: pastoralists = 42, cattle = 2; M. bovis: pastoralists =1; M. africanum: pastoralists = 9). Spoligotyping indicated 59.2% Uganda I/SIT46 (pastoralists = 28; cattle = 1), 16.3% Latin American Mediterranean/SIT61 (pastoralists = 8), 2.0% T/SIT53 (pastoralists = 1) strains of M. tuberculosis and new strains of M. bovis and M. africanum. The 24-MIRU-VNTR of selected predominant cluster isolates shared by cattle and pastoralists (Uganda I/SIT46: pastoralists = 9; cattle = 1) showed the same number of copies at each of the repetitive loci.
   Conclusions: Mycobacterium bovis was confirmed in humans and a reverse zoonotic tuberculosis transmission from an emerging Uganda I M. tuberculosis strain between pastoralists and cattle in Nigeria evidenced by MIRU-VNTR. Using molecular tools will help mitigate disease burden through informed epidemiological insights.

DT Article
DE Malaria; Clinical audit; Case management; Public-private partnership
AB Background: Malaria is one of the leading public health problems in sub-Saharan Africa that contributes to significant patient morbidity and mortality. The aim of the study was to investigate adherence to malaria diagnosis and treatment guidelines by private health sector providers and compare their performance against the public private partnership (PPP) status.
   Methods: A facility-based retrospective clinical audit was conducted between October 2016 and January 2017 in 11 medium clinics in the West Gojjam zone of the Amhara Region, North-west Ethiopia. Data was extracted from patient medical records using pretested data abstraction forms. Descriptive statistics were employed to present the findings and adherence of health workers against the national and international standards were classified as ideal, acceptable, minor error and major error for both malaria diagnosis and treatment. A chi-square (X-2) test was used to test for a statistically significant relationship after the data had been categorized using public private partnership status at P < 0.05.
   Results: One thousand six hundred fifty clinical files were audited. All malaria suspected patients were investigated either with microscopy or rapid diagnostics test (RDT) for parasitological confirmation. The proportion of malaria treated cases was 23.7% (391/1650). Of which 16.6% (274/1650) were uncomplicated, 3.69% (61/1650) were severe and complicated and the rest 3.39% (56/1650) were clinical diagnosed malaria cases. And the malaria parasite positivity rate was 20.30% (335/1650). All malaria suspected patients were not investigated with ideal malaria diagnosis recommendations; only 19.4% (320/1650) were investigated with acceptable malaria diagnosis (public private partnership (PPP) 19.4%; 176/907; and non-public private partnership (NPPP) 19.38%; 144/743, X-2 (1) = 0.0With regards to treatments of malaria cases, the majority 82.9% of Plasmodium vivax cases were managed with ideal recommended treatment (X-2 (1) = 0.35, P = 0.55); among Plasmodium falciparum, mixed (Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax).
   Conclusion: The clinical audit revealed that the majority of malaria patients had received minor error malaria diagnostic services. In addition, only one fifth of malaria patients had received ideal malaria treatment services. To understand the reasons for the low levels of malaria diagnosis and treatment adherence with national guidelines, a qualitative exploratory descriptive study is recommended.

TI Barriers to chronic Hepatitis B treatment and care in Ghana: A
   qualitative study with people with Hepatitis B and healthcare providers
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID VIRAL-HEPATITIS; KNOWLEDGE; MANAGEMENT; INFECTION; EPIDEMIC; IMPACT
AB Background
   Hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection remains an important public health concern particularly in Africa. Between 1990 and 2013, Hepatitis B mortality increased by 63%. In recent times, effective antiviral agents against HBV such as Nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) are available. These drugs are capable of suppressing HBV replication, preventing progression of chronic Hepatitis B to cirrhosis, and reducing the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related death. Notwithstanding, these treatments are underused despite their effectiveness in managing Hepatitis B. This study sought to explore barriers to treatment and care for people with Hepatitis B (PWHB) in Ghana, paying particular attention to beliefs about aetiology that can act as a barrier to care for PWHB.
   Methods
   We used an exploratory qualitative design with a purposive sampling technique. Face-toface interviews were conducted for 18 persons with Hepatitis B (PWHB) and 15 healthcare providers (HCP; physicians, nurses, and midwives). In addition, four focus group discussions (FGD) with a composition of eight HCPs in each group were done. Participants were recruited from one tertiary and one regional hospital in Ghana. Data were processed using QSR Nvivo version 10.0 and analysed using the procedure of inductive thematic analysis. Participants were recruited from one tertiary and one regional hospital in Ghana.
   Results
   Three main cultural beliefs regarding the aetiology of chronic Hepatitis B that act as barriers to care and treatment were identified. These were: (1) the belief that chronic Hepatitis B is a punishment from the gods to those who touch dead bodies without permission from their landlords, (2) the belief that bewitchment contributes to chronic Hepatitis B, and (3) the belief that chronic Hepatitis B is caused by spiritual poison. Furthermore, individual level barriers were identified. These were the absence of chronic Hepatitis B signs and symptoms, perceived efficacy of traditional herbal medicine, and PWHB's perception that formal care does not meet their expectations. Health system-related barriers included high cost of hospital-based care and inadequate Hepatitis B education for patients from HCPs.
   Conclusion
   Given that high cost of hospital based care was considered an important barrier to engagement in care for PWHB, we recommend including the required Hepatitis B laboratory investigations such as viral load, and the recommended treatment in the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). Also, we recommend increasing health care providers and PWHB Hepatitis B knowledge and capacity in a culturally sensitive fashion, discuss with patients (1) myths about aetiology and the lack of efficacy of traditional herbal medicines, and (2) patients' expectations of care and the need to monitor even in the absence of symptoms.

AB As infectious disease outbreaks emerge, public health agencies often enact vaccination and social distancing measures to slow transmission. Their success depends on not only strategies and resources, but also public adherence. Individual willingness to take precautions may be influenced by global factors, such as news media, or local factors, such as infected family members or friends. Here, we compare three modes of epidemiological decision-making in the midst of a growing outbreak using network-based mathematical models that capture plausible heterogeneity in human contact patterns. Individuals decide whether to adopt a recommended intervention based on overall disease prevalence, the proportion of social contacts infected, or the number of social contacts infected. While all strategies can substantially mitigate transmission, vaccinating (or self isolating) based on the number of infected acquaintances is expected to prevent the most infections while requiring the fewest intervention resources. Unlike the other strategies, it has a substantial herd effect, providing indirect protection to a large fraction of the population.

AB Introduction
   Surveillance of physical activity at the population level increases the knowledge on levels and trends of physical activity, which may support public health initiatives to promote physical activity. Physical activity assessed by accelerometry is challenged by varying data processing procedures, which influences the outcome. We aimed to describe the levels and prevalence estimates of physical activity, and to examine how triaxial and uniaxial accelerometry data influences these estimates, in a large population-based cohort of Norwegian adults.
   Methods
   This cross-sectional study included 5918 women and men aged 40-84 years who participated in the seventh wave of the Tromso Study (2015-16). The participants wore an ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometer attached to the hip for 24 hours per day over seven consecutive days. Accelerometry variables were expressed as volume (counts.minute(-1) and steps.day(-1)) and as minutes per day in sedentary, light physical activity and moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA).
   Results
   From triaxial accelerometry data, 22% (95% confidence interval (CI): 21-23%) of the participants fulfilled the current global recommendations for physical activity (>= 150 minutes of MVPA per week in >= 10-minute bouts), while 70% (95% CI: 69-71%) accumulated >= 150 minutes of non-bouted MVPA per week. When analysing uniaxial data, 18% fulfilled the current recommendations (i.e. 20% difference compared with triaxial data), and 55% (95% CI: 53-56%) accumulated.150 minutes of non-bouted MVPA per week. We observed approximately 100 less minutes of sedentary time and 90 minutes more of light physical activity from triaxial data compared with uniaxial data (p< 0.001).
   Conclusion
   The prevalence estimates of sufficiently active adults and elderly are more than three times higher (22% vs. 70%) when comparing triaxial bouted and non-bouted MVPA. Physical activity estimates are highly dependent on accelerometry data processing criteria and on different definitions of physical activity recommendations, which may influence prevalence estimates and tracking of physical activity patterns over time.

AB Background: World population is living longer, demanding adjustments in public health policies. Body mass index (BMI) is widely known and used as a parameter and predictor of health status although an adapted criterion for older adults is usually overlooked. BMI has been extensively analysed in relation to mortality but fewer studies address its association with cognition, functioning and depression in older adults. The present study aimed at 1) comparing BMI distribution according to the ranges proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States National Research Council Committee on Diet and Health (CDH), 2) analysing their association with cognitive functioning, physical functioning and depression and 3) analysing a possible, interaction of BMI criteria with sex on the outcome measures.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study included 395 participants recruited by convenience sampling; 283 (71.6%) women and 112 (24.58%) men. Mean age was 74.68 (SD = 8.50, range: 60-98). Outcome measures included the Short Portable Mental State Questionnaire for cognitive status, the Barthel's Index of Activities of Daily Living for physical functioning, and the Geriatric Depression Scale.
   Results: WHO criterion classified most cases (65.3%) as overweight, followed by normal weight (32.2%) and underweight (2.5%) whereas CDH criterion considered most (48.1%) as normal weight, and followed by overweight (31.4%) and underweight (20.5%). Analysing cognitive status, independent physical functioning and depression mean scores, significant differences (p = .001) were found when comparing the three weight groups (underweight, normal weight and overweight) using either the WHO- or the CDH criterion. Post-hoc tests revealed that in all comparisons the underweight group scored the lowest in all three outcome measures. According to the CDH criterion, overweight was favourable for females but unfavourable for males regarding cognitive status (interaction F(2,389) = 4.52, p = .01) and independent functioning (interaction F(2,389) = 3.86, p = .05).
   Conclusions: BMI and its associations to relevant outcome measures in the older adults must rely on criteria that take into account the particular features of this population, such as the CDH criterion. Underweight was associated with decremented cognition, less independent physical functioning and more depression. Overweight seemed favourable for women but unfavourable for men.

AB Background: Viral hepatitis is a global public health problem affecting millions of people worldwide, causing thousands of deaths due to acute and persistent infection, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Providing updated serologic data can improve both surveillance and disease control programs. This study is aimed to determine the seroprevalence of markers for viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D and E) and the epidemiology of such infections in the general population of southern Iran's Hormozgan province.
   Methods: Between 2016 and 2017, a total of 562 individuals with ages ranging from 1 to 86 years, who visited governmental public laboratories for routine check-ups, were tested for the presence of serological markers to hepatitis virus types A to E using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.
   Results: The overall anti-hepatitis A virus (HAV) antibody seroprevalence was 93.2% (524/562). The prevalence of anti-hepatitis E virus (HEV) antibodies was 15.8% (89/562) among which 1.6% (9/562) of the seropositive individuals also had evidence of recent exposure to the virus (IgM positivity). Two and a half percent (14/562) were positive for hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen, whereas 11.6% (65/562) tested positive for anti-hepatitis B core (HBc) antibodies. Among anti-HBc positive patients, 11% (7/65) had HBs Ag and 5% (3/65) were positive for anti-hepatitis D virus (HDV) antibodies. The prevalence of anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies was 0.7% (4/562). The seroprevalence of anti-HAV, HEV IgG, anti-HBc antibodies, and HBs Ag increased with age.
   Conclusion: The present study confirms a high seroprevalence of HAV infection among the examined population and reveals high levels of endemicity for HEV in the region. Planned vaccination policies against HAV should be considered in all parts of Iran. In addition, improvements on public sanitation and hygiene management of drinking water sources for the studied area are recommended.

AB Background: The presence of nosocomial pathogens in many intensive care units poses a threat to patients and public health worldwide. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important pathogen endemic in many hospital settings. Patients who are colonized with MRSA may develop an infection that can complicate their prior illness.
   Methods: A mathematical model to describe transmission dynamics of MRSA among high-risk and low-risk patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) via hands of health care workers is developed. We aim to explore the effects of the proportion of high-risk patients, the admission proportions of colonized and infected patients, the probability of developing an MRSA infection, and control strategies on MRSA prevalence among patients.
   Results: The increasing proportion of colonized and infected patients at admission, along with the higher proportion of high-risk patients in an ICU, may significantly increase MRSA prevalence. In addition, the prevalence becomes higher if patients in the high-risk group are more likely to develop an MRSA infection. Our results also suggest that additional infection prevention and control measures targeting high-risk patients may considerably help reduce MRSA prevalence as compared to those targeting low-risk patients.
   Conclusions: The proportion of high-risk patients and the proportion of colonized and infected patients in the high-risk group at admission may play an important role on MRSA prevalence. Control strategies targeting high-risk patients may help reduce MRSA prevalence.

DE Hand; foot; and mouth disease; Case-crossover; Weather effect
ID TEMPERATURE; PROVINCE; CHILDREN
AB Background: Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) raises an urgent public health issue in the Asia-Pacific region, especially in China. The associations between weather factors and HFMD have been widely studied but with inconsistent results. Moreover, previous studies utilizing ecological design could not rule out the bias of exposure misclassification and unobserved confounders.
   Methods: We used case-crossover analysis to assess the associations of weather factors on HFMD. Individual HFMD cases from 2009 to 2012 in Guangdong were collected and cases located within 10 km of the meteorological monitoring sites were included. Lag effects were examined through the previous 7 days. In addition, we explored the variability by changing the distance within 20 km and 30 km.
   Results: We observed associations between HFMD and weather factors, including temperature and relative humidity. An approximately U-shaped relationship was observed for the associations of temperature on HFMD across the same day and the previous 7 days, while an approximately exponential-shaped was seen for relative humidity. Statistically significant increases in rates of HFMD were associated with each 10-unit increases in temperature [Excess rate (ER): 7.7%; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 3.9, 11.7%] and relative humidity (ER: 1.9%; 95% CI: 0.7, 3.0%) on lag days 0-6, when assessing within 10 km of the monitoring sites. Potential thresholds for temperature (30.0 degrees C) and relative humidity (70.3%) detected showed associations with HFMD. The associations remained robust for 20 km and 30 km.
   Conclusions: Our study found that temperature and relative humidity are significantly associated with the increased rates of HFMD. Thresholds and lag effects were observed between weather factors and HFMD. Our findings are useful for planning on targeted prevention and control of HFMD.

AB Background: Previous research has documented mental health status among rural-to-urban migrant children (labeled as "migrant children" henceforth) and urban children. However, the findings remain unclear. In addition, far less attention has been paid to rural children's psychological outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare mental health status among migrant, urban and rural school-age children in Guangdong Province, China.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study involving 372 migrant, 254 urban and 268 rural children selected respectively from 3 private schools, 4 public schools and 2 village schools in Guangdong Province, China. Participants provided their socio-demographic information and completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to assess mental health. One-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) and Bonferroni post hoc test were used to evaluate SDQ scores differences. A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to measure mental health differences among children after controlling for socio-demographics. Chi-square analyses were used to assess differences in the prevalence of mental health problems among children.
   Results: Bonferroni post hoc test showed that migrant and rural children reported significantly higher scores than urban peers in emotional symptoms, hyperactivity/inattention and total difficulties score (p < 0.01). In addition, migrant children reported a higher peer problems score compared to urban children (p < 0.001). In multiple linear regression analysis, rural and migrant children reported significantly a higher total difficulties score than urban children (p = 0.046 and 0.024, respectively). Additionally, female gender, having insurance, seldom communicating with parents, and higher monthly household income were negatively associated with a higher total difficulties score. Conversely, children's father with secondary education was positively associated with a higher total difficulties score. The prevalence of mental health problems among rural, migrant and urban children were 26.5, 18.8 and 15.0% (chi(2) = 11.41, p = 0.003), respectively.
   Conclusions: Rural and migrant children reported poorer mental health than urban children. Female gender, having insurance, seldom communicating with parents, and higher monthly household income were associated with better mental health of children. However, children's father with secondary education was associated with poorer mental health of children. Given the different effects of socio-demographics, further support might be provided accordingly to improve the mental health of school-age children.

AB Background: Colonoscopy as a screening and diagnostic tool is generally safe and well-tolerated, and significant complications are rare. The rate of more mild adverse effects is difficult to estimate, particularly when such effects do not result in hospital admission. We aimed to identify the rate and timing of adverse effects as reported by users querying symptoms on an internet search engine.
   Methods: We identified queries made to Bing originating from users in the United States containing the word "colonoscopy" during a 12-month period and identified those queries in which the timing of colonoscopy could be estimated. We then identified queries from those same users for medical symptoms during the time span from 5 days before through 30 days after the colonoscopy date.
   Results: Of 641,223 users mentioning colonoscopy, 7013 (1.1%) had a query that enabled identification of their colonoscopy date. The majority of queries about colonoscopy preceded the procedure, and concerned diet. 28% of colonoscopy-related queries were made afterwards, and included queries about diarrhea and cramps, with 2.6% of users querying respiratory symptoms after the procedure, including cough (1.2%) and pneumonia (0.6%). Respiratory symptoms rose significantly at days 7-10 after the colonoscopy.
   Conclusions: Internet search queries for respiratory symptoms rose approximately one week after queries relating to colonoscopy, raising the possibility that such symptoms are an under-reported late adverse effect of the procedure. Given the widespread use of colonoscopy as a screening modality and the rise of anesthesia-assisted colonoscopy in the United States in recent years, this signal is of potential public health concern.

ID INTERVENTION
AB Background: The wide scale and severity of consequences of tobacco use, benefits derived from cessation, low rates of intervention by healthcare professionals, and new opportunities stemming from novel communications technologies are the main factors motivating this project. Thus, the purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of an intervention that helps people cease smoking and increase their nicotine abstinence rates in the long term via a chat-bot, compared to usual practice, utilizing a chemical validation at 6 months.
   Methods: Design: Randomized, controlled, multicentric, pragmatic clinical trial, with a 6-month follow-up. Setting: Healthcare centers in the public healthcare system of the Community of Madrid (Madrid Regional Health Service). Participants: Smokers > 18 years of age who attend a healthcare center and accept help to quit smoking in the following month. N = 460 smokers (230 per arm) who will be recruited prior to randomization. Intervention group: use of a chat-bot with evidence-based contents to help quit smoking. Control group: Usual treatment (according to the protocol for tobacco cessation by the Madrid Regional Health Service Main variable: Continuous nicotine withdrawal with chemical validation (carbon monoxide in exhaled air). Intention-to-treat analysis. Difference between groups in continuous abstinence rates at 6 months with their corresponding 95% confidence interval. A logistic regression model will be built to adjust for confounding factors. Results: First expected results in January 2020.
   Discussion: Providing science-based evidence on the effectiveness of clinical interventions via information technologies, without the physical presence of a professional, is essential. In addition to being more efficient, the characteristics of these interventions can improve effectiveness, accessibility, and adherence to treatment. From an ethics perspective, this new type of intervention must be backed by scientific evidence to circumvent pressures from the market or particular interests, improve patient safety, and follow the standards of correct practices for clinical interventions.

AB Background: Enabling patients to be active users of their own medical records may promote the delivery of safe, efficient care across settings. Patients are rarely involved in designing digital health record systems which may make them unsuitable for patient use. We aimed to develop an evidence-based electronic health record (EHR) interface and participatory design process by involving patients and the public.
   Methods: Participants were recruited to multi-step workshops involving individual and group design activities. A mixture of quantitative and qualitative questionnaires and observational methods were used to collect participant perspectives on interface design and feedback on the workshop design process.
   Results: 48 recruited participants identified several design principles and components of a patient-centred electronic medical record interface. Most participants indicated that an interactive timeline would be an appropriate way to depict a medical history. Several key principles and design components, including the use of specific colours and shapes for clinical events, were identified. Participants found the workshop design process utilised to be useful, interesting, enjoyable and beneficial to their understanding of the challenges of information exchange in healthcare.
   Conclusion: Patients and the public should be involved in EHR interface design if these systems are to be suitable for use by patient-users. Workshops, as used in this study, can provide an engaging format for patient design input. Design principles and components highlighted in this study should be considered when patient-facing EHR design interfaces are being developed.

   Feline welfare; Preventative; Multicat; Overpopulation
ID HEALTH; BEHAVIOR; ANIMALS; OWNERS
AB Background: Thousands of injured, stray and relinquished cats are received at the RSPCA Greater Manchester Animal Hospital each year. A significant and challenging proportion of these cats are confiscated from multicat households by RSPCA Inspectors, due to the owners' inability to care for them. These households share many characteristics of animal hoarding, including poor owner compliance with suggested welfare improvements and recidivism. The relatively poor adoption potential of animals from such households are a perennial problem for the charity.
   The aim of this study was to determine if offering female cat neutering assistance to multi-cat owners significantly improved colony welfare.
   Results: Ten multicat households with a history of public complaint to the RSPCA were recruited. An RSPCA veterinary surgeon (VS) initially assessed the overall welfare of each household's cat population, individual cat welfare and the living environment. All entire female cats aged over 8 weeks were neutered and basic animal care education provided. Follow up visits were completed two and 12 months later to reassess welfare parameters and population numbers.
   The total number of cats was 176 across ten households (range 7-33, median 16). All owners consented to having all entire female cats spayed. At the first visit, mean individual cat welfare scores ranged from 5.4-8.7/16 across the 10 households, where 16 represented best possible welfare.
   Overall household mean welfare scores were significantly improved at both the 2 month and 12 month revisits (p = 0.011 and p = 0.01 respectively) when compared to the initial visits. By the end of the study period, three out of the ten households had voluntarily relinquished all of their cats, and overall there was a 40% reduction in the number of cats.
   Conclusions: Animal hoarding has previously been an intractable welfare concern with little evidence informing intervention techniques. These results show that positive veterinary engagement on site, focused on preventative care and population control, can yield significant improvement in welfare scoring systems in relatively short timescales. Promptly collecting and neutering all female cats at a site, combined with advice and support, show promise in improving welfare.

AB Background: Higher incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is a global health problem requiring attention of all stakeholders regardless of the practice settings. This study therefore aimed to evaluate awareness, knowledge, attitude and practice of ADR reporting among health workers and patients in 10 primary healthcare centres (PHCs) in Ibadan, southwestern Nigeria.
   Methods: Questionnaire-guided cross-sectional survey among 80 health workers and 360 patients enrolled from the selected PHCs between October and December 2018. The semi-structured questionnaires generally comprised open-ended and closed-ended questions to explore general knowledge and awareness of ADRs and pharmacovigilance, while other question-items evaluated attitude towards ADR reporting and ADR reporting practice. Overall percent score in the knowledge and attitude domains for the health workers was developed into binary categories of > 80 versus <= 80% for "adequate" and "inadequate" knowledge, as well as "positive" and "negative" attitude, respectively. Data were summarised using descriptive statistics, while Chi-square test was used to evaluate categorical variables at p < 0.05.
   Results: Overall, 58(72.5%) health workers had heard of pharmacovigilance, but only 3(5.2%) correctly understood the pharmacovigilance concept. Twelve (15.0%) showed adequate knowledge of ADRs, while 37(46.2%) demonstrated positive attitude towards ADR reporting. Thirty (37.5%) health workers had come across ADR reporting form, while 79(98.8%) expressed willingness to report all ADRs encountered. Of the patients, 31(8.6%) had heard of pharmacovigilance, 143(39.7%) correctly cited ADR definition, while 67(18.6%) reported the previously experienced ADRs. Informing healthcare professional (38; 38.8%) was the most common measure taken by patients when they experienced reaction(s). Nurses significantly had adequate knowledge of ADRs (p < 0.001) compared to other cadres.
   Conclusions: Health workers in the selected PHCs were largely aware of pharmacovigilance but show low level of knowledge about ADRs and pharmacovigilance concept, with moderately positive attitude towards ADR reporting. Patients on the other hand demonstrate low level of awareness of pharmacovigilance and ADR reporting, with less than one-fifth who reported the previously experienced ADRs. This perhaps underscores a need for regular mandatory education and training on ADRs/pharmacovigilance concept among the PHC health workers, while continuous public enlightenment and awareness campaign on spontaneous reporting of ADRs is advocated in order to enhance reporting rate.

AB Background: Empowerment of hospital workers is known as a key factor of organizational performance and occupational health. Nevertheless, empowering workers remains a real challenge. As in many traditional organizations, hospitals follow a bureaucratic model defined by a managerial culture of control and a stratified organization, which at once weaken professionals' mastery of their work and hinder their commitment and performance. Based on the existing literature this protocol describes a new managerial and organizational transformation program as well as the study design of its effect on worker empowerment in a large French public hospital. The project is funded by the French Ministry of Health for a total of 498,180 (sic).
   Methods: This study is a randomized controlled trial conducted in a French university hospital complex (CHU). The CHU comprises 12 sub-centers (SC) with about 20 care units and 1000 employees each. Randomization is performed at SC level. The intervention lasts 12 months and combines accompaniment of healthcare teams, frontline managers and SC directors to empower first-line professionals in the experimental SC. Quantitative outcome measurements are collected over 2 years during mandatory check-ups in the occupational medicine department. The primary outcomes are structural and psychological empowerment, motivational processes, managerial practices, working conditions, health and performance. Mixed linear modeling is the primary data analysis strategy.
   Discussion: The protocol was approved by the CHU health ethics committee. The results of the analysis of the intervention effects will be reported in a series of scientific articles. The results will contribute to reflection on prevention and management policies, and to the development of Workplace Quality-of-Life. If the intervention is a success, the system will warrant replication in other SCs and in other health facilities.

AB Background: Patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) who use emergency medical services (EMS) receive quicker reperfusion treatment which, in turn, mitigates post-stroke disability. However, nationally only 59% use EMS. We examined why AIS patients use or do not use EMS.
   Methods: During 2016-2018, a convenience sample of AIS patients admitted to a primary stroke center in South Carolina were surveyed during hospitalization if they were medically fit, available for survey when contacted, and consented to participate. The survey was programed into EpiInfo with skip patterns to minimize survey burden and self-administered on a touchscreen computer. Survey questions covered symptom characteristics, knowledge of stroke and EMS importance, subjective reactions, role of bystanders and financial factors. Descriptive and multiple regression analyses were performed.
   Results: Of 108 inpatients surveyed (out of 1179 AIS admissions), 49% were male, 44% African American, mean age 63.5 years, 59% mild strokes, 75 (69%) arrived by EMS, 33% were unaware of any stroke symptom prior to stroke, and 75% were unaware of the importance of EMS use for good outcome. Significant factors that influenced EMS use decisions (identified by regression analysis adjusting for stroke severity) were: prior familiarity with stroke (self or family/friend with stroke) adjusted odds ratio, 5.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.6, 15.1), perceiving symptoms as relevant for self and indicating possible stroke, 26.3 (7.6, 91.1), and bystander discouragement to call 911, 0.1 (0.01, 0.7). Further, all 27 patients who knew the importance of EMS had used EMS. All patients whose physician office advised actions other than calling EMS at symptom onset, did not use EMS.
   Conclusion: Systematic stroke education of patients with stroke-relevant comorbidities and life-style risk factors, and public health educational programs may increase EMS use and mitigate post-stroke disability.

AB Background: Obesity and metabolic diseases represent a major health burden in the Caribbean, particularly since a large part of the population is disadvantaged. However, socioeconomic inequalities in chronic diseases are poorly explored in this region. We investigated the association between socioeconomic position and metabolic syndrome (MetS) prevalence and explored the contribution of diet quality to explain this association, among adults in the French West Indies.
   Methods: This cross-sectional analysis included 1144 subjects (=16 y) from a multistage sampling survey conducted in 2013-2014 on a representative sample of the Guadeloupean and Martinican population. MetS prevalence was assessed using the Joint Interim Statement. Dietary intakes were estimated from 24 h-dietary recalls, and diet quality was assessed through the Diet Quality Index-International (DQI-I). Associations between socioeconomic indicators (education, employment, social assistance benefits) and MetS prevalence, and the potential contribution of diet quality in this association were assessed using multivariable logistic regression models, adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics.
   Results: MetS prevalence adjusted for age and sex was 21 and 30% among Guadeloupean and Martinican, respectively. Compared to high-educated participants, low-educated subjects were more likely to be at risk of MetS (OR = 2.4; 95%CI = [1.3-4.4], respectively), as were recipients of social assistance benefits compared to non-recipients (OR = 2.0; 95%CI = [1.0-4.0]). The DQI-I explained 10.5% of the overall variation in MetS due to education.
   Conclusions: Socioeconomic inequalities in MetS prevalence, reflected by education and social assistance benefits, were found. However, diet quality contributed only to socioeconomic inequalities due to education underlining that education may impact health through the ability to generate overall dietary behavior, long-term beneficial. Our work identified subgroups with higher risk of MetS, which is needed when implementing public health measures, particularly in this Caribbean population with of high poverty rates. Further prospective studies are needed to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of social inequalities in MetS in a high poverty rates context.

AB Background: Integrative medicine (IM) is a patient-centered, evidence-based, therapeutic paradigm which combines conventional and complementary approaches. The use of IM in pediatrics has increased in the past two decades and parents' demand for it is growing. An IM whole systems approach is anthroposophic medicine. Considering the growing demand for integrative approaches in children, it is relevant from a public health perspective to find out which kind of children use IM in Germany and whether they differ from the entirety of pediatric inpatients in Germany. Moreover, it would be interesting to known, whether these patients are willing to travel a longer distance to gain integrative treatment.
   Methods: The present study investigates the standard ward documentation datasets of 29,956 patients of all German integrative anthroposophic pediatric inpatient wards from 2005 to 2016 and compares them systematically to collect data of the entirety of all pediatric inpatient wards in Germany. Apart from patients' age and gender, and the ICD-10 admission diagnoses, the geographical catchment area of the hospitals were analyzed.
   Results: Sociodemographic characteristics of pediatric inpatients in the integrative anthroposophic departments (IAH) did not differ from the entirety of all pediatric inpatients. Regarding clinical characteristics, higher frequencies were found for endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases (IAH: 7.24% vs. 2.98%); mental, behavioral, and neurodevelopmental disorders (IAH: 9.83% vs. 3.78%) and nervous diseases (IAH: 8.82% vs. 5.16%) and lower frequencies for general pediatric diseases such as respiratory diseases (IAH: 17.06% vs. 19.83%), digestive diseases (IAH: 3.90% vs. 6.25%), and infectious and parasitic diseases (IAH: 12.88% vs. 14.82%) in comparison to the entirety of all pediatric inpatients in Germany. The IAH showed a broad catchment area, with most patients being from former, Western federal republic of Germany. Large catchment areas (> 100 km) for the IAH are merely covered by severe and chronic diseases.
   Conclusion: Pediatric inpatients of IAH do not differ from the entirety of pediatric inpatients in Germany regarding sociodemographic characteristics but show differences regarding clinical characteristics. Parents are willing to travel further distance to get specialized integrative anthroposophic medical care for children with severe and chronic diseases.

TI Factors that influence implementation at scale of a community-based

ID PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; PROGRAM; DISSEMINATION; LIFE; TRANSLATION;
   PREVENTION; PREVALENCE; DISABILITY; FRAMEWORK; OUTCOMES
AB Background: Despite the many known benefits of physical activity (PA), relatively few older adults are active on a regular basis. Older adult PA interventions delivered in controlled settings showed promising results. However, to achieve population level health impact, programs must be effectively scaled-up, and few interventions have achieved this. To effectively scale-up it is essential to identify contextual factors that facilitate or impede implementation at scale. Our aim is to describe factors that influence implementation at scale of a health promotion intervention for older adults (Choose to Move). This implementation evaluation complements our previously published study that assessed the impact of Choose to Move on older adult health indicators.
   Methods: To describe factors that influenced implementation our evaluation targeted five distinct levels across a socioecological continuum. Four members of our project team conducted semi-structured interviews by telephone with 1) leaders of delivery partner organizations (n = 13) 2) recreation managers (n = 6), recreation coordinators (n = 27), activity coaches (n = 36) and participants (n = 42) [August 2015 - April 2017]. Interviews were audio-recorded and professionally transcribed and data were analyzed using framework analysis.
   Results: Partners agreed on the timeliness and need for scaled-up evidence-based health promotion programs for older adults. Choose to Move aligned with organizational priorities, visions and strategic directions and was deemed easy to deliver, flexible and adaptable. Partners also noted the critical role played by our project team as the support unit. However, partners noted availability of financial resources as a potential barrier to sustainability.
   Conclusions: Even relatively simple evidence-based interventions can be challenging to scale-up and sustain. To ensure successful implementation it is essential to align with multilevel socioecological perspectives and assess the vast array of contextual factors that are at the core of better understanding successful implementation.

   outbreak; Travel-associated; Public health

AB Background: In Norway, Legionnaires' disease is reportable upon clinical suspicion to public health authorities and mandatorily notifiable through the Norwegian surveillance system for communicable diseases (MSIS) for both clinicians and laboratories. In the summer of 2017, several European countries reported high notification rates for Legionnaires' disease, which was not observed in Norway. We evaluated MSIS to assess if it meets its objectives of detecting cases and trends in incidence of Legionnaires' disease.
   Methods: We retrieved MSIS data from 2008 to 2017 and calculated timeliness as days from sampling to notification, and internal completeness for key variables as the proportion of observations with a value. Where possible, we assessed internal validity on the presence of a plausible value. To estimate external completeness and validity we linked MSIS with hospital reimbursement claims in the Norwegian Patient Registry. To assess acceptability and representativeness, we surveyed doctors in 39 hospitals on their units' diagnostic and notification procedures, and their use of MSIS.
   Results: There were 438 notified cases. Internal completeness and internal validity were high for key variables (>= 95%).
   The median delay from sampling to notification was 4 days.
   There were 73 patients in MSIS only, 70 in the Norwegian Patient Registry only, and 351 in both registers. The external completeness of MSIS was 83% (95% CI 80-86%). For external validity, the positive predictive value of MSIS was 83% (95% CI 79-86%).
   Forty-seven respondents from 28 hospitals described testing procedures. These were inconsistent: 29 (62%) reported no systematic application of criteria for requesting legionella testing. Eighteen (38%) reported testing all patients with suspected pneumonia and a travel history. Thirty-one (66%) found the notification criteria clear.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that the surveillance in MSIS can detect incidence changes for Legionnaires' disease over time, by place and person, but likely does not detect every case diagnosed in Norway.
   We recommend wider investigation of diagnostic procedures in order to improve representativeness and awareness of MSIS notification criteria among clinicians in order to improve acceptability of the surveillance. We also recommend a more comprehensive assessment of whether patients only registered in the Norwegian Patient Registry were true Legionnaires' disease cases.

AB The objectives of this study were to examine differences in physical activity behaviors as a function of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status and sex, to test differences in physical activity self-efficacy (PASE), body weight satisfaction (BWS), and enjoyment of physical activity as a function of HIV status, and to determine if PASE, BWS, and enjoyment are associated with daily physical activity (daily PA), muscle strengthening activities, and sedentary behavior of youth with and without HIV. A total of 250 HIV positive (HIV+) and HIV negative (HIV-) youth from Botswana aged 12-23 years (Mean = 17.87, SD = 2.24) participated in the study. The HIV+ group (n = 88) was recruited from a previous 12-month antiretroviral therapy (ART) and nutrition intervention study. The HIV-group (n = 162) was randomly selected from public junior and senior (secondary) high schools in and around Gaborone. Participants' PASE, BWS, enjoyment of physical activity, daily PA, muscle strengthening, body mass index (BMI), and sedentary behavior were obtained using items from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) showed that the HIV-group (M = 1.20, SE = 0.06, CI = 1.08 to 1.32) had significantly higher daily PA than the HIV+ group (M = 0.99, SE = 0.08, CI = 0.82 to 1.15). The HIV-group (M = 0.91, SE = 0.06, CI = 0.79 to 1.03) also reported participating significantly more in muscle strengthening activities than the HIV+ group (M = 0.63, SD = 0.08, CI = 0.47 to 0.78). Multiple regression analyses showed that higher PASE (p <.001) and greater enjoyment of PA (p <.01) were predictive of higher daily PA. HIV-participants had higher PASE but lower BWS compared to HIV+ participants. Sex and age differences were observed in muscle strengthening activities and sedentary behavior. This study supports previous findings on the association of efficacy beliefs to daily PA and muscle strengthening activities. The findings have implications for PA interventions aimed at health promotion and mitigation of the effects of living with HIV/AIDS.

TI Trust, and distrust, of Ebola Treatment Centers: A case-study from
   Sierra Leone
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper considers local responses to the introduction of an Ebola Treatment Centre in eastern Sierra Leone during the West African epidemic of 2014-15. Our study used qualitative methods consisting of focus groups and interviews, to gather responses from patients, members of the families of survivors and deceased victims of the disease, social liaison workers from the centre, and members of the general public. The data indicate that scepticism and resistance were widespread at the outset, but that misconceptions were replaced, in the minds of those directly affected by the disease, by more positive later assessments. Social workers, and social contacts of families with workers in the centre, helped reshape these perceptions, but a major factor was direct experience of the disease. This is apparent in the positive endorsements by survivors and families who had members taken to the facility. Even relatives of deceased victims agreed that the case-handling centre was valuable. However, we also present evidence of continuing scepticism in the minds of members of the general public, who continue to suspect that Ebola was a crisis manufactured for external benefit. Our conclusions stress the importance of better connectivity between communities and Ebola facilities to facilitate experiential learning. There is also a need to address the wider cognitive shock caused by a well-funded Ebola health initiative arriving in communities with a long history of inadequate health care. Restoring trust in medicine requires Ebola Virus Disease to be re-contextualized within a broader framework of concern for the health of all citizens.

AB Introduction
   Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The advent of immunobiologic therapy with TNF inhibitors agents, has been associated with a significant increase in incident cases of tuberculosis in this population.
   Objective
   To estimate the incidence of tuberculosis in patients receiving TNF inhibitors therapy for rheumatic diseases. As secondary objectives, we sought to evaluate mortality and the clinical impact of screening for latent tuberculosis infection.
   Methods
   This retrospective study included patients with rheumatic diseases of Public Health System from the Brazilian state, a high TB incidence area, who received prescriptions of TNF inhibitors agents between 2006 and 2016.
   Results
   A total of 5853 rheumatic disease patients were included. Patients were predominantly women (68.7%) aged 49.5 (+/- 14.7) years old. Forty-three cases of TB were found (2.86 cases per 1000 person-years; 18 times higher than in the general population). Adalimumab and certolizumab users presented a higher risk for TB development compared to etanercept users (RR: 3.11, 95%CI 1.16-8.35; 7.47, 95%CI 1.39-40.0, respectively). In a subgroup of patients, screening for latent tuberculosis infection was performed in 86% of patients, and 30.2% had a positive tuberculin skin test. Despite latent TB treatment, TB was diagnosed in 2 out of 74 (2.7%) patients. Overall, TB diagnosis did not increase mortality.
   Conclusion
   In this population-based study of rheumatic disease patients from a high incident area, TNF inhibitor exposure was associated with an 18-time increased TB incidence. Adalimumab and certolizumab were associated with greater and earlier TB diagnosis compared to etanercept.

AB Backgrounds The efforts to develop research and training on physical rehabilitation in regards to disasters is considered recent worldwide. In the late evening of the 11th up until the 12th of January of 2011, the most massive natural disaster occurred in Brazil with extremely heavy downpour, abrupt flood, as well as landslides on multiple areas of the Mountain Region of Rio de Janeiro. The objective of this research was to investigate the challenges in terms of physical rehabilitation provided by this event Methods The cross-sectional mixed method's study, which was conducted in the city of Nova Friburgo, used two different data sources: hospital records on traumatic injuries pre and post disaster, and interviews with key informants - victims who suffered injuries related to the disaster, professionals from rehabilitation services in the municipality, and also the city's health service management. Pearson's chi-squared test was performed to evaluate statistical significance between the week of a given incident and the type of injury. Interviews were transcribed and analysed through content analysis. Results A total of 2326 hospital records and 27 interviews were analysed. The proportion of traumatic injury in the municipal emergency service increased from 16% in the prior week, to 40% in the week post-disaster (p < 0.0001). Different injuries were identified: multiple fractures, crushing, amputation, perforation of soft tissues, inhalation of dust and establishment of chronic conditions through stress. Despite this scenario, out of the 16 health professionals interviewed, twelve did not observe an increase in the demand for outpatient rehabilitation services after the disaster. Interviews with the victims revealed that the pathways for care ran into different barriers. From 11 victims interviewed, only one received complete physiotherapy care through the public health services in the city, while all others hired additional assistance, received volunteer services, had assistance in other cities or remained without rehabilitation. Conclusions The needs for rehabilitation increased after the disaster; however, the demand was repressed due to different barriers such as competing needs and possible lack of medical referral. Recommendations were made, including the action of performing a search of victims with rehabilitation needs.

AB Background Suicide is one of the leading causes of death and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) worldwide. The economic, emotional and human cost of suicidal behaviour to individuals, families, communities and society makes it a serious public health issue. We aim to determine the prevalence and factors associated with self-reported suicidal behaviour (suicidal ideation and attempt) among school going adolescents (13-17 years). Methods This is a secondary analysis of a nationally representative data for Bhutan namely Global School Based Student Health Survey in 2016 which reports on various dimensions of adolescent health including suicidal behaviour. The survey employed a multistage sampling method to recruit participants aged 13-17 years (n = 5809) from 50 schools (25 each in rural and urban area). The survey used an anonymous self-administered pre-tested 84-item questionnaire. Weighted analysis was done. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) and adjusted Odds Ratios (aORs) have been presented with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results A total of 667 (11.6%) adolescents reported considering a suicide attempt whereas 656 (11.3%) reported attempting suicide in the past 12 months. Among those reporting suicidal ideation, 388 (58.6%) reported attempting a suicide and 274 (41.4%) had ideation alone, whereas, 247 (38.9%) reported attempting a suicide without previous ideation. Female sex, food insecurity, physical attack, sexual violence, bullying, feeling of loneliness, low parental engagement, reported worry about lack of sleep, urge to use drugs/alcohol, smokeless tobacco use, drug abuse and parental smoking were the factors associated with suicidal attempt. All these factors except smokeless tobacco use and parental smoking were associated with suicidal ideation. Having helpful/close friends was found to be protective against suicide ideation. Conclusion Suicidal behaviour among school going adolescents in Bhutan is high and alarming, especially among girls. Bullying, sexual violence, feeling of loneliness and drug abuse were some of the key risk factors identified. It is important to identify these risk factors early and effectively tackle them in order to prevent suicides. It requires a multi-faceted intervention with the support of the children, community, teachers and parents.

AB Background Cure rates for children with cancer in India lag behind that of high-income countries. Various disease, treatment and socio-economic related factors contribute to this gap including barriers in timely access of diagnostic and therapeutic care. This study investigated barriers to accessing care from symptom onset to beginning of treatment, from perspectives of caregivers of children with cancer in India. Methods Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with caregivers of children (< 18 years) diagnosed with cancer in seven tertiary care hospitals across New Delhi and Hyderabad. Purposive sampling to saturation was used to ensure adequate representation of the child's gender, age, cancer type, geographical location and socioeconomic status. Interviews were audio recorded after obtaining informed consent. Thematic content analysis was conducted and organised using NVivo 11. Results Thirty-nine caregivers were interviewed, where three key themes emerged from the narratives: time intervals to definitive diagnosis and treatment, the importance of social supportive care and the overall accumulative impacts of the journey. There were two phases encapsulating the experiences of the family: referral pathways taken to reach the hospital and after reaching the hospital. Most caregivers, especially those from distant geographical areas had variable and inconsistent referral pathways partly due to poor availability of specialist doctors and diagnostic facilities outside major cities, influence from family or friends, and long travel times. Upon reaching the hospital, families mostly from public hospitals faced challenges navigating the hospital facilities, finding accommodation, and comprehending the diagnosis and treatment pathway. Throughout both phases, financial constraint was a recurring issue amongst low-income families. The caregiver's knowledge and awareness of the disease and health system, religious and social factors were also common barriers. Conclusion This qualitative study highlights and explores some of the barriers to childhood cancer care in India. Our findings show that referral pathways are intrinsically linked to the treatment experience and there should be better recognition of the financial and emotional challenges faced by the family that occur prior to definitive diagnosis and treatment. This information would help inform various stakeholders and contribute to improved interventions addressing these barriers.

AB Background The main objective is to better understand the prevalence of depressive symptoms, in long-term care (LTC) residents with or without cognitive impairment across Western Canada. Secondary objectives are to examine comorbidities and other factors associated with of depressive symptoms, and treatments used in LTC. Methods 11,445 residents across a random sample of 91 LTC facilities, from 09/2014 to 05/2015, were stratified by owner-operator model (private for-profit, public or voluntary not-for-profit), size (small: < 80 beds, medium: 80-120 beds, large > 120 beds), location (Calgary and Edmonton Health Zones, Alberta; Fraser and Interior Health Regions, British Columbia; Winnipeg Health Region, Manitoba). Random intercept generalized linear mixed models with depressive symptoms as the dependent variable, cognitive impairment as primary independent variable, and resident, care unit and facility characteristics as covariates were used. Resident variables came from the Resident Assessment Instrument - Minimum Data Set (RAI-MDS) 2.0 records (the RAI-MDS version routinely collected in Western Canadian LTC). Care unit and facility variables came from surveys completed with care unit or facility managers. Results Depressive symptoms affects 27.1% of all LTC residents and 23.3% of LTC resident have both, depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment. Hypertension, urinary and fecal incontinence were the most common comorbidities. Cognitive impairment increases the risk for depressive symptoms (adjusted odds ratio 1.65 [95% confidence interval 1.43; 1.90]). Pain, anxiety and pulmonary disorders were also significantly associated with depressive symptoms. Pharmacologic therapies were commonly used in those with depressive symptoms, however there was minimal use of non-pharmacologic management. Conclusions Depressive symptoms are common in LTC residents -particularly in those with cognitive impairment. Depressive symptoms are an important target for clinical intervention and further research to reduce the burden of these illnesses.

AB Background Chronic hepatitis C is a major public health burden. With new interferon-free direct-acting agents (showing sustained viral response rates of more than 98%), elimination of HCV seems feasible for the first time. However, as HCV infection often remains undiagnosed, screening is crucial for improving health outcomes of HCV-patients. Our aim was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of a nationwide screening strategy in Germany. Methods We used a Markov cohort model to simulate disease progression and examine long-term population outcomes, HCV associated costs and cost-effectiveness of HCV screening. The model divides the total population into three subpopulations: general population (GEP), people who inject drugs (PWID) and HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM), with total infection numbers being highest in GEP, but new infections occurring only in PWIDs and MSM. The model compares four alternative screening strategies (no/basic/advanced/total screening) differing in participation and treatment rates. Results Total number of HCV-infected patients declined from 275,000 in 2015 to between 125,000 (no screening) and 14,000 (total screening) in 2040. Similarly, lost quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were 320,000 QALYs lower, while costs were 2.4 billion EUR higher in total screening compared to no screening. While incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) increased sharply in GEP and MSM with more comprehensive strategies (30,000 EUR per QALY for total vs. advanced screening), ICER decreased in PWIDs (30 EUR per QALY for total vs. advanced screening). Conclusions Screening is key to have an efficient decline of the HCV-infected population in Germany. Recommendation for an overall population screening is to screen the total PWID subpopulation, and to apply less comprehensive advanced screening for MSM and GEP.

AB Background Identifying dementia early in time, using real world data, is a public health challenge. As only two-thirds of people with dementia now ultimately receive a formal diagnosis in United Kingdom health systems and many receive it late in the disease process, there is ample room for improvement. The policy of the UK government and National Health Service (NHS) is to increase rates of timely dementia diagnosis. We used data from general practice (GP) patient records to create a machine-learning model to identify patients who have or who are developing dementia, but are currently undetected as having the condition by the GP. Methods We used electronic patient records from Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Using a case-control design, we selected patients aged >65y with a diagnosis of dementia (cases) and matched them 1:1 by sex and age to patients with no evidence of dementia (controls). We developed a list of 70 clinical entities related to the onset of dementia and recorded in the 5 years before diagnosis. After creating binary features, we trialled machine learning classifiers to discriminate between cases and controls (logistic regression, naive Bayes, support vector machines, random forest and neural networks). We examined the most important features contributing to discrimination. Results The final analysis included data on 93,120 patients, with a median age of 82.6 years; 64.8% were female. The naive Bayes model performed least well. The logistic regression, support vector machine, neural network and random forest performed very similarly with an AUROC of 0.74. The top features retained in the logistic regression model were disorientation and wandering, behaviour change, schizophrenia, self-neglect, and difficulty managing. Conclusions Our model could aid GPs or health service planners with the early detection of dementia. Future work could improve the model by exploring the longitudinal nature of patient data and modelling decline in function over time.

TI Estimating snakebite incidence from mathematical models: A test in Costa

AB Background
   Snakebite envenoming is a neglected public health challenge that affects mostly economically deprived communities who inhabit tropical regions. In these regions, snakebite incidence data is not always reliable, and access to health care is scare and heterogeneous. Thus, addressing the problem of snakebite effectively requires an understanding of how spatial heterogeneity in snakebite is associated with human demographics and snakes' distribution. Here, we use a mathematical model to address the determinants of spatial heterogeneity in snakebite and we estimate snakebite incidence in a tropical country such as Costa Rica.
   Methods and findings
   We combined a mathematical model that follows the law of mass action, where the incidence is proportional to the exposed human population and the venomous snake population, with a spatiotemporal dataset of snakebite incidence (Data from year 1990 to 2007 for 193 districts) in Costa Rica. This country harbors one of the most dangerous venomous snakes, which is the Terciopelo (Bothrops asper, Garman, 1884). We estimated B. asper distribution using a maximum entropy algorithm, and its abundance was estimated based on field data. Then, the model was adjusted to the data using a lineal regression with the reported incidence. We found a significant positive correlation (R-2 = 0.66, p-value < 0.01) between our estimation and the reported incidence, suggesting the model has a good performance in estimating snakebite incidence.
   Conclusions
   Our model underscores the importance of the synergistic effect of exposed population size and snake abundance on snakebite incidence. By combining information from venomous snakes' natural history with census data from rural populations, we were able to estimate snakebite incidence in Costa Rica. The model was able to fit the incidence data at fine administrative scale (district level), which is fundamental for the implementation and planning of management strategies oriented to reduce snakebite burden.

TI Intralesional infiltration versus parenteral use of meglumine

   cost-effectiveness analysis
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID THRESHOLDS; INTERVENTIONS
AB Cutaneous leishmaniasis (LC) is a complex and variable disease in terms of epidemiology, aetiology, pathology and clinical characteristics. The mainstay of treatment is still pentavalent antimony (Sbv) compounds administered systemically, despite their recognized toxicity. The advantages of antimony intralesional (IL) infiltration are the use of lower doses of Sbv and, therefore, less toxic effects. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness ratio of intralesional meglumine antimoniate therapy (IL-MA) compared with endovenous meglumine antimoniate therapy (EV-MA) for the treatment of CL in the context of the Brazilian National Health System (SUS). An analytical decision model (decision tree) was developed using TreeAge Pro 2018 software. Data from the open-label, uncontrolled phase II clinical trial evaluating IL-MA were used as a reference for posology, efficacy, and adverse event rates (AE). The same premises for the intravenous approach (EV-MA) were extracted from systematic literature reviews. Macro and micro calculations of spending were included in the analysis. The IL-MA and EV-MA strategies had a total cost per patient cured of US$330.81 and US$494.16, respectively. The intralesional approach was dominant, meaning it was more economic and effective than was endovenous therapy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio showed that IL-MA could result in savings of US $864.37 for each additional patient cured, confirming that the IL-MA strategy is cost effective in the context of the Brazilian public health scenario.

AB Echinococcosis represents a major public health problem worldwide and is considered a neglected disease by the World Health Organization. The etiological agents are Echinococcus tapeworms, which display elaborate developmental traits that imply a complex control of gene expression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small regulatory RNAs, are involved in the regulation of many biological processes such as development and metabolism. They act through the repression of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) usually by binding to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). Previously, we described the miRNome of several Echinococcus species and found that miRNAs are highly expressed in all life cycle stages, suggesting an important role in gene expression regulation. However, studying the role of miRNAs in helminth biology remains a challenge. To develop methodology for functional analysis of miRNAs in tapeworms, we performed miRNA knockdown experiments in primary cell cultures of Echinococcus multilocularis, which mimic the development of metacestode vesicles from parasite stem cells in vitro. First, we analysed the miRNA repertoire of E. multilocularis primary cells by small RNA-seq and found that miR-71, a bilaterian miRNA absent in vertebrate hosts, is one of the top five most expressed miRNAs. Using genomic information and bioinformatic algorithms for miRNA binding prediction, we found a high number of potential miR-71 targets in E. multilocularis. Inhibition of miRNAs can be achieved by transfection of antisense oligonucleotides (anti-miRs) that block miRNA function. To this end, we evaluated a variety of chemically modified anti-miRs for miR-71 knockdown. Electroporation of primary cells with 2'-O-methyl modified anti-miR-71 led to significantly reduced miR-71 levels. Transcriptomic analyses showed that several predicted miR-71 targets were up-regulated in anti-miR-treated primary cells, including genes potentially involved in parasite development, host parasite interaction, and several genes of as yet unknown function. Notably, miR-71silenced primary cell cultures showed a strikingly different phenotype from control cells and did not develop into fully mature metacestodes. These findings indicate an important function of miR-71 in Echinococcus development and provide, for the first time, methodology to functionally study miRNAs in a tapeworm.

AB Rabies is a zoonotic disease caused by infection with rabies virus, which circulates naturally in several wild carnivore and bat reservoirs in the United States (US). The most important reservoir in the US from an animal and public health perspective is the raccoon (Procyon lotor). To prevent the westward expansion of a significant raccoon rabies epizootic along the eastern seaboard, an operational control program implementing oral rabies vaccination (ORV) has existed in the US since the 1990s. Recently, two vaccine efficacy studies conducted with raccoons and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) provided the opportunity to determine if volatile fecal metabolites might be used to non-invasively monitor ORV programs and/or predict virus protection for these species. The volatile metabolome is a rich source of information that may significantly contribute to our understanding of disease and infection. Fecal samples were collected at multiple time points from raccoons and striped skunks subjected to oral treatment with rabies vaccine (or sham). Intramuscular challenge with a lethal dose of rabies virus was used to determine protection status at six (raccoons) and 11 (skunks) months post-vaccination. In addition to fecal samples, blood was collected at various time points to permit quantitative assessment of rabies antibody responses arising from immunization. Feces were analyzed by headspace gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection and the chromatographic responses were grouped according to cluster analysis. Cluster scores were subjected to multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) to determine if fecal volatiles may hold a signal of immunization status. Multiple regression was then used to build models of the measured immune responses based on the metabolomic data. MANOVA results identified one cluster associated with protective status of skunks and one cluster associated with protective status of raccoons. Regression models demonstrated considerably greater success in predicting rabies antibody responses in both species. This is the first study to link volatile compounds with measures of adaptive immunity and provides further evidence that the volatile metabolome holds great promise for contributing to our understanding of disease and infections. The volatile metabolome may be an important resource for monitoring rabies immunization in raccoons and striped skunks.

AB Background
   The yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti is the major vector of dengue, yellow fever, Zika, and Chikungunya viruses. Worldwide vector control is largely based on insecticide treatments but, unfortunately, vector control programs are facing operational challenges due to mosquitoes becoming resistant to commonly used insecticides. In Southeast Asia, resistance of Ae. aegypti to chemical insecticides has been documented in several countries but no data regarding insecticide resistance has been reported in Laos. To fill this gap, we assessed the insecticide resistance of 11 Ae. aegypti populations to larvicides and adulticides used in public health operations in the country. We also investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms associated with resistance, including target site mutations and detoxification enzymes putatively involved in metabolic resistance.
   Methods and results Bioassays on adults and larvae collected in five provinces revealed various levels of resistance to organophosphates (malathion and temephos), organochlorine (DDT) and pyrethroids (permethrin and deltamethrin). Synergist bioassays showed a significant increased susceptibility of mosquitoes to insecticides after exposure to detoxification enzyme inhibitors. Biochemical assays confirmed these results by showing significant elevated activities of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450), glutathione S-transferases (GST) and carboxylesterases (CCE) in adults. Two kdr mutations, V1016G and F1534C, were detected by qPCR at low and high frequency, respectively, in all populations tested. A significant negative association between the two kdr mutations was detected. No significant association between kdr mutations frequency (for both 1534C and 1016G) and survival rate to DDT or permethrin (P > 0.05) was detected. Gene Copy Number Variations (CNV) were detected for particular detoxification enzymes. At the population level, the presence of CNV affecting the carboxylesterase CCEAE3A and the two cytochrome P450 CYP6BB2 and CYP6P12 were significantly correlated to insecticide resistance.
   Conclusions
   These results suggest that both kdr mutations and metabolic resistance mechanisms are present in Laos but their impact on phenotypic resistance may differ in proportion at the population or individual level. Molecular analyses suggest that CNV affecting CCEAE3A previously associated with temephos resistance is also associated with malathion resistance while CNV affecting CYP6BB2 and CYP6P12 are associated with pyrethroid and possibly DDT resistance. The presence of high levels of insecticide resistance in the main arbovirus vector in Laos is worrying and may have important implications for dengue vector control in the country.

AB Background
   Leptospirosis is a widespread zoonotic disease that causes reproductive losses and/or hepatorenal failure in a number of animal species. Wild reservoirs of the disease, such as rodents, harbor the causative bacterium, Leptospira spp., in their kidneys and contaminate the environment by excreting infected urine. In this study, we tested small wild mammals, environmental water, and livestock in the Cumberland Gap region of southeastern Appalachia for the presence of pathogenic Leptospira or leptospiral antibodies.
   Methods/Results
   Small wild mammals (n = 101) and environmental water samples (n = 89) were screened by a real time quantitative PCR that targets the pathogenic Leptospira-specific lipl32 gene. Kidneys from 63 small wild mammals (62.37%) and two water sources (2.25%) tested positive for leptospiral DNA. To identify the infecting leptospiral species in qPCR-positive water and kidney samples, a fragment of leptospiral rpoB gene was PCR amplified and sequenced. L. kirschneri and L. interrogans were the leptospiral species carried by small wild mammals. Furthermore, sera from livestock (n = 52; cattle and horses) were screened for leptospiral antibodies using microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Twenty sera (38.46%) from livestock had antibodies to one or more serovars of pathogenic Leptospira spp.
   Conclusions
   In conclusion, results from our study show exposure to leptospiral infection in farm animals and the presence of this zoonotic pathogen in the environmental water and kidneys of a significant number of small wild mammals. The public health implications of these findings remain to be assessed.

TI Spatio-temporal patterns of scrub typhus in mainland China, 2006-2017
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID RICKETTSIAL DISEASES; ASSOCIATION; INFECTION; DIAGNOSIS; DISTRICT
AB Background
   Scrub typhus, a serious public health problem in the Asia-Pacific area, is endemic in the "tsutsugamushi triangle" area. Scrub typhus has been widespread and has become a significant health concern in China. However, spatiotemporal patterns need to be investigated further.
   Objective
   This study aims to explore spatiotemporal patterns, diffusion characteristics and regional distribution differences of scrub typhus cases in mainland China from January 2006 to December 2017.
   Method
   Monthly cases of scrub typhus reported at the county level during 2006-2017 were obtained. Time-series analyses, spatial distribution analyses, spatial diffusion analyses, spatial autocorrelation analyses and space-time scan statistic analyses were used to explore spatiotemporal characteristics of scrub typhus.
   Results
   A total of 121 251 scrub typhus cases were reported in 30 provinces (or municipalities) of mainland China during 2006-2017, which rose exponentially. There were seasonal characteristics from June to November for scrub typhus. Scrub typhus had been diffused from south, southwest, southeast and eastern coasts to center, north, northeast and northwest in mainland China. Scrub typhus occurrences were from point to surrounding regions, and from south to north every year. The peak periods of scrub typhus became longer and longer from north to southwest to south in mainland China. There existed a single peak in Southwest region and North region, respectively, but existed a bimodal peak for South region. Scrub typhus cases were clustered in Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian and Anhui among June to November. The scrub typhus epidemics in Guangdong and Yunnan were the most serious.
   Conclusions
   The results in this study can be guide targeted public health interventions against scrub typhus at the county level.

AB Background
   The French dietary guidelines were updated in 2017, and an adherence score to the new guidelines (Programme National Nutrition Sante Guidelines Score 2 [PNNS-GS2]) has been developed and validated recently. Since overweight and obesity are key public health issues and have been related to major chronic conditions, this prospective study aimed to measure the association between PNNS-GS2 and risk of overweight and obesity, and to compare these results with those for the modified Programme National Nutrition Sante Guidelines Score (mPNNS-GS1), reflecting adherence to 2001 guidelines.
   Methods and findings
   Participants (N = 54,089) were recruited among French adults (>= 18 years old, mean baseline age = 47.1 [SD 14.1] years, 78.3% women) in the NutriNet-Sante web-based cohort. Mean (SD) score was 1.7 (3.3) for PNNS-GS2 and 8.2 (1.6) for mPNNS-GS1. Selected participants were those included between 2009 and 2014 and followed up to September 2018 (median follow-up = 6 years). Collected data included at least three 24-hour dietary records over a 2-year period following inclusion, baseline sociodemographics, and anthropometric data over time. In Cox regression models, PNNS-GS2 was strongly and linearly associated with a lower risk of overweight and obesity (HR for quintile 5 versus quintile 1 [95% CI] = 0.48 [0.43-0.54], p < 0.001, and 0.47 [0.40-0.55], p < 0.001, for overweight and obesity, respectively). These results were much weaker for mPNNS-GS1 (HR for quintile 5 versus quintile 1 = 0.90 [0.80-0.99], p = 0.03, and 0.98 [0.84-1.15], p = 0.8, for overweight and obesity, respectively). In multilevel models, PNNS-GS2 was negatively associated with baseline BMI and BMI increase over time (beta for a 1-SD increase in score [95% CI] = -0.040 [-0.041; -0.038], p < 0.001, and -0.00080 [-0.00094; -0.00066], p < 0.001, respectively). In "direct comparison" models, PNNS-GS2 was associated with a lower risk of overweight and obesity, lower baseline BMI, and lower BMI increase over time than mPNNS-GS1. Study limitations include possible selection bias, reliance on participant self-report, use of arbitrary cutoffs in data analyses, and residual confounding, but robustness was tested in sensitivity analyses.
   Conclusions Our findings suggest that adherence to the 2017 French dietary guidelines is associated with a lower risk of overweight and obesity. The magnitude of the association and the results of the direct comparison reinforced the validity of the updated recommendations.

AB Background Gun violence has shortened the average life expectancy of Americans, and better knowledge about the root causes of gun violence is crucial to its prevention. While some empirical evidence exists regarding the impacts of social and economic factors on violence and firearm homicide rates, to the author's knowledge, there has yet to be a comprehensive and comparative lagged, multilevel investigation of major social determinants of health in relation to firearm homicides and mass shootings. Methods and findings This study used negative binomial regression models and geolocated gun homicide incident data from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2015, to explore and compare the independent associations of key state-, county-, and neighborhood-level social determinants of health-social mobility, social capital, income inequality, racial and economic segregation, and social spending-with neighborhood firearm-related homicides and mass shootings in the United States, accounting for relevant state firearm laws and a variety of state, county, and neighborhood (census tract [CT]) characteristics. Latitude and longitude coordinates on firearm-related deaths were previously collected by the Gun Violence Archive, and then linked by the British newspaper The Guardian to CTs according to 2010 Census geographies. The study population consisted of all 74,134 CTs as defined for the 2010 Census in the 48 states of the contiguous US. The final sample spanned 70,579 CTs, containing an estimated 314,247,908 individuals, or 98% of the total US population in 2015. The analyses were based on 13,060 firearm-related deaths in 2015, with 11,244 non-mass shootings taking place in 8,673 CTs and 141 mass shootings occurring in 138 CTs. For area-level social determinants, lag periods of 3 to 17 years were examined based on existing theory, empirical evidence, and data availability. County-level institutional social capital (levels of trust in institutions), social mobility, income inequality, and public welfare spending exhibited robust relationships with CT-level gun homicide rates and the total numbers of combined non-mass and mass shooting homicide incidents and non-mass shooting homicide incidents alone. A 1-standard deviation (SD) increase in institutional social capital was linked to a 19% reduction in the homicide rate (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.81, 95% CI 0.73-0.91, p < 0.001) and a 17% decrease in the number of firearm homicide incidents (IRR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.73-0.95, p = 0.01). Upward social mobility was related to a 25% reduction in the gun homicide rate (IRR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.66-0.86, p < 0.001) and a 24% decrease in the number of homicide incidents (IRR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.67-0.87, p < 0.001). Meanwhile, 1-SD increases in the neighborhood percentages of residents in poverty and males living alone were associated with 26%-27% and 12% higher homicide rates, respectively. Study limitations include possible residual confounding by factors at the individual/household level, and lack of disaggregation of gun homicide data by gender and race/ethnicity. Conclusions This study finds that the rich-poor gap, level of citizens' trust in institutions, economic opportunity, and public welfare spending are all related to firearm homicide rates in the US. Further establishing the causal nature of these associations and modifying these social determinants may help to address the growing gun violence epidemic and reverse recent life expectancy declines among Americans.

AB Background Worldwide opioid-related overdose has become a major public health crisis. People with opioid use disorder (OUD) are overrepresented in the criminal justice system and at higher risk for opioid-related mortality. However, correctional facilities frequently adopt an abstinence-only approach, seldom offering the gold standard opioid agonist treatment (OAT) to incarcerated persons with OUD. In an attempt to inform adequate management of OUD among incarcerated persons, we conducted a systematic review of opioid-related interventions delivered before, during, and after incarceration. Methods and findings We systematically reviewed 8 electronic databases for original, peer-reviewed literature published between January 2008 and October 2019. Our review included studies conducted among adult participants with OUD who were incarcerated or recently released into the community (<= 90 days post-incarceration). The search identified 2,356 articles, 46 of which met the inclusion criteria based on assessments by 2 independent reviewers. Thirty studies were conducted in North America, 9 in Europe, and 7 in Asia/Oceania. The systematic review included 22 randomized control trials (RCTs), 3 non-randomized clinical trials, and 21 observational studies. Eight observational studies utilized administrative data and included large sample sizes (median of 10,419 [range 2273-131,472] participants), and 13 observational studies utilized primary data, with a median of 140 (range 27-960) participants. RCTs and non-randomized clinical trials included a median of 198 (range 15-1,557) and 44 (range 27-382) participants, respectively. Twelve studies included only men, 1 study included only women, and in the remaining 33 studies, the percentage of women was below 30%. The majority of study participants were middle-aged adults (36-55 years). Participants treated at a correctional facility with methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) or buprenorphine (BPN)/naloxone (NLX) had lower rates of illicit opioid use, had higher adherence to OUD treatment, were less likely to be re-incarcerated, and were more likely to be working 1 year post-incarceration. Participants who received MMT or BPN/NLX while incarcerated had fewer nonfatal overdoses and lower mortality. The main limitation of our systematic review is the high heterogeneity of studies (different designs, settings, populations, treatments, and outcomes), precluding a meta-analysis. Other study limitations include the insufficient data about incarcerated women with OUD, and the lack of information about incarcerated populations with OUD who are not included in published research. Conclusions In this carefully conducted systematic review, we found that correctional facilities should scale up OAT among incarcerated persons with OUD. The strategy is likely to decrease opioid-related overdose and mortality, reduce opioid use and other risky behaviors during and after incarceration, and improve retention in addiction treatment after prison release. Immediate OAT after prison release and additional preventive strategies such as the distribution of NLX kits to at-risk individuals upon release greatly decrease the occurrence of opioid-related overdose and mortality. In an effort to mitigate the impact of the opioid-related overdose crisis, it is crucial to scale up OAT and opioid-related overdose prevention strategies (e.g., NLX) within a continuum of treatment before, during, and after incarceration.
   Author summaryWhy was this study done? Opioid use disorder has been rising at an alarming rate, and opioid-related overdose is now a major public health crisis. Persons with opioid use disorder are overrepresented in the criminal justice system and face higher risks for opioid-related mortality. However, opioid use treatment is severely limited in correctional facilities. To address the opioid-related overdose crisis, it is pivotal to improve access to opioid use treatment inside correctional facilities and to assure proper linkage into addiction care post-incarceration. What did the researchers do and find? We conducted a systematic review of opioid-related interventions delivered before, during, and after incarceration. Our search identified 2,356 scientific articles, of which 46 studies were eligible for inclusion in our review. Participants treated at a correctional institution with the gold standard treatment for opioid use disorders, opioid agonist treatment, had higher adherence to addiction treatment, had lower rates of relapse into illicit opioid use, were less likely to be re-incarcerated, and were more likely to be working 1 year post-incarceration. Participants who received opioid agonist treatment while incarcerated and were adequately linked into care post-release experienced a significant decrease in nonfatal overdose rates and mortality. What do these findings mean? In an effort to mitigate the impact of the opioid-related overdose crisis, it is crucial to scale up opioid-related treatment and prevention strategies within a continuum of treatment before, during, and after incarceration.

AB Author summaryWhy was this study done? Vaccine hesitancy, often parental reluctance or refusal to vaccinate their children, is a growing challenge in public health; however, there is debate on the role of government-level vaccination policies to address this problem. Limited empirical research has evaluated the impact of governmental vaccination policies that restrict the ability of parents to obtain nonmedical exemptions from routine vaccination requirements. The 2016 California vaccine policy (Senate Bill 277) that eliminated nonmedical childhood vaccination exemptions provides an opportunity to empirically estimate the impact of a governmental state-level policy on vaccine coverage. What did the researchers do and find? We evaluated the 2016 California vaccine policy by applying a synthetic control analysis with state-level data and a difference-in-differences analysis with county-level data to estimate the relationship between the policy and changes in measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) or overall vaccine coverage, nonmedical exemptions, and medical exemptions. At the state level, the California vaccine policy was associated with a 3.3% increase in MMR vaccination coverage, a 2.4% decrease in nonmedical exemptions, and a 0.4% increase in medical exemptions. At the county level, the California vaccine policy was associated with a 4.3% increase in overall vaccination, a 3.9% decrease in nonmedical exemptions, and a 2.4% increase in medical exemptions. The largest increases in postpolicy county-level coverage occurred in counties with lower prepolicy vaccine coverage. What do these findings mean? Our study found that the 2016 California policy to eliminate nonmedical childhood vaccination exemptions was associated with an increase in vaccination coverage and a decrease in nonmedical exemptions. The study findings support the hypothesis that government policies can be an effective tool to increase vaccination coverage, especially in the most "high-risk" (low vaccine coverage) settings.
   Background Vaccine hesitancy, the reluctance or refusal to receive vaccination, is a growing public health problem in the United States and globally. State policies that eliminate nonmedical ("personal belief") exemptions to childhood vaccination requirements are controversial, and their effectiveness to improve vaccination coverage remains unclear given limited rigorous policy analysis. In 2016, a California policy (Senate Bill 277) eliminated nonmedical exemptions from school entry requirements. The objective of this study was to estimate the association between California's 2016 policy and changes in vaccine coverage. Methods and findings We used a quasi-experimental state-level synthetic control analysis and a county-level difference-in-differences analysis to estimate the impact of the 2016 California policy on vaccination coverage and prevalence of exemptions to vaccine requirements (nonmedical and medical). We used publicly available state-level data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on coverage of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination, nonmedical exemption, and medical exemption in children entering kindergarten. We used county-level data individually requested from state departments of public health on overall vaccine coverage and exemptions. Based on data availability, we included state-level data for 45 states, including California, from 2011 to 2017 and county-level data for 17 states from 2010 to 2017. The prespecified primary study outcome was MMR vaccination in the state analysis and overall vaccine coverage in the county analysis. In the state-level synthetic control analysis, MMR coverage in California increased by 3.3% relative to its synthetic control in the postpolicy period (top 2 of 43 states evaluated in the placebo tests, top 5%), nonmedical exemptions decreased by 2.4% (top 2 of 43 states evaluated in the placebo tests, top 5%), and medical exemptions increased by 0.4% (top 1 of 44 states evaluated in the placebo tests, top 2%). In the county-level analysis, overall vaccination coverage increased by 4.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.9%-5.8%, p < 0.001), nonmedical exemptions decreased by 3.9% (95% CI 2.4%-5.4%, p < 0.001), and medical exemptions increased by 2.4% (95% CI 2.0%-2.9%, p < 0.001). Changes in vaccination coverage across counties after the policy implementation from 2015 to 2017 ranged from -6% to 26%, with larger increases in coverage in counties with lower prepolicy vaccine coverage. Results were robust to alternative model specifications. The limitations of the study were the exclusion of a subset of US states from the analysis and the use of only 2 years of postpolicy data based on data availability. Conclusions In this study, implementation of the California policy that eliminated nonmedical childhood vaccine exemptions was associated with an estimated increase in vaccination coverage and a reduction in nonmedical exemptions at state and county levels. The observed increase in medical exemptions was offset by the larger reduction in nonmedical exemptions. The largest increases in vaccine coverage were observed in the most "high-risk" counties, meaning those with the lowest prepolicy vaccine coverage. Our findings suggest that government policies removing nonmedical exemptions can be effective at increasing vaccination coverage.

TI Homogeneity in the association of body mass index with type 2 diabetes

AB Background Lifestyle interventions to reduce body mass index (BMI) are critical public health strategies for type 2 diabetes prevention. While weight loss interventions have shown demonstrable benefit for high-risk and prediabetic individuals, we aimed to determine whether the same benefits apply to those at lower risk. Methods and findings We performed a multi-stratum Mendelian randomization study of the effect size of BMI on diabetes odds in 287,394 unrelated individuals of self-reported white British ancestry in the UK Biobank, who were recruited from across the United Kingdom from 2006 to 2010 when they were between the ages of 40 and 69 years. Individuals were stratified on the following diabetes risk factors: BMI, diabetes family history, and genome-wide diabetes polygenic risk score. The main outcome measure was the odds ratio of diabetes per 1-kg/m(2) BMI reduction, in the full cohort and in each stratum. Diabetes prevalence increased sharply with BMI, family history of diabetes, and genetic risk. Conversely, predicted risk reduction from weight loss was strikingly similar across BMI and genetic risk categories. Weight loss was predicted to substantially reduce diabetes odds even among lower-risk individuals: for instance, a 1-kg/m(2) BMI reduction was associated with a 1.37-fold reduction (95% CI 1.12-1.68) in diabetes odds among non-overweight individuals (BMI < 25 kg/m(2)) without a family history of diabetes, similar to that in obese individuals (BMI >= 30 kg/m(2)) with a family history (1.21-fold reduction, 95% CI 1.13-1.29). A key limitation of this analysis is that the BMI-altering DNA sequence polymorphisms it studies represent cumulative predisposition over an individual's entire lifetime, and may consequently incorrectly estimate the risk modification potential of weight loss interventions later in life. Conclusions In a population-scale cohort, lower BMI was consistently associated with reduced diabetes risk across BMI, family history, and genetic risk categories, suggesting all individuals can substantially reduce their diabetes risk through weight loss. Our results support the broad deployment of weight loss interventions to individuals at all levels of diabetes risk.
   Author summaryWhy was this study done? Excessive body weight is a key risk factor for type 2 diabetes, and weight loss is known to dramatically reduce risk, at least among people who were at high risk to begin with. However, even people without obvious risk factors like excessive weight or a family history of the disease still have a relatively large chance (about 1 percent) of developing type 2 diabetes: Could these individuals also reduce their risk of type 2 diabetes through weight loss? What did the researchers do and find? We looked at inherited genetic mutations that predispose people to lower body weight, and asked how much these mutations tend to protect people from type 2 diabetes, across 287,394 self-reported white British individuals from the UK Biobank cohort. We found that these mutations seem to offer about the same degree of protection against type 2 diabetes regardless of a person's body weight, family history of type 2 diabetes, or genetic risk for type 2 diabetes, suggesting that weight loss would have a similarly uniform protective effect for all individuals. What do these findings mean? These findings suggest that all individuals can substantially reduce their type 2 diabetes risk through weight loss, and support the broad deployment of weight loss interventions to individuals at all levels of diabetes risk as a public health measure. However, a key limitation to keep in mind is that genetic mutations, because they act across an individual's entire lifespan, are not a perfect proxy for weight loss interventions that happen only later in life.

AB Author summaryWhy was this study done? Intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetrated by men towards women is a global public health challenge and is associated with a range of poor outcomes in victims. One of the risk factors for IPV perpetration is mental disorders, but the nature and strength of the links with these disorders is uncertain, as previous studies typically measured the presence of mental disorders and perpetration of IPV at the same time, were based on small numbers, relied on self-report measures of IPV, and did not fully consider confounding factors including genetic and early family environmental factors. What did the researchers do and find? We identified men with common psychiatric disorders from a population-based sample, and compared their risk of IPV against women with that of age- and sex-matched general population controls, and also with that of their unaffected siblings to account for possible confounding familial factors. The absolute rate of IPV against women ranged from 0.1% for men with autism to 2.1% for men with drug use disorders. Most of the studied mental disorders were associated with a higher risk of IPV against women. The risk increase was 2 to 8 times compared with the general population and 2- to 4-fold compared with unaffected siblings. The highest absolute rates and relative risks for IPV perpetration were found in men with substance use disorders, and substance use comorbidity was associated with an elevated risk of IPV in other mental disorders. What do these findings mean? We found that several common mental disorders are associated with increased risk of IPV against women, and the risk is further elevated when there is a comorbidity with substance use disorders. Prevention and intervention programs should consider prioritizing assessment and treatment of IPV perpetration among individuals with psychiatric disorders, particularly those with alcohol and drug use disorders. Although the relative risk of IPV against women was higher in men with mental disorders, absolute rates of IPV were low. To reduce IPV against women, other modifiable risk factors need to be addressed.
   Background Intimate partner violence (IPV) against women is associated with a wide range of adverse outcomes. Although mental disorders have been linked to an increased risk of perpetrating IPV against women, the direction and magnitude of the association remain uncertain. In a longitudinal design, we examined the association between mental disorders and IPV perpetrated by men towards women in a population-based sample and used sibling comparisons to control for factors shared by siblings, such as genetic and early family environmental factors. Methods and findings Using Swedish nationwide registries, we identified men from 9 diagnostic groups over 1998-2013, with sample sizes ranging from 9,529 with autism to 88,182 with depressive disorder. We matched individuals by age and sex to general population controls (ranging from 186,017 to 1,719,318 controls), and calculated the hazard ratios of IPV against women. We also estimated the hazard ratios of IPV against women in unaffected full siblings (ranging from 4,818 to 37,885 individuals) compared with the population controls. Afterwards, we compared the hazard ratios for individuals with psychiatric diagnoses with those for siblings using the ratio of hazard ratios (RHR). In sensitivity analyses, we examined the contribution of previous IPV against women and common psychiatric comorbidities, substance use disorders and personality disorders. The average follow-up time across diagnoses ranged from 3.4 to 4.8 years. In comparison to general population controls, all psychiatric diagnoses studied except autism were associated with an increased risk of IPV against women in men, with hazard ratios ranging from 1.5 (95% CI 1.3-1.7) to 7.7 (7.2-8.3) (p-values < 0.001). In sibling analyses, we found that men with depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, alcohol use disorder, drug use disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and personality disorders had a higher risk of IPV against women than their unaffected siblings, with RHR values ranging from 1.7 (1.3-2.1) to 4.4 (3.7-5.2) (p-values < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses showed higher risk of IPV against women in men when comorbid substance use disorders and personality disorders were present, compared to risk when these comorbidities were absent. In addition, increased IPV risk was also found in those without previous IPV against women. The absolute rates of IPV against women ranged from 0.1% to 2.1% across diagnoses over 3.4 to 4.8 years. Individuals with alcohol use disorders (1.7%, 1,406/82,731) and drug use disorders (2.1%, 1,216/57,901) had the highest rates. Our analyses were restricted to IPV leading to arrest, suggesting that the applicability of our results may be limited to more severe forms of IPV perpetration. Conclusions Our results indicate that most of the studied mental disorders are associated with an increased risk of perpetrating IPV towards women, and that substance use disorders, as principal or comorbid diagnoses, have the highest absolute and relative risks. The findings support the development of IPV risk identification and prevention services among men with substance use disorders as an approach to reduce the prevalence of IPV.

TI Re-assessing the diversity of negative strand RNA viruses in insects

AB Author summary The diversity of insect viruses is relevant to medical, environmental, and food sciences. Our knowledge of insect viruses is highly biased because medical research has focused on mosquitoes and a few other blood-feeding species. While insects are the most diversified group of animals on the planet, the great majority of all insect species remain completely unexamined for viruses. Here we searched the most comprehensive and most evenly composed collection of insects for negative strand RNA viruses based on full transcriptomes. In 1243 insect species of all orders, we found 488 independent viral sequences encoding an RNA-directed RNA polymerase, a signature gene for RNA viruses. These data add considerably to our knowledge on viral diversity, and reveal that viruses have coevolved with insect hosts. However, our results also provide a reminder of the pitfalls associated with virus discovery and taxonomic classification in the age of metagenomics.
   The spectrum of viruses in insects is important for subjects as diverse as public health, veterinary medicine, food production, and biodiversity conservation. The traditional interest in vector-borne diseases of humans and livestock has drawn the attention of virus studies to hematophagous insect species. However, these represent only a tiny fraction of the broad diversity of Hexapoda, the most speciose group of animals. Here, we systematically probed the diversity of negative strand RNA viruses in the largest and most representative collection of insect transcriptomes from samples representing all 34 extant orders of Hexapoda and 3 orders of Entognatha, as well as outgroups, altogether representing 1243 species. Based on profile hidden Markov models we detected 488 viral RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRp) sequences with similarity to negative strand RNA viruses. These were identified in members of 324 arthropod species. Selection for length, quality, and uniqueness left 234 sequences for analyses, showing similarity to genomes of viruses classified in Bunyavirales (n = 86), Articulavirales (n = 54), and several orders within Haploviricotina (n = 94). Coding-complete genomes or nearly-complete subgenomic assemblies were obtained in 61 cases. Based on phylogenetic topology and the availability of coding-complete genomes we estimate that at least 20 novel viral genera in seven families need to be defined, only two of them monospecific. Seven additional viral clades emerge when adding sequences from the present study to formerly monospecific lineages, potentially requiring up to seven additional genera. One long sequence may indicate a novel family. For segmented viruses, cophylogenies between genome segments were generally improved by the inclusion of viruses from the present study, suggesting that in silico misassembly of segmented genomes is rare or absent. Contrary to previous assessments, significant virus-host codivergence was identified in major phylogenetic lineages based on two different approaches of codivergence analysis in a hypotheses testing framework. In spite of these additions to the known spectrum of viruses in insects, we caution that basing taxonomic decisions on genome information alone is challenging due to technical uncertainties, such as the inability to prove integrity of complete genome assemblies of segmented viruses.

TI Innate and adaptive immunity associated with resolution of acute

AB Viral and/or host factors that are directly responsible for the acute versus chronic outcome of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection have not been identified yet. Information on immune response during the early stages of HBV infection in humans is mainly derived from blood samples of patients with acute hepatitis B (AHB), which are usually obtained after the onset of clinical symptoms. Features of intrahepatic immune response in these patients are less studied due to the difficulty of obtaining multiple liver biopsies. Woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) infection in woodchucks is a model for HBV infection in humans. In the present study, five adult woodchucks were experimentally infected with WHV and then followed for 18 weeks. Blood and liver tissues were frequently collected for assaying markers of WHV replication and innate and adaptive immune responses. Liver tissues were further analyzed for pathological changes and stained for important immune cell subsets and cytokines. The increase and subsequent decline of viral replication markers in serum and liver, the elicitation of antibodies against viral proteins, and the induction of virus-specific T-cell responses indicated eventual resolution of acute WHV infection in all animals. Intrahepatic innate immune makers stayed unchanged immediately after the infection, but increased markedly during resolution, as determined by changes in transcript levels. The presence of interferon-gamma and expression of natural killer (NK) cell markers suggested that a non-cytolytic response mechanism is involved in the initial viral control in liver. This was followed by the expression of T-cell markers and cytolytic effector molecules, indicating the induction of a cytolytic response mechanism. Parallel increases in regulatory T-cell markers suggested that this cell subset participates in the overall immune cell infiltration in liver and/or has a role in regulating AHB induced by the cytolytic response mechanism. Since the transcript levels of immune cell markers in blood, when detectable, were lower than in liver, and the kinetics, except for NK-cells and interferon-gamma, did not correlate well with their intrahepatic expression, this further indicated enrichment of immune cells within liver. Conclusion: The coordinated interplay of innate and adaptive immunity mediates viral clearance in the woodchuck animal model of HBV infection. The initial presence of NK-cell associated interferon-gamma response points to an important role of this cytokine in HBV resolution.
   Author summary Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major public health concern and 257 million chronic carriers worldwide are at risk of developing serious liver disorders. Current treatment options for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) are rarely inducing viral clearance. HBV infection in immunocompetent adults is mostly asymptomatic, with a less than 5% chance of progressing to chronic infection. Contrary, more than 95% of infants infected with HBV at birth or during early childhood develop chronic infection. The viral and host factors directly deciding over the acute versus chronic outcome are largely unknown. Understanding the features of innate and adaptive immune responses during acute, self-limiting HBV infection will aid the understanding of underlying mechanisms responsible for HBV resolution, and thus support the design of immunomodulatory drugs for treatment of CHB. However, studying acute hepatitis B (AHB) in humans is challenging due to its asymptomatic nature and the limitations in obtaining multiple liver biopsies. Infection of adult woodchucks with the HBV-like woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) is a suitable model for studying AHB. Our comprehensive work describes the kinetics of viral replication and associated innate and adaptive immune responses, both in liver and blood, during resolution of AHB in the woodchuck model.

AB Sexually transmitted infections are a critical public health issue. However, the mechanisms underlying sexually transmitted infections in women and the link between the infection mechanism and the wide range of clinical outcomes remain elusive due to a lack of research models mimicking human infection in vivo. We established a human cervical tissue explant model to mimic local Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) infections. We found that GC preferentially colonize the ectocervix by activating integrin-beta 1, which inhibits epithelial shedding. GC selectively penetrate into the squamocolumnar junction (TZ) and endocervical epithelia by inducing beta-catenin phosphorylation, which leads to E-cadherin junction disassembly. Epithelial cells in various cervical regions differentially express carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs), the host receptor for GC opacity-associated proteins (Opa(CEA)). Relatively high levels were detected on the luminal membrane of ecto/endocervical epithelial cells but very low levels intracellularly in TZ epithelial cells. CEACAM-Opa(CEA) interaction increased ecto/endocervical colonization and reduced endocervical penetration by increasing integrin-beta 1 activation and inhibiting beta-catenin phosphorylation respectively, through CEACAM downstream signaling. Thus, the intrinsic properties of cervical epithelial cells and phase-variation of bacterial surface molecules both play a role in controlling GC infection mechanisms and infectivity, preferential colonization or penetration, potentially leading to asymptomatic or symptomatic infection.
   Author summary Gonorrhea, caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC), is a common sexually transmitted infection and has become a public health crisis due to a steady increase in antibiotic-resistant cases. How GC infect the female reproductive tract (FRT) and cause various clinical outcomes is still unknown. This study used human cervical explants to examine the mechanism by which GC infect the heterogeneous mucosa of the human cervix, the gate of the FRT. We show that GC preferentially colonize stratified epithelial cells in the vaginal-cervical region by enhancing epithelial cell adherence. GC selectively penetrate into tissues of the squamocolumnar junction and cervical-endometrial regions but not the vaginal-cervical region by loosening epithelial cell-cell junctions. The expression of opacity-associated proteins on GC regulates the infection patterns depending on the expression of the host receptors on various types of epithelia and receptor downstream signaling. These data suggest that both intrinsic properties of cervical epithelial cells and phase-variation of bacterial surface molecules play a role in determining GC infectivity. Our findings can explain how GC infection leads to asymptomatic or symptomatic infection.

AB It is well recognised that animal and plant pathogens form complex ecological communities of interacting organisms within their hosts, and there is growing interest in the health implications of such pathogen interactions. Although community ecology approaches have been used to identify pathogen interactions at the within-host scale, methodologies enabling robust identification of interactions from population-scale data such as that available from health authorities are lacking. To address this gap, we developed a statistical framework that jointly identifies interactions between multiple viruses from contemporaneous non-stationary infection time series. Our conceptual approach is derived from a Bayesian multivariate disease mapping framework. Importantly, our approach captures within- and between-year dependencies in infection risk while controlling for confounding factors such as seasonality, demographics and infection frequencies, allowing genuine pathogen interactions to be distinguished from simple correlations. We validated our framework using a broad range of synthetic data. We then applied it to diagnostic data available for five respiratory viruses co-circulating in a major urban population between 2005 and 2013: adenovirus, human coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial virus. We found positive and negative covariances indicative of epidemiological interactions among specific virus pairs. This statistical framework enables a community ecology perspective to be applied to infectious disease epidemiology with important utility for public health planning and preparedness.
   Author summary Disease-causing microorganisms, including viruses, bacteria, protozoa and fungi, form complex communities within animals and plants. These microorganisms can coexist harmoniously or even beneficially, or they may competitively interact for host resources. Well-studied examples include interactions between viruses and bacteria in the respiratory tract. Whilst ecological studies have revealed that some pathogens do interact within their hosts, identifying interactions from available population scale data from health authorities is challenging. This is exacerbated by a lack of large-scale data describing the infection patterns of multiple pathogens within single populations over long time frames. Furthermore, methods for evaluating whether infection frequencies of different pathogens fluctuate together or not over time cannot readily account for alternative explanations. For example, human pathogens may have related seasonal patterns depending on the age groups they infect and the weather conditions they survive in, and not because they are interacting. We developed a robust statistical framework to identify pathogen-pathogen interactions from population scale diagnostic data. This framework serves as a crucial step in identifying such important interactions and will guide new studies to elucidate their underpinning mechanisms. This will have important consequences for public health preparedness and the design of effective disease control interventions.

ID REASONS
AB Background There is a large and unexplained variation in referral rates to specialists by general practitioners, which calls for investigations regarding general practitioners' perceptions and expectations during the referral process. Our objective was to describe the decision-making process underlying referral of patients to specialists by general practitioners working in a university outpatient primary care center. Methods Two focus groups were conducted among general practitioners (10 residents and 8 chief residents) working in the Center for Primary Care and Public Health (Unisante) of the University of Lausanne, in Switzerland. Focus group data were analyzed with thematic content analysis. A feedback group of general practitioners validated the results. Results Participating general practitioners distinguished two kinds of situations regarding referral: a) "clear-cut situations", in which the decision to refer or not seems obvious and b) "complex cases", in which they hesitate to refer or not. Regarding the "complex cases", they reported various types of concerns: a) about the treatment, b) about the patient and the doctor-patient relationship and c) about themselves. General practitioners evoked numerous reasons for referring, including non-medical factors such as influencing patients' emotions, earning specialists' esteem or sharing responsibility. They also explained that they seek validation by colleagues and postpone referral so as to relieve some of the decision-related distress. Conclusions General practitioners' referral of patients to specialists cannot be explained in biomedical terms only. It seems necessary to take into account the fact that referral is a sensitive topic for general practitioners, involving emotionally charged interactions and relationships with patients, colleagues, specialists and supervisors. The decision to refer or not is influenced by multiple contextual, personal and clinical factors that dynamically interact and shape the decision-making process.

The disease is endemic in Uganda, with 40% of the districts in the country affected in 2016, when 42 out of 112 districts notified the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Program (NTLP) of at least one case of leprosy. We determined the spatial and temporal trends of leprosy in Uganda during 2012-2016 to inform control measures. Methods We analyzed quarterly leprosy case-finding data, reported from districts to the Uganda National Leprosy Surveillance system (managed by NTLP) during 2012-2016. We calculated new case detection by reporting district and administrative regions of treatment during this period. New case detection was defined as new leprosy cases diagnosed by the Uganda health services divided by regional population; population estimates were based on 2014 census data. We used logistic regression analysis in Epi-Info version 7.2.0 to determine temporal trends. Population estimates were based on 2014 census data. We used QGIS software to draw choropleth maps showing leprosy case detection rates, assumed to approximate the new case detection rates, per 100,000 population. Results During 2012-2016, there was 7% annual decrease in reported leprosy cases in Uganda each year (p = 0.0001), largely driven by declines in the eastern (14%/year, p = 0.0008) and central (11%/year, p = 0.03) regions. Declines in reported cases in the western (9%/year, p = 0.12) and northern (4%/year, p = 0.16) regions were not significant. The combined new case detection rates from 2012 to 2016 for the ten most-affected districts showed that 70% were from the northern region, 20% from the eastern, 10% from the western and 10% from the central regions. Conclusion There was a decreasing trend in leprosy new case detection in Uganda during 2012-2016; however, the declining trends were not consistent in all regions. The Northern region consistently identified more leprosy cases compared to the other regions. We recommend evaluation of the leprosy surveillance system to ascertain the leprosy situation.

ID ADHERENCE
AB Background The identification and treatment of LTBI is a key component of the WHO's strategy to eliminate TB. Recent migrants from high TB-incidence countries are recognised to be at risk TB reactivation, and many high-income countries have focused on LTBI screening and treatment programmes for this group. However, migrants are the group least likely to complete the LTBI cascade-of-care. This pragmatic cluster-randomised, parallel group, superiority trial investigates whether a model of care based entirely within a community setting (primary care) will improve treatment completion compared with treatment in specialist TB services (secondary care). Methods The CATAPuLT trial (Completion and Acceptability of Treatment Across Primary Care and the community for Latent Tuberculosis) randomised 34 general practices in London, England, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment for LBTI in recent migrants within primary care. GP practices were randomised to either provide management for LTBI entirely within primary care (GPs and community pharmacists) or to refer patients to secondary care. The target recruitment number for individuals is 576. The primary outcome is treatment completion (defined as taking at least 90% of antibiotic doses). The secondary outcomes assess adherence, acceptance of treatment, the incidence of adverse effects including drug-induced liver injury, the rates of active TB, patient satisfaction and cost-effectiveness of LTBI treatment. This protocol adheres to the SPIRIT Checklist. Discussion The CATAPuLT trial seeks to provide implementation research evidence for a patient-centred intervention to improve treatment completion for LTBI amongst recent migrants to the UK.

AB Background Little is known about the clustering of behavioral health risk factors (HRFs), namely the occurrence of 16 specific combinations of tobacco smoking, at-risk alcohol use, overweight and physical inactivity in general hospital patients. Furthermore, social inequalities in HRFs, health and life expectancy are a major concern in public health. In order to establish the need for screening and intervention in general hospital care, the study aimed to determine the co-occurrence of HRFs in patients in four medical departments, and to investigate differences by gender, age and socio-economic characteristics. Methods Over 17 months, a systematic multiple HRF screening was conducted at one general hospital in northeastern Germany. In total, 6251 18-64 year old patients (92% of eligibles) participated. Proportions and confidence intervals were calculated for all 16 HRF profiles stratified by department, gender, age group, school education, and employment status. Results In total, 92.2% of the participants (58.6% male) reported >= 1 HRF, and 65.7% >= 2 HRFs. Men (71.2%), patients aged 35-49 (67.9%) and 50-64 years (69.5%), lower educated (79.0%), and unemployed (77.8%) patients had larger proportions of >= 2 HRFs than their counterparts. In all departments, the most common HRF profiles included overweight. HRF profiles that included alcohol and/ or smoking were more common in ear-nose-throat and trauma surgery than in internal medicine and general surgery patients. Men had higher rates concerning almost all HRF profiles including >= 2 HRFs and alcohol; women concerning profiles that included <= 2 HRFs and inactivity. In older patients, profiles with >= 2 HRFs including overweight; and in younger patients, profiles with smoking and/or alcohol were more common. In lower educated patients, profiles with >= 2 HRFs including inactivity; and in higher educated patients profiles with <= 2 HRFs including alcohol were more common. Compared to others, unemployed patients had higher rates of profiles with >= 3 HRFs including smoking. Conclusions Two in three patients require interventions targeting two or more HRFs. The findings help to develop screening and brief intervention for patients with specific health risk profiles, that can reach most patients, including those most in need and those most hard to reach, with socio-economically disadvantaged people in particular.

ID DIAGNOSIS; CHILDREN
AB Background Hearing loss is a prevalent sensorineural disorder and a major public health issue in China. It is suggested that half of all cases of hearing loss can be prevented through public health measures. However, national strategies for hearing healthcare are not implemented well in Guangdong and some other regions in China. Methods To develop a community-based service model for the prevention and control of hearing loss in Guangdong, we integrated the model with multiple maternal and child healthcare models, and set up a series of clinical programs along with an optimum timeline for the preventive measures and intervention treatments to take place. A total of 36,090 families were enrolled in the study, including 358 high-risk families and 35,732 general-risk families. Results The study lasted for 6.5 years, and 30,769 children were born during that period. A total of 42 children were born with congenital deafness; 17 of them were born into families with advanced genetic risks for hearing loss, 9 were born with specific medical conditions, and 16 were born into general-risk families. About one third of them were diagnosed prenatally, others were diagnosed within 3 months of age, and 72% of them received interventions initiated before 6 months of age. 13 children presented with delayed hearing loss; 9 of them were diagnosed with delayed hereditary sensorineural deafness in neonatal period, and 4 were diagnosed within 3 months after onset. Timely interventions were provided to them, with appropriate referrals and follow-ups. Beside these, 80 families were identified with genetic susceptibility to aminoglycoside ototoxicity. Detailed medication guides were provided to prevent aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss. Moreover, through health education and risk reduction strategies, the prevalence of TORCH syndrome decreased from 10.7 to 5.2 per 10,000. Additionaly, the awareness rates of health knowledge about hearing healthcare significantly increased in the cohort. Conclusions Adapting national strategies for local or district projects could be an important step in implementing hearing loss prevention measures, and developing community-based service models could be of importance in carrying them out.

ID VIRUS INFECTION; EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Background Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection creates a global health burden with significant morbidity and mortality. Healthcare workers, including nurses and midwives, are at higher risk of acquiring the disease. While health-related behaviours are affected by different aspects of knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP), there are few studies examining the KAP level of healthcare workers towards HBV infection in Sudan. The purpose of this study was to examine the KAP level of nurses and midwives towards HBV virus infection in Khartoum, Sudan. Methods A cross-sectional descriptive hospital-based study was conducted in two public maternity hospitals (Saudi and Saad Abul-Eleella hospitals) in Khartoum state of, Sudan. A pre-tested structured questionnaire was constructed and implemented to examine KAP towards HBV infection. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version of 21 was utilized to conduct statistical analysis and examine the data at hand. Chi-square test was used implemented to determine the relationship between categorical variables. Results A total of 110 nurses and midwives from the both hospitals participated in this study. More than half of the respondents (58.2%) had an average level of knowledge, two-third of the respondents had a safe practice, and the majority of the respondents had a favourable attitude towards HBV preventive measures. Approximately half of the participants (51.8%) had a history of needle stick injuries. Half of the participants had inaccurate concepts about post exposure prophylaxis to HBV infection, while more than half of the nurses and midwives didn't complete the vaccination schedule for HBV. Conclusion Most of the nurses and midwives in Saudi and Saad Abul-Eleella hospitals were aware of HBV infection. However, a significant proportion of the participants lack the requisite knowledge about post exposure management. The study revealed a low level of HBV vaccination coverage rate and a high rate of needle stick injuries. Further strategies for preventing workplace exposure, training programs on HBV infection, including post exposure prophylaxis, and increasing vaccination coverage rate of all HCWS are highly recommended.

AB Background Child low and high birth weight are important public health problems. Many studies have looked at factors of low and high birth weight using mean regression. This study aimed at using quantile regression to find out determinants of low and high birth weight. Methods Spatial quantile regression models at 0.05 and 0.95 percentiles of birth weight were fitted to 13,087 children birth weight in kilograms using Malawi demographic health survey data of 2010 study. Full Bayesian method by integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) was used to estimate the model. Second order random walk priors were assigned for mother age and antenatal visits for pregnancy while Gaussian markov random field prior was used for district of the child. Results Residual spatial patterns reveal areas in the southern region promoting high birth weight while areas in the central and northern region promote low birth weight. Most fixed effects findings are consistent with the literature. Richest family, normal mother body mass index (BMI), mother over weight (BMI > 25 kg/m(2)), birth order 2-3, mother secondary education and height (>= 150 cm) negate low birth weight while weight 45-70 kg promote low birth weight. Birth order category 6+, mother height (>= 150 cm) and poor wealth quintile, promote high birth weight, while richer and richest wealth quintiles and education categories: primary, secondary, and higher, and mother overweight (BMI > 25 kg/m(2)) reduce high birth weight. Antenatal visits for pregnancy reduce both low and high birth weight. Conclusion Strategies to reduce low and high birth weight should simultaneously address mother education, weight gain during pregnancy and poverty while targeting areas increasing low and high birth weight.

AB Background HIV testing is an integral component of HIV prevention, treatment and care and, therefore, is crucial in achieving UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets. HIV testing in Kenya follows both the voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) and provider initiated testing and counselling (PITC) models. However, little is known about the individual experiences of undergoing an HIV test in the two testing models. This study provides experiential evidence of undergoing an HIV test in a resource poor urban slum setting. Methods The study explored testing experiences and challenges faced in respect to ensuring the 3 Cs (consent, counselling and confidentiality), using in-depth interviews (N = 41) with HIV-infected men and women in two slum settlements of Nairobi City. The in-depth interview respondents were aged above 18 years with 56% being females. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and then translated into English. The transcribed data were analysed using thematic analysis method. Results The respondent HIV-testing experiences were varied and greatly shaped by circumstances and motivation for HIV testing. The findings show both positive and negative experiences, with sporadic adherence to the 3Cs principle in both HIV testing models. Although some respondents were satisfied with the HIV testing process, a number of them raised a number of concerns, with instances of coercion and testing without consent being reported. Conclusion The 3Cs (consent, counselling and confidentiality) principle must underlie HIV testing and counselling practices in order to achieve positive testing outcomes. The study concludes that adherence to the 3Cs during HIV testing contributes to both the individual and public health good - irrespective of whether testing is initiated by the individual or by the health provider.

TI Expanding access to maternal, newborn and primary healthcare services
   through private-community-government partnership clinic models in rural
   Kenya: the Ubuntu-Afya kiosk model
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Maternal and newborn health; Primary healthcare; Public-private
   partnership
AB Background Fifteen counties contribute 98.7% of the maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality in Kenya. The dismal maternal and newborn (MNH) outcomes in these settings are mostly attributable to limited access to skilled MNH services. Public health services are stretched and limited in reach, and many social programmes are not sustainably designed. We implemented a network of 16 self-sustaining community medical centres (Ubuntu-Afya Kiosks) in Homa Bay County, to facilitate access to MNH and other primary health services. We investigated the effect of these centres on MNH access indicators over a 2-year period of initial implementation. Methods We conducted a baseline and end-line survey in June 2016 and May 2018 respectively, in 10 community health units (CHU) served by Ubuntu-Afya Kiosks. We targeted women of child bearing age, ensuring equal sample across the 10 CHUs. The surveys were powered to detect a 10% increase in the proportion of women who deliver under a skilled birth attendant from a perceived baseline of 55%. Background characteristics of the respondents were compared using Fisher's exact test for the categorical data. STATA 'svy' commands were used to calculate confidence intervals for the proportions taking into account the clustering within CHU. Results The coverage of antenatal care during previous pregnancy was 99% at end-line compared to 81% at baseline. Seventy one percent of mothers attended at least four antenatal care visits, compared to 64% at baseline. The proportion of women who delivered under a skilled birth attendant during previous pregnancy was higher at end-line (90%) compared to baseline (85%). There was an increase in the proportion of women who had their newborns examined within 2 day of delivery from 74 to 92% at end-line. A considerable proportion of the respondents visited private clinics at end-line (31%) compared to 3% at baseline. Conclusions Ubuntu-Afya Kiosks were associated with enhanced access to MNH care, with significant improvements observed in newborn examination within 2 days after delivery. More women sought care from private clinics at end-line compared to baseline, indicating potential for private sector in supporting health service delivery gaps in under-served settings.

ID HEALTH SYSTEM REFORM; PUBLIC HOSPITALS; CHINA; CARE; INCENTIVES
AB Background In September 2012, Beijing, the capital of China, selected five tertiary hospitals as pilots to remove the previously allowed 15% markup for drug sales. However, while most research demonstrated the significant decrease in drug sales, the core issue of high health expenditure was not well solved because of the unintended policy impact. This study aimed to empirically evaluate the short-term and long-term unintended impacts on controlling medical expenses of Beijing's zero markup drug policy from 2012 to 2015. Methods This study extracted 2012-2015 individual-level data from the Beijing Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) database and performed a propensity score-matched analysis to evaluate the short-term and long-term impacts on controlling medical expenses. All inpatients in the 5 pilot reform hospitals were selected as the intervention group, while inpatients in other tertiary hospitals were selected as the control group. Results A total of 520,996 inpatients were extracted in this study. For patients in the pilot hospitals, the total expenditures per admission decreased from 17,140.3 yuan in 2012 to 15,430.1 yuan in 2013 and then increased to 16,789.8 yuan in 2015. Expenditure on drugs reduced from 5811.7 yuan in 2012 to 3903.4 yuan in 2015. However, a significant substitution effect of medical consumables was first observed in the third quarter of 2014, which undermined the impact of the policy. In the long-term, the intervention group and control group demonstrated the same trend. Conclusions After the zero markup drug policy, expenditure on drugs revealed a continuous decline. However, the decline in total expenditure was weakened by the substitution effect of medical consumables in the long term.

AB Background Failure to seek treatment for mental health disorders is a serious public health concern. Unfortunately, there is little insight into help-seeking and its associated factors in China which has undergone rapid economic development in the past 30 years and has an increasing prevalence of mental disorder. Therefore, this study aimed to (1) investigate help-seeking rates in healthcare and non-healthcare settings and (2) investigate the correlates of help-seeking behavior in a large Chinese survey. Methods Data came from the Tianjin Mental Health Survey (TJMHS), a representative sample of adult community residents in the Chinese municipality of Tianjin (n = 11,748). Of these, 1759 individuals had >= 1 axis-I diagnosis according to the Diagnostic and Statistical manual- fourth edition (DSM-IV) and were administered a Help-Seeking Questionnaire. Results 15.7% of patients reported that they had ever sought help during their entire lifetime before the interview, with 4.5% seeking help in mental healthcare, 3.2% in other healthcare and 8.1% in non-healthcare settings (e.g., family, friends, and spiritual advisor). Among help-seekers, the first help was mostly sought in non-healthcare settings (58.4%), followed by healthcare (27.5%) and mental healthcare settings (24.5%). Female gender, younger age, having 7-9 years vs 0-6 years of education, a low income, a psychotic disorder and having >= 2 disorders were associated with increased help-seeking. Older age, being married and having a psychotic or organic disorder were associated with increased help-seeking in healthcare vs. non-healthcare settings. Conclusion A small percentage of persons with mental disorders in the Tianjin region seek help and among those who do, variations in the types of help-seeking may be partially explained by demographic and clinical characteristics.

AB Background Globally, tuberculosis (TB) lasts a major public health concern. Using feasible strategies to estimate TB infectious periods is crucial. The aim of this study was to determine the magnitude of TB infectious period and associated factors in East Gojjam zone. Methods An institution-based prospective study was conducted among 348 pulmonary TB (PTB) cases between December 2017 and December 2018. TB cases were recruited from all health facilities located in Hulet Eju Enesie, Enebse Sarmider, Debay Tilatgen, Dejen, Debre-Markos town administration, and Machakel districts. Data were collected through an exit interview using a structured questionnaire and analyzed by IBM SPSS version25. The TB infectious period of each patient category was determined using the TB management time and sputum smear conversion time. The sum of the infectious period of each patient category gave the infectious pool of the study area. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with the magnitude of TB infectious period. Results Of the total participated PTB cases, 209(60%) were male, 226(65%) aged < 30 years, 205(59%) were from the rural settings, and 77 (22%) had comorbidities. The magnitude of the TB infectious pool in the study area was 78,031 infectious person-days. The undiagnosed TB cases (44,895 days), smear-positive (14,625 days) and smear-negative (12,995 days) were major contributors to the infectious pool. The overall average median TB management time was 142.4 days (IQR, 98-238 days). Similarly, the average sputum smear conversion time of PTB cases (new and repeat) was 46 days. Residence, knowledge, form of TB, smoking, alcohol history, distance from the facility, comorbidity history and stigma were statistically significant factors TB infectious period (p-value< 0.05). Conclusions The magnitude of the TB infectious pool is high even if it is lower than the findings of previous studies. This might be an indicator of poor access to TB services, service delays, low community awareness, impaired facility readiness, and poor transportation. Improving personal awareness and behavior, timely management of commodities, and using the TB management time in TB control are crucial to improving TB control activities.

AB Background Over the past decade, smartphone use has become widespread amongst today's children and young people (CYP) which parallels increases in poor mental health in this group. Simultaneously, media concern abounds about the existence of 'smartphone addiction' or problematic smartphone use. There has been much recent research concerning the prevalence of problematic smartphone use is in children and young people who use smartphones, and how this syndrome relates to mental health outcomes, but this has not been synthesized and critically evaluated. Aims To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the prevalence of PSU and quantify the association with mental health harms. Methods A search strategy using Medical Subject Headings was developed and adapted for eight databases between January 1, 1st 2011 to October 15th 2017. No language restriction was applied. Of 924 studies identified, 41 were included in this review, three of which were cohort studies and 38 were cross sectional studies. The mental health outcomes were self-reported: depression; anxiety; stress; poor sleep quality; and decreased educational attainment, which were synthesized according to an a priori protocol. Results The studies included 41,871 CYP, and 55% were female. The median prevalence of PSU amongst CYP was 23.3% (14.0-31.2%). PSU was associated with an increased odds of depression (OR = 3.17;95%CI 2.30-4.37;I-2 = 78%); increased anxiety (OR = 3.05 95%CI 2.64-3.53;I-2 = 0%); higher perceived stress (OR = 1.86;95%CI 1.24-2.77;I-2 = 65%); and poorer sleep quality (OR = 2.60; 95%CI; 1.39-4.85, I-2 = 78%). Conclusions PSU was reported in approximately one in every four CYP and accompanied by an increased odds of poorer mental health. PSU is an evolving public health concern that requires greater study to determine the boundary between helpful and harmful technology use. Policy guidance is needed to outline harm reduction strategies.

AB Background Evidences from various parts of the world reveal that women with disabilities are facing widespread barriers in accessing public services. Service providers and program managers do not grasp the relevance of their work and interventions in addressing the sexual and reproductive health needs of women with disabilities. The present study therefore aimed to assess family planning knowledge and practice among women with sensory disabilities. Methods A mixed method approach using quantitative and qualitative methods was employed to collect the data. The study included 326 blind and deaf women using respondent driven sampling technique and 29 purposely selected key informants. We carried out the study from August 2016-April 2017. The quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS and the qualitative analysis was done using Open code software version 4.02 and triangulated with the quantitative findings. Results The findings showed that nearly two third of the respondents of were sexually active. The majority (97.2%) of study respondents had heard about FP methods, however the level of comprehensive knowledge on modern contraceptive methods was 32.5%. The prevalence of unwanted pregnancy was 67.0% and abortion was 44%. Almost half of sexually active respondents ever used modern contraceptive methods, yet the contraceptive prevalence at the time of survey was 31.1%. Implants were the most commonly used (51%) contraceptive method among current users. Conclusions The use of modern contraceptive methods among women with sensory disabilities was low. Thus, the government and concerned organizations need to address the attitudinal, social, and physical barriers women with sensory disabilities are facing while seeking, accessing to and using family planning services.

AB Background This paper describes the implementation and evaluation of a clinical pharmacy practice (CPP) course in Northern Cyprus. The course covered a range of subjects, including internal medicine, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and drug information services. Methods An 8-week structured CPP course was designed for fifth-year students. Students' competencies were assessed using an objective structural clinical examination (OSCE) before and after the intervention. The course addressed all CPP competence domains and learning outcomes, and it utilized a wide variety of learning activities. Student perceptions, experience and preceptor evaluations were assessed using surveys. Results Students reported that the learning objectives of the course were met. Substantial knowledge and skills in different areas of CPP were gained. A significant overall enhancement in the average grades on the OSCE was identified (23.09 +/- 0.75 and 27.51 +/- 0.71 out of 40). Students received the highest scores in drug information data retrieval and interpretation (4.4 +/- 0.13), communication skills (4.2 +/- 0.09) and public health promotion (3.92 +/- 0.12). The lowest scores were recorded in clinical prescription management problems (2.5 +/- 0.23) and pharmacotherapy application (2.54 +/- 0.18). Conclusion Students' scores significantly improved from the baseline in the core competence domains. Most students found the structure, process and outcomes of the course to be beneficial and satisfactory.

TI Primary healthcare and school health service utilisation by adolescents
   and young adults in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE South Africa; Adolescent; Health services; Young adult
ID INFORMATION-SYSTEM
AB Background: Young people aged 10-24 years are a vulnerable group with poor health service access relative to other populations. Recent South African initiatives, the She Conquers campaign, the Integrated School Health Policy and the Adolescent & Youth Health Policy, include a focus on improving the breadth and quality of youth-friendly health service delivery. However, in some settings the provision and impact of scaled-up youth friendly health services has been limited indicating a gap between policy and implementation. In this study we reviewed existing sources of data on health service utilisation to answer the following question: 'What health conditions do young people present with and what services do they receive at public health clinics, mobile clinics and school health services?'
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective register review in three purposively selected primary healthcare clinics (PHCC), one mobile clinic, and one school health team in Hlabisa and Mtubatuba sub-districts of uMkhanyakude District, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The focus was service utilisation for any reason by 10-24 year olds. We also conducted descriptive analysis of pre-existing data on service utilisation by young people available from the District Health Information System for all 17 PHCC in the study sub-districts.
   Results: Three quarters of 4121 recorded young person visits in the register review were by females, and 40% of all young person visits were by females aged 20-24 years. The most common presenting conditions were HIV-related, antenatal care, family planning, general non-specific complaints and respiratory problems (excluding TB). There were relatively few recorded consultations for other common conditions affecting young people such as mental health and nutritional problems. Antibiotics, antiretrovirals, contraceptives, vitamins/supplements, and analgesics were most commonly provided. Routine health registers recorded limited information, were often incomplete and/or inconsistent, and age was not routinely recorded.
   Conclusions: Measuring morbidity and service provision are fundamental to informing policy and promoting responsive health systems. Efforts should be intensified to improve the quality and completeness of health registers, with attention to the documentation of important, and currently poorly documented, young people's health issues such as mental health and nutrition.

AB Background: Patient safety is a key target in public health, health services and medicine. Communication between all parties involved in gynecology and obstetrics (clinical staff/professionals, expectant mothers/patients and their partners, close relatives or friends providing social support) should be improved to ensure patient safety, including the avoidance of preventable adverse events (pAEs). Therefore, interventions including an app will be developed in this project through a participatory approach integrating two theoretical models. The interventions will be designed to support participants in their communication with each other and to overcome difficulties in everyday hospital life. The aim is to foster effective communication in order to reduce the frequency of pAEs. If communication is improved, clinical staff should show an increase in work satisfaction and patients should show an increase in patient satisfaction.
   Methods: The study will take place in two maternity clinics in Germany. In line with previous studies of complex interventions, it is divided into three interdependent phases. Each phase provides its own methods and data. Phase 1: Needs assessment and a training for staff (n = 140) tested in a pre-experimental study with a pre/post-design. Phase 2: Assessment of communication training for patients and their social support providers (n = 423) in a randomized controlled study. Phase 3: Assessment of an app supporting the communication between staff, patients, and their social support providers (n = 423) in a case-control study. The primary outcome is improvement of communication competencies. A range of other implementation outcomes will also be assessed (i.e. pAEs, patient/treatment satisfaction, work satisfaction, safety culture, training-related outcomes).
   Discussion: This is the first large intervention study on communication and patient safety in gynecology and obstetrics integrating two theoretical models that have not been applied to this setting. It is expected that the interventions, including the app, will improve communication practice which is linked to a lower probability of pAEs. The app will offer an effective and inexpensive way to promote effective communication independent of users' motivation. Insights gained from this study can inform other patient safety interventions and health policy developments.

ID INFECTIOUS-MONONUCLEOSIS; UNIVERSITY-STUDENTS; VACCINE; INFANTS
AB Background Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an important human pathogen which causes lifelong infection of > 90% people globally and is linked to infectious mononucleosis (arising from infection in the later teenage years) and several types of cancer. Vaccines against EBV are in development. In order to determine the most cost-effective public health strategy for vaccine deployment, setting-specific data on the age at EBV acquisition and risk factors for early infection are required. Such data are also important to inform mathematical models of EBV transmission that can determine the required target product profile of vaccine characteristics. We thus aimed to examine risk factors for EBV infection in young people in England, in order to improve our understanding of EBV epidemiology and guide future vaccination strategies. Methods The Health Survey for England (HSE) is an annual, cross-sectional representative survey of households in England during which data are collected via questionnaires and blood samples. We randomly selected individuals who participated in the HSE 2002, aiming for 25 participants of each sex in each single year age group from 11 to 24 years. Stored samples were tested for EBV and cytomegalovirus (CMV) antibodies. We undertook descriptive and regression analyses of EBV seroprevalence and risk factors for infection. Results Demographic data and serostatus were available for 732 individuals. EBV seroprevalence was strongly associated with age, increasing from 60.4% in 11-14 year olds throughout adolescence (68.6% in 15-18 year olds) and stabilising by early adulthood (93.0% in those aged 22-24 years). In univariable and multivariable logistic regression models, ethnicity was associated with serostatus (adjusted odds ratio for seropositivity among individuals of other ethnicity versus white individuals 2.33 [95% confidence interval 1.13-4.78]). Smoking was less strongly associated with EBV seropositivity. Conclusions By the age of 11 years, EBV infection is present in over half the population, although age is not the only factor associated with serostatus. Knowledge of the distribution of infection in the UK population is critical for determining future vaccination policies, e.g. comparing general versus selectively targeted vaccination strategies.

AB Background There is a great need to identify implementation strategies to successfully scale-up public health interventions in order to achieve their intended population impact. The Out-of-school Nutrition and Physical Activity group-randomized trial previously demonstrated improvements in children's vigorous physical activity and the healthfulness of foods and beverages consumed. This implementation study aimed to assess the effects and costs of two training models to scale-up this evidence-based intervention. Methods A 3-arm group-randomized trial was conducted to compare effectiveness of in-person and online training models for scaling up the intervention compared to controls. One-third of sites were randomized to the in-person train-the-trainer model: local YMCA facilitators attended a training session and then conducted three learning collaborative meetings and technical assistance. One-third were assigned to the online model, consisting of self-paced monthly learning modules, videos, quizzes, and facilitated discussion boards. Remaining sites served as controls. Fifty-three afterschool sites from three YMCA Associations in different regions of the country completed baseline and follow-up observations using a validated tool of afterschool nutrition and physical activity practices. We used multivariable regression models, accounting for clustering of observations, to assess intervention effects on an aggregate afterschool practice primary outcome, and conducted secondary analyses of nine intervention goals (e.g. serving water). Cost data were collected to determine the resources to implement each training model. Results Changes in the primary outcome indicate that, on average, sites in the in-person arm achieved 0.44 additional goals compared to controls (95%CI 0.02, 0.86, p = 0.04). Increases in the number of additional goals achieved in sites in the online arm were not significantly greater than control sites (+ 0.28, 95% CI -0.18, 0.73, p = 0.24). Goal-specific improvements were observed for increasing water offered in the in-person arm and fruits and vegetables offered in the online arm. The cost per person trained was $678 for the in-person training model and $336 for the on-line training model. Conclusions This pilot trial presents promising findings on implementation strategies for scale-up. It validated the in-person training model as an effective approach. The less expensive online training may be a useful option for geographically disbursed sites where in-person training is challenging.

AB Background Combined with the increasing life expectancy, chronic medical conditions have gradually become the dominant cause of death and disability, and multimorbidity became an increasingly serious public health challenge. However, most existing studies have focused on the coexistence of specific diseases or relatively few diseases. Given one person may have multiple diseases at the same time, we applied Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) to systematically evaluate one's 10-year mortality. In this study, we explored the effects of nutrients and physical activity on CCI using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013-2014 data. Methods The study sample consists of one continuous cycle (2013-2014) of NHANES, and 4386 subjects were included in the study. Nutrients intake was measured by dietary recall, and physical activity was evaluated by the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire respectively. Besides, CCI was the sum of the scores assigned for each medical condition. We utilized zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model to investigate the effects in nutrients intake and physical activity on CCI by adjusting for seven sociodemographic characteristics, smoking and drinking. Results Among the 4386 participants, 2018 (68.7%) are Non-Hispanic White, over half participants (78.6%) drink. In count part (CCI >= 0), holding other variables constant, the expected change in CCI for a one-unit increase in niacin is 1.621(RR = 1.621, p = 0.016), in lutein + zeaxanthin is 0.974 (RR = 0.974, p = 0.031), and in sedentary time is 1.035 (RR = 1.035, p = 0.005). Moreover, those who do not have vigorous work activity would be more likely to have higher CCI than those who have (RR = 1.275, P = 0.045). In logit part (CCI = 0), the log odds of having CCI equals zero would increase by 0.541 and 0.708 for every additional vigorous recreational activity (OR = 0.541, p = 0.004) and moderate recreational activity (OR = 0.708, p = 0.017) respectively. Conclusions Lutein and zeaxanthin intake, vigorous work activity, vigorous recreational activity and moderate recreational activity may be good for one's health. Rather, increasing niacin intake and sedentary activity may be likely to raise 10-year mortality. Our findings may be significant for preventing diseases and improving health, furthermore, reducing people's financial burden on healthcare.

SO PLOS ONE

ID DENTAL-CARIES; ASSOCIATION; RELIABILITY; KNOWLEDGE
AB The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the ability to recognize and read oral health terms is associated with the number of teeth with cavitated carious lesions in adolescents. A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted involving a sample of 746 adolescents representative of students aged 15 to 19 years at the public and private school systems in a city in northeast Brazil. Two examiners who had undergone a training and calibration exercise (inter-examiner and intra-examiner Kappa coefficient: 0.87 to 0.93) performed the diagnosis of caries using the Nyvad Index and evaluated the level of OHL (BREALD-30) of the adolescents. The participants answered questions regarding their history of visits to the dentist and the parents/caregivers answered a questionnaire addressing socioeconomic characteristics. A directed acyclic graph was created to direct the selection of covariables for adjustments in the Poisson multiple regression analysis to test the association between dental caries and OHL (alpha = 5%). Cavitated carious lesions (codes 3 to 6 on the Nyvad index) were found in 41.6% of the adolescents. Only 29.4% had a high level of OHL (BREALD-30 scores between 23 and 30); 42.3% of the families belonged to the A-B social class and 93% of the adolescents had been to the dentist at least once in their lifetimes. In the multivariate analysis, adolescents with inadequate (PR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.18-2.41; p = 0.004) and marginal (PR; 1.42; 95% CI: 1.01-1.99; p = 0.042) OHL and those in the lower social classes (C-D-E) (PR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.39-2.47; p<0.001) had more teeth with cavitated carious lesions. In conclusion, adolescents aged 15 to 19 years with poorer levels of OHL had a larger number of teeth with cavitated carious lesions, independently of their socioeconomic status and history of visiting a dentist.

AB Available literature identifies the need for a deeper understanding of the role of gender, age and socioeconomic status in children's exposure to violence and associations with mental health (MH) outcomes. The 1548 participants for this study were enrolled from 28 public charter schools and 9 community-based settings; youth were administered a screener that assessed exposure to traumatic events and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. Respondents reported extremely high levels of exposure to indirect violence: 41.7% witnessed shooting/stabbing/beating; 18.3% witnessed murder; and 53.8% experienced the murder of someone close. Frequency of adverse MH outcomes was high: 21.2% screened positive for depression; 45.7% for lifetime PTSD; and 26.9% for current PTSD. More males than females reported witnessing shooting/stabbing/beating (p =.04); females more often reported experiencing the murder of someone close (p =.001). Indirect violence exposure generally increased with age. Youth attending schools with >= 90% free/ reduced lunch participation (FRLP) showed significantly higher levels of violence exposure compared to youth in schools with <90% FRLP. Females endorsed significantly higher levels of depression (21.4% vs. 9.7%), and lifetime (53.9% vs. 34.9%) and current (32.5% vs. 19.6%) PTSD, compared with males (p <.0001, all comparisons). Female sex (aOR = 2.6), FRLP (aOR = 1.4 for >= 90% vs. <90%) and the number of different indirect violence exposures (aORs from 1.3 to 10.4), were significantly associated with a positive screen for any adverse MH outcome. Our data add important insights into gender heterogeneity of viewed violence, mental health symptoms, and their association-all of which are critical to guiding effective intervention efforts.

DE Dengue fever; Pregnant woman; Burkina Faso
AB Background: Dengue fever is prevalent in the world; in recent years, several outbreaks occurred in West Africa. It affects pregnant women. We aimed to assess the consequences of dengue fever on pregnant women and their fetuses during dengue epidemic in Burkina Faso.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study from November 1, 2015 to January 31, 2017 in 15 public and private health facilities in Ouagadougou, using secondary data. Immunochromatographic rapid test Duo detecting specific antibodies, immunoglobin M/G and /or dengue non structural antigen1 virus was used to diagnose dengue cases.
   Results: Out of 399 (48%) women registered during the study period, 25 (6%) were pregnant. The average age of pregnant women was 30 years, with 18 and 45 years as extremes. The main symptoms were fever (92%) and headache (92%). Nine patients (36%) had severe dengue characterized by bleeding (16%), neurological symptoms (16%) and acute respiratory distress (8%). Eight (32%) of the 25 women had early miscarriage and 8 (32%) women gave birth to viable fetuses. Among those with viable babies, 5 (20%) presented post-partum hemorrhage and 3 (12%) presented early delivery. The main fetal complications included 3 cases of acute fetal distress (12%). One case of maternal death (4%) and 4 cases of neonatal mortality (44.5%) were notified.
   Conclusion: Dengue fever occurring during pregnancy increases maternal and neonatal mortality. Its severe complications require specific monitoring of pregnant women until delivery.

TI Influence of anonymous HIV testing on national HIV surveillance in the
   Republic of Korea (2000 to 2015): a retrospective analysis
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE HIV prevalence; Anonymous test; Public health center; Korea
AB Background: Owing to the continuous increase in the number of new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in Korea, public health centers (PHCs) have performed anonymous tests since 1989. No study has examined the patterns of anonymous HIV testing performed at PHCs and the characteristics of HIV infection detected in those tests. We aimed to assess the influence of anonymous HIV testing on Korea's national HIV surveillance.
   Methods: HIV screening test data from 253 PHCs over a 16-year period were classified into 13 groups based on reason for testing. For anonymous HIV test takers (Anonymous), the HIV positivity per 10,000 tests was calculated, as repetitions could not be distinguished. Those with suspected HIV infection voluntarily underwent HIV testing and revealed their identity (Suspected). HIV prevalence was calculated as the number of HIV-positive persons per 10,000 test takers. Analyses were performed using chi-square and Cochran-Armitage trend test with SAS 9.4.
   Results: Approximately 400,000 HIV screening tests were performed at PHCs annually, which remained unchanged in the past 10 years. The proportion of anonymous testing increased from < 3.0% before 2014 to 4.8% in 2014 and 6.1% in 2015. While the number of HIV cases increased, the number of anonymous HIV-positive test results per 10,000 tests decreased from 68.8 in 2010 to 41.8 in 2015. The HIV prevalence among the suspected was approximately 20.0 per 10, 000 test takers before 2014, which steeply increased to 71.6 in 2015. Those with suspected HIV were predominantly men, aged 20 years, foreigners, and metropolitan city dwellers in the last 6 years. The high prevalence of persons with suspected HIV resulted in a doubling of HIV prevalence at PHCs between 2014 and 2015.
   Conclusions: Anonymous and Suspected, which were driven by similar motives, impacted each other. Increase in HIV prevalence among the suspected led to a higher HIV prevalence among all test takers in PHCs and higher proportions of HIV infection nationwide, which could be attributed to the increase in the number of anonymous tests performed in PHCs. HIV positivity among the anonymous and HIV prevalence among the suspected are key indexes of the national HIV surveillance in Korea.

ID IMPACT ASSESSMENT; PUBLIC-POLICY; INEQUALITIES; INTERVENTIONS; CARE
AB Background That there is a relationship between human rights and health is well established and frequently discussed. However, actions intended to take account of the relationship between human rights and social determinants of health have often been limited by lack of clarity and ambiguity concerning how these rights and determinants may interact and affect each other. It is difficult to know what to do when you do not understand how things work. As our own understanding of this consideration is founded on perspectives provided by the critical realist paradigm, we present an account of and commentary on our application of these perspectives in an investigation of this relationship. Findings We define the concept of paradigm and review critical realism and related implications for construction of knowledge concerning this relationship. Those implications include the need to theorise possible entities involved in the relationship together with their distinctive properties and consequential power to affect one another through exercise of their respective mechanisms (ways of working). This theorising work enabled us identify a complex, multi-layered assembly of entities involved in the relationship and some of the array of causal mechanisms that may be in play. These are presented in a summary framework. Conclusion Researchers' views about the nature of knowledge and its construction inevitably influence their research aims, approaches and outcomes. We demonstrate that by attending to these views, which are founded in their paradigm positioning, researchers can make more progress in understanding the relationship between human rights and the social determinants of health, in particular when engaged in theorizing work. The same approaches could be drawn on when other significant relationships in health environments are investigated.

AB Background Digital rectal examination (DRE) is one of the most common strategies for prostate cancer early detection. However, the use for screening purposes has a controversial benefit and potential harms can occur due to false-positive results, overdiagnosis and overtreatment. The objective of this study is to calculate the prevalence and identify factors associated with the receipt of DRE in Brazilian men. Methods We selected men older than 40 from a nationwide population-based survey (13,625 individuals) excluding those with prostate cancer diagnosis. Information was extracted from the most recent database of the Brazilian National Health Survey (PNS 2013). Statistical analysis was carried out to calculate incidence rate ratios, with 95% confidence intervals and p values, through multivariate analysis with Poisson regression and robust variance. Results Men having private health insurance (63.3%; CI = 60.5-66.0) presented higher prevalence of DRE than those in the public health system (41.6%; CI = 39.8-43.4). The results show a positive association between DRE and men having private health insurance, aged 60-69, living with a spouse, never smokers, and living in urban areas. Among public health services users, this positive association was observed among men aged 70-79, living with a spouse, having bad/very bad health self-perception, abstainers, ex-smokers, with undergraduate studies, presenting four or more comorbidities, and residing in urban areas. Conclusions Prostate cancer screening with DRE is quite frequent in Brazil, specially among men with private health plans and better access to health services, healthier lifestyle and at more advanced ages, characteristics which increase the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment.

The psychosocial interactive model of resilience theorises that resilience might be 'switched on' in order to support and/or maintain smoking cessation for these populations. This study aimed to develop a Resilience Intervention for Smoking Cessation (RISC) through reviewing the extant literature around efficacious interventions for smoking cessation. Deliberative democracy principles were then used to understand lay perspectives regarding this potential smoking cessation program. Methods Public health databases were searched to find efficacious psycho-social resilience interventions in the peer-reviewed literature for smoking cessation amongst lower SES populations. Potential components for RISC were selected based on evidence within the literature for their effectiveness. We then employed the Nominal Group Technique (NGT) to create discussion and consensus on the most socially appropriate and feasible components from the perspective of smokers from low SES areas. The NGT included 16 people from a lower SES population in southern metropolitan Adelaide who indicated they were seriously contemplating quitting smoking or had recently quit. Data were collected from multiple Likert ratings and rankings of the interventions during the NGT workshop and analysed descriptively. The Wilcoxon signed-ranked test was used where appropriate. Qualitative data were collected from participant reflections and group discussion, and analysed thematically. Results Six smoking cessation interventions, likely to enhance resilience, were selected as potential constituents for RISC: mindfulness training; setting realistic goals; support groups; smoke free environments; mobile phone apps; and motivational interviewing. Consensus indicated that mindfulness training and setting realistic goals were the most acceptable resilience enhancing interventions, based on perceived usefulness and feasibility. Conclusions This research applied principles from deliberative democracy in order to illuminate lay knowledge regarding an appropriate and acceptable smoking cessation resilience program for a lower SES population. This process of collaborative and complex knowledge-generation is critically important to confront inequities as an ongoing challenge in public health, such as smoking cessation for disadvantaged groups. Further research should involve development and trial of this resilience program.

AB Background Pregnancy crisis mismanagement has contributed to maternal deaths and illnesses globally and in Ghana due to absence/inadequate pregnancy options counselling for clients to make informed decisions. This study examines options counselling for abortion seekers in health facilities in Ghana. Methods Analytical cross-sectional study design was done in selected specialised public and NGO health facilities within Kumasi Metropolis of Ghana, using self-administered structured questionnaires for data collection from 1st January to 30th April, 2014. Participants were 442 women with unintended pregnancies seeking abortion services. Data was analysed using Epi-Info (7.1.1.14) and STATA 12 to generate descriptive statistics, Pearson chi-square and multivariable logistic regressions. The Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology approved the study. Results Respondents had divergent reproductive and socio-demographic profiles. Majority (about 58%) of them had been pregnant more than twice, but about 53% of this population had no biological children. (Although about 90% of respondents held perceptions that the index and previous pregnancies were mistimed/unintended, the majority (72%) had no induced abortion history. Induced abortion (208, 49%) and parenting (216, 51%) were mentioned as the only available options to unintended pregnancy in hospitals. Exposure to options counselling was observed to be significantly associated with parity (P = < 0.001), gestational age (P = < 0.001), previous induced abortions (P = < 0.001), perception of pregnancy at conception (P = < 0.001) and level of education (P = 0.002). The logistic regression analysis also shows that higher education has statistically significant effect on being exposed to options counselling (P = < 0.001). Majority of respondents (95%) were not aware that giving a child up for adoption is an option to abortion in Ghana. Conclusions Pregnancy options counselling remains a major challenge in comprehensive abortion care in Ghana. Although higher educational attainments significantly exposes women to options counselling for informed decisions, the less educated are disadvantaged in this regard. Further research on type and depth of counselling services provided to pregnant women in health facilities is required to inform health policy and program decisions.

DT Article
DE IPTp-SP uptake; Malaria prevention; Tanzania
AB Background Tanzania adopted the revised World Health Organization policy in 2013 recommending a minimum of >= 3 doses of Intermittent Preventive Treatment during pregnancy with Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) to protect against malaria. A study in Tanzania in 2014 reported low (9%) uptake. We investigated health workers knowledge about IPTp-SP and factors that influenced uptake of > 3 doses of IPTp-SP among pregnant women. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in 2017 among post-delivery women and health care workers from nine randomly-selected public health facilities in three Districts of Arusha Region. Probability proportional to size methodology was used to determine number of participants per facility. We used a structured questionnaire to collect socio-demographic and obstetric data, information on doses of SP received, and knowledge of SP for IPTp. Health care workers were interviewed about their knowledge for IPTp- SP and challenges encountered in its uptake and use. Results We interviewed 556 persons (median age 26 years, range 16-42 years) with the response rate of 99.3%. Of these, 484 (87.1%) had > 3 Antenatal Care (ANC) visits. A total of 402 (72.3%) were multigravida with 362 (65.1%) having given birth at least once. Of the 556 participants, 219 (39.4%) made their first ANC booking at < 17 weeks of pregnancy and 269 (48.4%) had received > 3 doses of SP-IPTp. Factors associated with uptake of > 3 doses of IPTp-SP included having secondary or higher education [Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) =1.6, 95%CI 1.1-2.4], attending >= 4 ANC visits [AOR = 3.1, 95%CI 2.1-4.6], having first antenatal booking at < 17 weeks [AOR = 1.8, 95%CI 1.4-2.3], and adequate knowledge on IPTp-SP [AOR = 2.7, 95%CI 1.9-3.9]. Among 36 health care workers interviewed, 29(80.6%) had adequate knowledge about IPTp-SP. SP was available in seven (87.5%) of the visited health facilities and was administered under Direct Observed Therapy (DOT) in six (75%) facilities. Health care workers reported that stock outs of SP was a challenge. Conclusions Fewer than half of the women interviewed reported uptake of > 3 doses of IPTp-SP. That is below the Tanzania national target of 80%. Making > 4 ANC visits, having secondary or higher education, making an early first ANC visit and having adequate knowledge on IPTp-SP promoted uptake of > 3 doses. Further qualitative studies are needed to explore factors that might contribute to low uptake of SP.

AB Background Brucellosis, caused by several Brucella species, such as the bacterium Brucella melitensis, is considered one of the most severe zoonotic diseases worldwide. Not only does it affect ruminant animal populations, leading to a substantial financial burden for stockbreeders, but also poses severe public health issues. For almost four decades in southern Europe and elsewhere, eradication of the disease has been based on ambiguously effective programs, rendering massive sanitation of livestock urgent and indispensable. Gene therapy, which has been proved effective in the clinic, could possibly constitute an alternative option towards a permanent cure for brucellosis, by aiding in the deletion or inactivation of genes associated with the replication of Brucella within the host cells. Results We infected ovine macrophages with B.melitensis, to simulate the host cell/microorganism interaction in vitro, and transduced the infected cells with CRISPR/Cas9 lentiviral vectors that target Brucella's RNA polymerase subunit A (RpolA) or virulence-associated gene virB10 at a multiplicity of infection of 60. We demonstrate a significant decrease in the bacterial load per cell when infected cells are transduced with the RpolA vector and that the number of internalized brucellae per cell remains unaffected when macrophages are transduced with a conventional lentiviral vector expressing the green fluorescence protein, thus underlining the bactericidal effect of our CRISPR/Cas9 system. Conclusions Pending in vivo verification of our findings, overall, these results may prove critical not only for the treatment of human brucellosis, but for other infectious diseases in general.

AB Background The prevalence of HIV among men who have sex with men (MSM) has become a significant public health challenge. The aim was to comprehensively estimate the national prevalence of HIV among MSM and its time trends through a large-scale systematic analysis. Methods Systematic search of Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang Data databases without language restriction for studies on the prevalence of HIV among MSM published before Dec.31, 2018. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were published in the peer-reviewed literature and used validated assessment methods to assess the prevalence of HIV among MSM. Estimates were pooled using random-effects analysis. Results Data were extracted from 355 cross-sectional studies (571,328 individuals) covered 59 cities from 30 provinces and municipalities of China. The overall national prevalence of HIV among MSM from 2001 to 2018 was estimated to be 5.7% (95% CI: 5.4-6.1%), with high between-study heterogeneity (I-2 = 98.0%, P < 0.001). Our study showed an increased tendency in the HIV prevalence as time progressed by meta-regression analysis (I-2 = 95.9%, P < 0.0001). HIV prevalence was the highest in those aged 50 years and older with HIV prevalence of 19.3% (95%CI: 13.1-27.4%, N = 13). HIV was more prevalent in the illiterate population (16.8%), than in those who had received an education. Although the internet was a major venue for Chinese MSM seeking male sex partners (35.6, 95%CI: 32.3-39.9%, N = 101), seeking MSM in bathhouses/saunas had the highest associated prevalence of HIV (13.4, 95%CI: 10.3-17.1%, N = 22). The HIV prevalence among MSM varied by location: compared with other regions in China, HIV was highly prevalent among MSM in the southwest (10.7, 95%CI: 9.3-12.2%, N = 91). Compared to participants who sometimes or always used condoms, participants who had never used a condom in the past 6 months had a higher risk of HIV infection, with odds ratios of 0.1 (95%CI: 0.08-0.14). Conclusions Our analysis provided reliable estimates of China's HIV burden among MSM, which appears to present an increasing national public health challenge. Effective government responses are needed to address this challenge and include the implementation of HIV prevention.

AB Background Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a widespread mosquito-borne virus representing a serious challenge to public health. The largest outbreak in the Middle-East was recorded in 2016-2017 in Pakistan. Sistan and Baluchistan Province of Iran shares a wide border with Pakistan; accordingly, introduction of CHIKV from Pakistan to Iran seems to be probable. The current study is aimed at investigating CHIKV infection in Sistan and Baluchistan Province. Methods Between April 2017 and June 2018, a total of 159 serum samples of CHIK suspected cases from 10 cities of Sistan and Baluchistan Province were tested by molecular and serological assays. Samples obtained up to 4 days after onset of illness were tested by real time PCR (n = 8). Samples collected 5-10 days after disease onset were subjected to ELISA, as well as real time PCR tests (n = 72). Samples obtained after the 10th day of disease onset were tested by only ELISA (n = 79). Phylogenetic analysis of real time PCR positive samples was carried out by sequencing of a 1014-bp region of Envelope 1 gene (E1 gene). Chi-square and independent t tests were used to evaluate the association between variables and CHIKV infection. Results In total, 40 (25.1%) out of 159 samples tested positive either by real time PCR or ELISA tests.Out of 151 samples serologically analyzed, 19 (12.6%) and 28 (18.6%) cases were positive for anti-CHIKV IgM and anti-CHIKV IgG antibodies, respectively. Of 80 samples tested by real time PCR, CHIKV RNA was detected in 11 (13.7%) sera, all of them had recent travel history to Pakistan. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis of 5 samples indicated their similarity with recent isolates of Pakistan outbreak 2016-2017 belonging to Indian Ocean sub-lineage of ECSA genotype. A significant correlation between abroad travel history and CHIKV infection was observed (P < 0.001). The most common clinical symptoms included fever, arthralgia/arthritis, myalgia, headache, and chill. Conclusions These results present substantial evidence of CHIKV introduction to Iran from Pakistan and emphasize the need for the enhancement of surveillance system and preventive measures.

AB BackgroundAlthough long-term alcohol and tobacco use have widely been recognised as important risk factors for cancer, the impacts of alcohol and tobacco health policies on cancer mortality have not been examined in previous studies. This study aims to estimate the association of key alcohol and tobacco policy or events in Australia with changes in overall and five specific types of cancer mortality between the 1950s and 2013.MethodsAnnual population-based time-series data between 1911 and 2013 on per capita alcohol and tobacco consumption and head and neck (lip, oral cavity, pharynx, larynx and oesophagus), lung, breast, colorectum and anus, liver and total cancer mortality data from the 1950s to 2013 were collected from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and Cancer Council Victoria, the WHO Cancer Mortality Database and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. The policies with significant relations to changes in alcohol and tobacco consumption were identified in an initial model. Intervention dummies with estimated lags were then developed based on these key alcohol and tobacco policies and events and inserted into time-series models to estimate the relation of the particular policy changes with cancer mortality.ResultsLiquor licence liberalisation in the 1960s was significantly associated with increases in the level of population drinking and thereafter of male cancer mortality. The introduction of random breath testing programs in Australia after 1976 was associated with a reduction in population drinking and thereafter in cancer mortality for both men and women. Meanwhile, the release of UK and US public health reports on tobacco in 1962 and 1964 and the ban on cigarette ads on TV and radio in 1976 were found to have been associated with a reduction in Australian tobacco consumption and thereafter a reduction in mortality from all cancer types except liver cancer. Policy changes on alcohol and tobacco during the 1960s-1980s were associated with greater changes for men than for women, particularly for head and neck, lung and colorectum cancer sites.ConclusionThis study provides evidence that some changes to public health policies in Australia in the twentieth century were related to the changes in the population consumption of alcohol and tobacco, and in subsequent mortality from various cancers over the following 20years.

AB Background
   Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious public health problem and a global concern. The inappropriate use of antibiotics has been identified by the World Health Organization as a major risk factor for AMR.
   Methods
   The purpose of this research study is to assess the prevalence of inappropriate antibiotic use among Qatar University students and their family members, detect sociodemographic factors associated with inappropriate use, evaluate the knowledge and attitude towards antibiotic use, and assess respondents' opinions on healthcare providers' antibiotic prescription practices. Participants (N = 596) completed a self-administered questionnaire. Descriptive analysis, the Pearson chi-squared test, and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed.
   Results
   The major inappropriate antibiotic use practices followed by the respondents were using antibiotics without prescription (82%), not completing the antibiotic course (45%), and obtaining antibiotics from the pharmacy without prescription (23%). The chi-square test results showed that age (p = 0.031) and nationality (p = 0.041) were associated with using antibiotics without prescription. In addition, respondents less than 21 years of age (p< 0.001), who had only a secondary education (p = 0.007), and who lived in one of the large and crowded cities in Qatar (p = 0.011) had higher odds of stopping the antibiotic before completing the course. Our study also revealed that almost 60% of the respondents had inadequate knowledge and a negative attitude towards antibiotic use. Nationality and municipality were the independent factors associated with having appropriate knowledge of antibiotic use. Univariate logistic regression analyses in our study demonstrated that older (> 26 years), married and university-graduated participants were more likely to have a positive attitude towards antibiotic use than others. Respondents also reported that neither doctors nor pharmacists were providing adequate patient education about appropriate antibiotic use. The Socio-Ecological Model was applied to interpret the findings and frame implications.
   Conclusion
   The findings shed light on various factors shaping antibiotic use practices and provide evidence to design multilevel behavioral interventions to improve public practices of antibiotic use.

AB Increasing prevalence of sedentary behavior (SB) combined with low levels of physical activity (PA) in children and adolescents has become a growing public health concern. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the daily behavioral pattern of adolescents and examine the isotemporal substitution effects of SB with light-intensity PA (LIPA) or moderate-tovigorous PA (MVPA) on cardiometabolic markers. In this cross-sectional study, the daily behavioral pattern of Brazilian male adolescents was objectively measured for 7 days. Vector magnitude activity counts were used to estimate SB, LIPA, and MVPA with cut-points specifically validated for youth. The isotemporal substitution model was used to assess the effects of replacing different SB bouts (5, 10, 30, and 60 min) with LIPA or MVPA on cardiometabolic markers [body mass index, waist circumference, body fat percentage (BF%), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), non-HDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), glucose, insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR), insulin sensitivity (HOMA2-S), beta cell function (HOMA2-beta), systolic-blood pressure (SBP), diastolic-blood pressure, and cardiometabolic risk score]. Male adolescents (n = 84; age, 16.7 +/- 0.9 years) wore the GT3X+ for 6.7 +/- 0.6 days, during 15.2 +/- 2.3 h, and spent 72.9% of the time in SB, 17.3% in LIPA, and 9.8% in MVPA. SB replacement with LIPA was associated with increased HDL-C, TG, HOMA2-IR, and HOMA2-S and decreased SBP. In contrast, SB replacement with MVPA was associated with decreased BF%. Therefore, our findings suggest that replacing SB with LIPA showed positive results on HDL-C, HOMA2-S and SBP, while replacing SB with MVPA was associated with only one obesity indicator (BF%). Moreover, participants met the daily MVPA recommendations, but they still had a daily behavioral pattern with high SB. In this context, LIPAs can be considered an effective alternative to reduce SB and improve the health indicators of this population.

TI Determinants of effective organisational capacity training: lessons from
   a training programme on health workforce development with participants
   from three African countries
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH

AB Background: Health systems in sub-Saharan Africa face multifaceted capacity challenges to fulfil their mandates of service provision and governance of their resources. Four academic institutions in Africa implemented a World Health Organisation-funded collaborative project encompassing training, curriculum development, and partnership to strengthen national leadership and training capacity for health workforce development. This paper looks into the training component of the project, a blended Masters programme in public health that sought to improve the capacity of personnel involved in teaching or management/development of human resources for health. The paper aims to explore factors influencing contribution of training to organisational capacity development.
   Methods: We chose a case study design. Semi-structured interviews were held with 18 trainees that were enrolled in the training programme, and who were affiliated to health ministries or public health training institutions. We gathered additional data through document reviews, observation, and interviews with 14 key informants associated with the programme and/or working in the collaborating institutions. The evidence gathered were analysed thematically.
   Results: Thirteen of the 18 training participants stayed in the target institutions and contributed to improved capacity of their institutions in the fields of management, policy, planning, research, training, or curriculum development. Five left for private and international agencies due to dissatisfaction with payment, work conditions, or career prospect. Factors that were associated with the training, trainees, and the institutional and broader context, determine contribution of training to organisational capacity development. These include relevance of newly acquired knowledge and skills set of trainees to the role/position they assume in the organisation; recognition of trainees by employing organisations in terms of promotion or assignment of challenging tasks; and motivation and retention of trained staff.
   Conclusion: Training, even if relevant and applicable, makes no more than a 'latent' contribution, one which is activated and realised through alignment of clusters of interacting contextual and relational factors related to the target institutions and trained personnel. While not predictable, implementers need to focus more deliberately on the likely interaction and best possible alignments between training relevance, student selection for potential to contribute, recognition and career advancement potential.

AB Background: Childhood obesity is a growing public health concern in many low-income urban settings; but its determinants are not clear. The purpose of this study is to assess the prevalence of childhood obesity and associated factors among in-school children aged 5-16 years in a Metropolitan district of Ghana.
   Methods: A cross-sectional quantitative survey was conducted among a sample of 285 in-school children aged 516 years. Pre-tested questionnaires and anthropometric data collection methods were used to collect data. Descriptive, bivariate, binary and multivariate logistic regression statistical techniques were used to analyse data.
   Results: Some 46.9% (42.2% for males and 51.7% for females) of the children were overweight. Of this, 21.2% were obese (BMI falls above 95th percentile). Childhood obesity was higher in private school (26.8%) than public school (21.4%), and among girls (27.2%) than boys (19%). Factors that increased obesity risks included being aged 11-16 as against 5-10 years (aOR = 6.07; 95%CI = 1.17-31.45; p = 0.025), having a father whose highest education is 'secondary' (aOR =2.97; 95% CI = 1.09-8.08; p = 0.032), or 'tertiary' (aOR = 3.46; 95% CI = 1.27-9.42; p = 0.015), and consumption of fizzy drinks most days of the week (aOR = 2.84; 95% CI = 1.24-6.52; p = 0.014). Factors that lowered obesity risks included engaging in sport at least 3times per week (aOR = 0.56; 95% CI = 0.33-0.96; p = 0.034), and sleeping for more than 8 h per day (aOR = 0.38; 95% CI = 0.19-0.79; p = 0.009).
   Conclusion: Higher parental (father) educational attainment and frequent consumption of fizzy drinks per week may increase obesity risks among in-school children aged 5-16 years in the Metropolitan district of Ghana. However, regular exercise (playing sport at least 3 times per week) and having 8 or more hours of sleep per day could lower obesity risks in the same population. Age and sex-appropriate community and school-based interventions are needed to promote healthy diet selection and consumption, physical activity and healthy life styles among in-school children.

AB Background: The development of antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to global public health. Inappropriate use of antibiotics is recognised as a leading cause of antibiotic resistance. The aim of this study was to explore the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards antibiotic use among adults in Nepal.
   Methods: A quantitative survey was conducted with 220 community members of the Rupandehi district of Nepal, with cluster sampling techniques applied to select households. Interviews were carried out face-to-face using a structured questionnaire. Responses were presented using descriptive analysis, with chi-squared tests and regression analysis applied to identify factors associated with KAP about antibiotic use and the Spearman's rank order correlation coefficient calculated to examine the relationship between responses to the KAP questions.
   Results: The sample comprised more females (54%) than males, the average age of respondents was 38.5 years and almost 60% of respondents lived in rural areas. Respondents had relatively good knowledge about aspects of antibiotic use other than identifying antibiotics. The concept of antibiotic resistance was well known but imperfectly understood. Half of respondents (50.9%) were unsure whether skipping doses would contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance, 88.2% indicated they would go to another doctor if not prescribed an antibiotic when they thought one was needed and nearly half (47.7%) believed antibiotics helped them get better more quickly if they had a fever. Most respondents reported correct practices accessing and using antibiotics, however, 84.6% at least sometimes preferred an antibiotic when they have a cough and sore throat. Logistic regression showed respondents with higher levels of education tended to have better knowledge, more appropriate attitudes and better practices about antibiotic use. Rural respondents were less likely to have better knowledge about antibiotic use, while females were more likely to report better practices.
   Conclusion: The study provides baseline evidence about the knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding antibiotic use among the population of the Rupandehl district. Its findings will be useful in designing effective and targeted interventions to decrease misconceptions about antibiotic use and to increase awareness about the risks of inappropriate use of antibiotics in the community.

AB BackgroundKnowledge construction is a form of communication in which people can work individually or collaboratively. Peer support services have been adopted by the public psychiatric and social welfare service as a regular form of intervention since 2015 in Hong Kong. Peer-based services can help people with bipolar disorder (BD) deal with the implications of the diagnosis, the way in which individuals with BD receive treatment, and the lifestyle changes that take place as a result of the diagnosis. Through a qualitative paradigm, this study aims to examine how individuals with BD use technical and expert-by-experience knowledge.MethodsA total of 32 clients of mental health services were recruited from hospitals, Integrated Community Centers for Mental Wellness, and non-governmental organizations. They participated in semi-structured individual interviews. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis with the aid of NVivo. The findings were verified by peer researchers.ResultsThree main themes are presented in this article, including how clients made sense of the knowledge provided by mental health professionals and peer support workers (PSWs), critical perspectives about peer support services, and the way in which the services are more than knowledge transfer alone. Participants generally indicated that knowledge sharing revolved around three experiences: mood changes, medications, and sense of hope. Nevertheless, an empathic understanding of the clients' experience was more important than the sharing of knowledge. Some clients perceived medication as the chief means to recovery, so PSWs were not useful for them. However, PSW role models had an effect beyond mere knowledge transmission, as they could promote clients' pursuit of functional recovery goals.ConclusionsThe present study has improved our understanding of knowledge sharing between clients with BD and health professionals or PSWs, which should take place in an empathic and hope-instilling manner. It has also emphasized the value of the presence of a role model who can speak convincingly with clients to facilitate recovery. The present findings can be used to improve the care of people with BD by generating important guidance with regard to enhancing the knowledge exchange between clients and health practitioners.

AB Background
   Lifestyle change can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes among women with prior gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). While understanding women's lived experiences and views around GDM is critical to the development of behaviour change interventions to reduce this risk, few studies have addressed this issue in low- and middle- income countries. The aim of the study was to explore women's lived experiences of GDM and the feasibility of sustained lifestyle modification after GDM in a low-income setting.
   Methods
   This was a descriptive qualitative study on the lived experiences of women with prior GDM, who received antenatal care at a public sector tertiary hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. Nine focus groups and five in-depth interviews were conducted with a total of thirty-five women. Data were analysed using content analysis and the COM-B (Capabilities, Opportunities, Motivations and Behaviour) model to identify factors influencing lifestyle change during and beyond the GDM pregnancy.
   Results
   The results suggest that the COM-B model's concepts of capability (knowledge and skills for behaviour change), opportunity (resources for dietary change and physical activity) and motivation (perception of future diabetes risk) are relevant to lifestyle change among GDM women in South Africa. The results will contribute to the design of a postpartum health system intervention for women with recent GDM.
   Conclusion
   Our findings highlight the need for health services to improve counselling and education for women with GDM in South Africa. Support from family and health professionals is essential for women to achieve lifestyle change. The experience of GDM imposed a significant psychological burden on women, which affected motivation for lifestyle change. To achieve long-term lifestyle change, behaviour interventions for women with prior GDM need to address their capability, opportunity and motivation for lifestyle change during and beyond pregnancy.

AB Background Influenza is an infectious respiratory disease that can cause serious public health hazard. Due to its huge threat to the society, precise real-time forecasting of influenza outbreaks is of great value to our public. Results In this paper, we propose a new deep neural network structure that forecasts a real-time influenza-like illness rate (ILI%) in Guangzhou, China. Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks is applied to precisely forecast accurateness due to the long-term attribute and diversity of influenza epidemic data. We devise a multi-channel LSTM neural network that can draw multiple information from different types of inputs. We also add attention mechanism to improve forecasting accuracy. By using this structure, we are able to deal with relationships between multiple inputs more appropriately. Our model fully consider the information in the data set, targetedly solving practical problems of the Guangzhou influenza epidemic forecasting. Conclusion We assess the performance of our model by comparing it with different neural network structures and other state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results indicate that our model has strong competitiveness and can provide effective real-time influenza epidemic forecasting.

TI Quality of Kangaroo Mother Care services in Ethiopia: Implications for
   policy and practice
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID BARRIERS; PRETERM
AB Background
   Providing high-quality kangaroo mother care (KMC) is a strategy proven to improve outcomes in premature babies. However, whether KMC is consistently and appropriately provided in Ethiopia is unclear. This study assesses the quality of KMC services in Ethiopia and the factors associated with its appropriate initiation among low birth weight neonates.
   Methods
   We used data from the 2016 national Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (EmONC) assessment which contains data on all health facilities providing delivery care services in Ethiopia (N = 3,804). We described the quality of KMC services provided to low-birth weight (LBW) babies in terms of infrastructure, processes and outcomes (survival status at discharge). We also explored the factors associated with appropriate KMC initiation using multivariable logistic regression models.
   Results
   The quality of KMC services in Ethiopia was poor. The facilities included scored only 59.0% on average on a basic index of service readiness. KMC was initiated for only 46.4% of all LBW babies included in the sample. Among those who received KMC, 66.7% survived, 13.3% died and 20.4% had no data on survival status at discharge. LBW babies born in health centers were twice more likely to receive KMC compared to those born in hospitals (AOR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.3-3.0). Public facilities, those with a staff rotation policy in place for newborn care, and those with separate newborn corners were also more likely to initiate KMC for LBW babies.
   Conclusions
   We found low levels of appropriate KMC initiation, inadequate infrastructure and staffing, and poor survival among LBW babies in Ethiopia. Efforts must be made to improve the adoption of this life saving technique, particularly in hospitals and in the private sector where KMC remains underutilized. Facilities should also dedicate specific spaces for newborn care that enables mothers to provide KMC. In addition, improving record keeping and data quality for routine health data is a priority.

TI Prevalence and risk factors for multi-drug resistant Escherichia coli
   among poultry workers in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, Nigeria
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID EXTENDED-SPECTRUM; ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE; PLASMIDS
AB Background
   Antimicrobial resistance has emerged as a global health threat. Antimicrobial resistant Escherichia coli infections are associated with high morbidity and expenditure when compared with infections caused by susceptible strains. In Nigeria, antimicrobial drugs are readily available over-the-counter with potential for indiscriminate use by poultry farmers and eventual development of drug resistance. The objective of this study was to investigate prevalence and risk factors for multi-drug resistant E. coli among poultry workers (PW) in Abuja, Nigeria.
   Materials and methods
   A cross-sectional study was conducted among 122 randomly selected apparently healthy poultry workers (poultry-farmers/ sellers) in Municipal and Kuje Area Councils from December 2018 to April 2019. Data was collected on socio-demographics and exposure factors using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. E. coli was isolated and identified from stool samples of poultry workers. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was done using KirbyBauer disk diffusion method. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was defined as resistance to three or more classes of antimicrobials. Data was analyzed by computing proportions, prevalence odds-ratios (POR) and logistic regression at 5% significance level.
   Results
   Among PW, there were 121 males (99.2%). Mean age of the male workers was 30.6 +/- 9.7years, 54.6% (n = 66) married, 57.9% (n = 70) had secondary education and 62.0% (n = 75) were farm-workers. Prevalence of E. coli was 39.7% (n = 48), highest among farm-workers (POR = 2.7, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 1.3-5.7; p = 0.01) compared to poultrysellers. Of the 48 E. coli isolates, 16.7% (n = 8) were extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) producers and 79.2% (n = 38) were MDR. We detected resistance against Tetracycline: (83.3%, n = 40), Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim: (79.2%, n = 38), Ampicillin: (77.1%, n = 37), Streptomycin: (72.9%, n = 35), Nalidixic acid: (50%, n = 24), Gentamicin: (41.7%, n = 20), Chloramphenicol: (31.3%, n = 15), Cephalothin: (27.1%, n = 13), Nitrofurantoin: (10.4%, n = 5) and Imipenem: (6.3%, n = 3). Absence of lavatory (POR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.16.7); existence of farm/market for >10years (POR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.1-5.4) and PW's history of diarrhea in last three months (POR = 2.8, CI = 1.2-6.3) were associated with MDR. Controlling for age, absence of lavatory (adjusted OR [aOR] = 4.31, 95% CI = 1.6-11.9); PW's history of diarrhea in last three months (aOR = 3.3,95%CI = 1.3-8.5) and work exposure >10years (aOR = 0.3, 95%CI = 0.1-0.9) remained independent risk factors for MDR.
   Conclusion
   Prevalence of resistant E. coli was highest among farm-workers and associated with older farms/markets, occupational exposure of over 10 years and poor hygienic measures. The management of Municipal and Kuje Area Councils were recommended to provide lavatories for public use in farm-settlements/markets. The importance of hand-hygiene and responsible use of antimicrobials in poultry production was emphasized.

TI Structural vulnerability to narcotics-driven firearm violence: An
   ethnographic and epidemiological study of Philadelphia's Puerto Rican
   inner-city
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MIXED METHODS RESEARCH; HEALTH; COMMUNITY
AB Background
   The United States is experiencing a continuing crisis of gun violence, and economically marginalized and racially segregated inner-city areas are among the most affected. To decrease this violence, public health interventions must engage with the complex social factors and structural drivers-especially with regard to the clandestine sale of narcotics-that have turned the neighborhood streets of specific vulnerable subgroups into concrete killing fields. Here we present a mixed-methods ethnographic and epidemiological assessment of narcotics-driven firearm violence in Philadelphia's impoverished, majority Puerto Rican neighborhoods.
   Methods
   Using an exploratory sequential study design, we formulated hypotheses about ethnic/racial vulnerability to violence, based on half a dozen years of intensive participant-observation ethnographic fieldwork. We subsequently tested them statistically, by combining geo-referenced incidents of narcotics-and firearm-related crime from the Philadelphia police department with census information representing race and poverty levels. We explored the racialized relationships between poverty, narcotics, and violence, melding ethnography, graphing, and Poisson regression.
   Findings
   Even controlling for poverty levels, impoverished majority-Puerto Rican areas in Philadelphia are exposed to significantly higher levels of gun violence than majority-white or black neighborhoods. Our mixed methods data suggest that this reflects the unique social position of these neighborhoods as a racial meeting ground in deeply segregated Philadelphia, which has converted them into a retail endpoint for the sale of astronomical levels of narcotics.
   Implications
   We document racial/ethnic and economic disparities in exposure to firearm violence and contextualize them ethnographically in the lived experience of community members. The exceptionally concentrated and high-volume retail narcotics trade, and the violence it generates in Philadelphia's poor Puerto Rican neighborhoods, reflect unique structural vulnerability and cultural factors. For most young people in these areas, the narcotics economy is the most readily accessible form of employment and social mobility. The performance of violence is an implicit part of survival in these lucrative, illegal narcotics markets, as well as in the overcrowded jails and prisons through which entry-level sellers cycle chronically. To address the structural drivers of violence, an inner-city Marshall Plan is needed that should include well-funded formal employment programs, gun control, re-training police officers to curb the routinization of brutality, reform of criminal justice to prioritize rehabilitation over punishment, and decriminalization of narcotics possession and low-level sales.

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; LOW-INCOME; PREVALENCE
AB Background
   Anemia during pregnancy is a common public health problem globally and it defined as the hemoglobin concentration of less than 11 g/dl. Anemia during pregnancy has maternal and perinatal diverse consequences and it increase the risk of maternal and perinatal mortality. The aim of this study is to assess magnitude and factors associated with anemia among pregnant women attending antenatal care in Bench Maji, Keffa and Sheka zones of public hospitals, South west, Ethiopia, 2018.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional study was employed on 1871 pregnant mothers from selected hospitals. All third trimester pregnant women attending antenatal care at Mizan-Tepi University Teaching Hospital, Tepi, Gebretsadik Shawo and Wacha public hospitals were included in the study. Data was entered to Epidata version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 21 for analysis. Logistic regression analysis was carried out to identify independently associate factors at confidence interval of 95% and significance level of P-value <0.05.
   Result
   The magnitude of anemia in this study from the total study participant was 356 (19.0%). Among anemic pregnant women, 330 (92.7%), 21(5.9%) and 5(1.4%) were mild anemia, moderate anemia and severe anemia respectively. Age group 20-24 [AOR 6.28(2.40-16.42)], 25-29 [AOR = 6.38 (2.71-15.01)], 30-34 [AOR = 5.13 (2.27-11.58) and age >= 35 years [AOR = 2.53 (1.07-5.98)], educational status (read and write) [AOR 2.06, 95% CI (1.12-3.80)], gestational age(term)[AOR 1.94, 95% CI (1.27-2.96)], Caffeine (coffee and tea) and alcohol use occasionally [AOR 2.01, 95% CI (1.14-3.55)] and [AOR 2.59, 95% CI (1.49-4.52)] respectively, nutritional status (under nutrition) [AOR 3.00, 95% CI (2.22-3.97)] and family size (>6) [AOR 2.66, 95% CI (1.49-4.77)] were factors associated with anemia.
   Conclusion
   The magnitude of anemia found to be high. Age, educational status of the mother, gestational age, caffeine and alcohol use, Nutritional status and family size were factors significantly associated with anemia. To prevent adverse outcome of anemia, health care providers should work on these factors.

Twenty in-depth interviews with the mothers of the children suffering from moderate to severe malnutrition and several other interviews were conducted with the key stakeholders like anganwadi workers, Integrated Child Development Scheme supervisors, Accredited Social Health Activists, public distribution system shopkeeper and registered medical practitioners. Interviews with the key informants were conducted in the Balagahat district of Madhya Pradesh. Key factors responsible for perpetuating malnutrition were then identified through thematic analysis. It was found that dissatisfaction with public services and indifferent attitude of public servants resulting in poor uptake of public services further accentuated the problem. A qualitative enquiry into the issue of high and persistent levels of malnourishment among these tribal children revealed several aspects which quantitative method may not have captured. This implies that while framing a policy for improvement in the nutrition status in such population, a holistic approach is required instead of focussing on one aspect such as supplementation of nutrition alone.

TI Regional, racial, gender, and tumor biology disparities in breast cancer
   survival rates in Africa: A systematic review and meta-analysis

AB Background
   The survival rates from breast cancer in Africa are poor and yet the incidence rates are on the rise. In this study, we hypothesized that, in Africa, a continent with great disparities in socio-economic status, race, tumor biology, and cultural characteristics, the survival rates from breast cancer vary greatly based on region, tumor biology (hormone receptor), gender, and race. We aimed to conduct the first comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis on region, gender, tumor-biology and race-specific 5-year breast cancer survival rates in Africa and compared them to 20-year survival trends in the United States.
   Methods
   We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library to identify studies on breast cancer survival in African published before October 17, 2018. Pooled 5-year survival rates of breast cancer were estimated by random-effects models. We explored sources of heterogeneity through subgroup meta-analyses and meta-regression. Results were reported as absolute difference (AD) in percentages. We compared the survival rates of breast cancer in Africa and the United States.
   Findings
   There were 54 studies included, consisting of 18,970 breast cancer cases. There was substantial heterogeneity in the survival rates (mean 52.9%, range 7-91%, I-2 = 99.1%; p for heterogeneity < 0.0001). Meta-regression analyses suggested that age and gender-adjusted 5-year survival rates were lower in sub-Saharan Africa compared to north Africa (AD:-25.4%; 95% CI:-34.9-15.82%), and in predominantly black populations compared to predominantly non-black populations (AD:-25.9%; 95% CI: 35.40-16.43%). Survival rates were 10 percentage points higher in the female population compared to male, but the difference was not significant. Progesterone and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer subtypes were positively associated with survival (r = 0.39, p = 0.08 and r = 0.24, p = 0.29 respectively), but triple-negative breast cancer was negatively associated with survival. Survival rates are increasing over time more in non-black Africans (55% in 2000 versus 65% in 2018) compared to black Africans (33% in 2000 versus 40% in 2018); but, the survival rates for Africans are still significantly lower when compared to black (76% in 2015) and white (90% in 2015) populations in the United States.
   Conclusion
   Regional, sub-regional, gender, and racial disparities exist, influencing the survival rates of breast cancer in Africa. Therefore, region and race-specific public health interventions coupled with prospective genetic studies are urgently needed to improve breast cancer survival in this region.

TI The fight against polio through the NO-DO newsreels during the Francoism
   period in Spain
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID POLIOMYELITIS
AB The weekly NO-DO newsreels, official and of obligatory projection in cinemas, held an information monopoly during the Francoist dictatorship (1943-1975) in Spain. The NO-DO was used as an instrument of indoctrination and legitimation, building a discourse based on the regime's needs and interests. In this study, we examined newsreels on medical subjects related to vaccine-preventable diseases. A majority of reports centred on poliomyelitis, and two differentiated periods could be defined, coinciding with the evolution of the Franco regime's foreign policy. The first period reflected the regime's era of isolation and referred to polio as a foreign disease, with the NO-DO showing the US initiatives to fight against it, as it had become the scientific model to follow. Subsequently, the ambiguities of the news related to the disease reflected the dictatorship's refusal to confront the epidemic suffered by the Spanish population until the vaccination campaigns began in 1963. Even then, the consequences that the negligent management of the disease had for many families were concealed. Meanwhile, the image of a modernized country concerned about national public health was legitimized.

AB Background
   Maternal physical and mental health during pregnancy are key determinants of birth outcomes. There are relatively few prospective data that integrate physical and mental maternal health measures with birth outcomes in low- and middle-income country settings. We aimed to investigate maternal health during pregnancy and the impact on birth outcomes in an African birth cohort study, the Drakenstein Child Health Study.
   Methods
   Pregnant women attending 2 public health clinics, Mbekweni (serving a predominantly black African population) and TC Newman (predominantly mixed ancestry) in a poor peri-urban area of South Africa were enrolled in their second trimester and followed through childbirth. All births occurred at a single public hospital. Maternal sociodemographic, physical and psychosocial characteristics were comprehensively assessed. Multivariable linear regression models were used to explore associations between maternal health and birth outcomes.
   Results
   Over 3 years, 1137 women (median age 25.8 years; 21% HIV-infected) gave birth to 1143 live babies. Most pregnancies were uncomplicated but gestational diabetes (1%), anaemia (22%) or pre-eclampsia (2%) occurred in a minority. Most households (87%) had a monthly income of less than USD 350; only 27% of moms were employed and food insecurity was common (37%). Most babies (80%) were born by vaginal delivery at full term; 17% were preterm, predominantly late preterm. Only 74 (7%) of babies required hospitalisation immediately after birth and only 2 babies were HIV-infected. Food insecurity, socioeconomic status, pregnancy-associated hypertension, pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes and mixed ancestry were associated with lower infant gestational age while maternal BMI at enrolment was associated with higher infant gestational age. Primigravida or alcohol use during pregnancy were negatively associated with infant birth weight and head circumference. Maternal BMI at enrolment was positively associated with birth weight and gestational diabetes was positively associated with birth weight and head circumference for gestational age. Smoking during pregnancy was associated with lower infant birth weight.
   Conclusion
   Several modifiable risk factors including food insecurity, smoking, and alcohol consumption during pregnancy were identified as associated with negative birth outcomes, all of which are amenable to public health interventions. Interventions to address key exposures influencing birth outcomes are needed to improve maternal and child health in low-middle income country settings.

ID INNOVATION; COVERAGE; EQUITY; POOR
AB Background: The Urban Primary Health Care Project (UPHCP) was implemented by the Government of Bangladesh in response to rapid urbanization and growing inequalities in access to and quality of primary health care. The goal of the project was to improve health status of the urban poor living in city corporations and municipalities through the provision of health care services by NGOs that are contracted through public-private partnership. The first phase of the project started in 1998 and the project is currently in its fourth phase covering more urban areas than the first three phases. This study evaluates the impact of the second phase project (UPHCP-II) on health outcomes, mainly child diarrhea, acute respiratory infection, antenatal and postnatal care, skilled birth attendance, breastfeeding prevalence, contraceptive prevalence, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV/AIDS awareness.
   Methods: The effect of the project was estimated through propensity score matching between project and non-project areas comparing baseline and endline surveys over a six-year period from 2006 to 2012. An innovation of this study is the recalibration of the sampling weights that allows the use of these two independent surveys in impact evaluation.
   Results: Over the six-year period, UPHCP-II improved the health status of the population in project areas compared to non-project areas. The study found significant improvement in health outcomes in terms of reduced diarrhea and acute respiratory infection in children, which explains the downward trend in child mortality rate. Moreover, the project also improved antenatal care and skilled birth attendance. Contraceptive prevalence and HIV/AIDS awareness and avoidance increased, and sexually transmitted infections decreased.
   Conclusions: UPHCP-II was effective in achieving its health outcome targets, while previous studies show that it was efficient in the delivery of health care and clients were highly satisfied because health facilities were in close proximity, and doctors and staff were perceived as responsive in delivering high quality of care. The results of this study could help inform future design and implementation of urban health interventions that involve contracting primary health care service delivery in Bangladesh and other similar settings.

DT Article
DE Patient satisfaction; Private wing; Regular services; OPD; Addis Ababa;
   Ethiopia
AB Background: Knowing the factors for patient satisfaction is an important and direct indicator of quality of health care which is essential for providers to fill their gaps. Although few studies have been conducted on patient satisfaction in Ethiopia; but there is limited evidence for comparing patient satisfaction and associated factors in the public and private wing of the health services. Thus, this study aimed to investigate factors of patient satisfaction in adult outpatient departments in the private wing and regular services at public hospitals of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
   Methods: A comparative institution based cross-sectional study was conducted from March to April 2018. A total of 955 systematically selected patients were interviewed by using an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis p value < 0.05 and adjusted odd ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to identify the associated factors.
   Results: The overall patient satisfaction was 89.3% (95% CI: 87.2-91.2). At the regular and private wings of outpatient departments it was 88.3% (95% CI: 85.4-91.2) and 90.4% (95% CI: 87.6-93), respectively. At regular service OPD, patient satisfaction was affected by female sex (AOR: 7.78; 95% CI: 2.89-20.93), long waiting time (AOR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.07-0.73), information on the prevention of recurrent illnesses (AOR: 14.16; 95% CI: 4.58-43.83), and information on drug use and side effects (AOR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.08-0.63). In private wing, it was affected by being in the age group of 38 to 47 years (AOR: 22.1; 95% CI: 2.39-203.6), attended elementary school (AOR: 4.69; 95% CI: 1.04-21.26), availability of drugs (AOR: 0.14; 95% CI: 0.04-0.58), and the accessibility of latrines (AOR: 6.56; 95% CI: 1.16-37.11).
   Conclusions: Patient satisfaction at the private wing and regular adult OPDs' of public hospitals had no statistically significant difference. Female sex and information on the prevention of recurrent illnesses were factors positively affected patient satisfaction at regular services, whereas at private wing OPDs' age, attended elementary school, and accessibility of latrines were factors that positively affected patient satisfaction.

AB Background: Unequal access to inpatient rehabilitation after stroke has been reported. We sought to identify and compare patient and service factors associated with referral and admission to an inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) after acute hospital care for stroke in two countries with publicly-funded healthcare.
   Methods: We compared two cohorts of stroke patients admitted consecutively to eight acute public hospitals in Australia in 2013-2014 (n = 553), and to one large university hospital in Norway in 2012-2013 (n = 723). Outcomes were: referral to an IRF; admission to an IRF if referred. Logistic regression models were used to identify and compare factors associated with each outcome.
   Results: Participants were similar in both cohorts: mean age 73 years, 40-44% female, 12-13% intracerebral haemorrhage, similar to 77% mild stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale < 8). Services received during the acute admission differed (Australia vs. Norway): stroke unit treatment 82% vs. 97%, physiotherapy 93% vs. 79%, occupational therapy 83% vs. 77%, speech therapy 78% vs. 13%. Proportions referred to an IRF were: 48% (Australia) and 37% (Norway); proportions admitted: 35% (Australia) and 28% (Norway). Factors associated with referral in both countries were: moderately severe stroke, receiving stroke unit treatment or allied health assessments during the acute admission, living in the community, and independent pre-stroke mobility. Directions of associations were mostly congruent; however younger patients were more likely to be referred and admitted in Norway only. Models for admission among patients referred identified few associated factors suggesting that additional factors were important for this stage of the process.
   Conclusions: Similar factors were associated with referral to inpatient rehabilitation after acute stroke in both countries, despite differing service provision and access rates. Assuming it is not feasible to provide inpatient rehabilitation to all patients following stroke, the criteria for the selection of candidates need to be understood to address unwanted biases.

AB Background: The reform of county-level public hospitals is a breakthrough in the new era of healthcare reform in China and has attracted considerable attention since 2012. Continuous and efficient operations of hospital are primary concerns of this reform. To ensure the effectiveness of county-based intervention reform measures in Chongqing, it is significant to understand how hospital and county characteristics are associated with county-level public hospital efficiency due to significant development differences between counties. This study identifies the trajectory of hospital efficiency over time and determinants. It will also provide preliminary references for advancing reform.
   Methods: This study employs data from the Chongqing Regional Health Information Platform, Chongqing Health and Family Planning Statistical Yearbook, and Chongqing Statistical Yearbook for 2012-2016. A three-level growth model is used to estimate the efficiency growth trajectories within the contexts of hospitals and counties.
   Results: The intra-hospital level factors that affect the initial efficiency include government financial assistance, daily charge per bed, total assets turnover, number of hospital healthcare technicians, and medical costs per 100-yuan medical income. Inter-hospital variance is explained by hospital type. Inter-county level factors affecting the growth rate include the number of healthcare technicians per 1000 people and population density of the county. The interaction effect of the number of hospital healthcare technicians, hospital type, and number of healthcare technicians per 1000 people on hospital efficiency growth is significant.
   Conclusions: This study identifies determinants that contribute to efficiency changes in public county-hospitals over time by using a three-level growth model. The differences in efficiency are associated with intra-hospital, inter-hospital, and inter-county characteristics in Chongqing, which provides useful insight into government decision-making and the progress of reform. The stability and reasonable increase in the number of healthcare technicians in a county are the key factors that improve the efficiency. Further reform should focus on maternal and child healthcare hospitals for increasing investment and implementing government compensation.

AB Background: The aim of the study was to identify the proportion of female sex workers, men who have sex with men, and people who inject drugs who had accessed HIV prevention services at public health facilities and peer-led facilities, their level of satisfaction with these services, and perceived barriers and challenges to accessing HIV services from public and peer-led HIV prevention service providers.
   Methods: A mixed-method approach was used to collect data from key populations in the four states in Nigeria. Quantitative data collected included level of satisfaction with and barriers to use of public and peer-led facilities. In-depth interviews and focus-group discussions were conducted to explore reasons for satisfaction with and barriers to use of services. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were was conducted for quantitative data. Qualitative data were summaried, emerging themes identified, described and quotes reflecting the themes corresponding to interview questions highlighted.
   Results: Nine hundred sixty-seven persons responded to questions on the use of public health or/and peer-led facilities. Two hundred thirty-eight (49.4%) respondents had received HIV and sexual and reproductive health services through public health facilities, and 236 (48.7%) had received the services through peer-led facilities. Significantly more respondents were satisfied with the quality of services provided by peer-led organisations than with public health facilities with respect to service providers listening to respondent's problems and concerns (p = 0.007),privacy and confidentiality (p = 0.04) and respect of rights of service recipients (p = 0.04). Significantly more respondents using peer-led organisations than those using public health facilities identified no barriers to service access (p = 0.003). More respondents using public health facilities than peer-led facilities identified cost of services (p = 0.01), confidentiality (p = 0.002), waiting time (p < 0.01) and staff attitude (p = 0.001) as barriers to service access. Thee was no difference in the proportion of respondents willing to discontinue their use of either facilities (p = 0.08). Qualitative data revealed that concerns with access of services at the public health facility were due mainly to stigma and the effects of the same-sex prohibition law.
   Conclusion: Key populations were more satisfied receiving HIV prevention services at peer-led organisations than at public health facilities.

AB Background: Preterm birth is a worldwide challenge with the highest burden in low- and middle-income countries. Despite availability of low-cost interventions to decrease mortality of preterm, low birth weight, and sick newborns, these interventions are not well integrated in the health systems of low- and middle-income countries. The aim of this study was to assess, from the perspective of key stakeholders comprising leaders in the public health system, the health system readiness to support health care facilities in the care provided to preterm, low birth weight, and sick newborns in different regions of Ethiopia.
   Methods: A qualitative assessment using in-depth interviews with health facility leaders was conducted in health facilities in 3 regions of Ethiopia from December 2017 to February 2018. The interview guide was developed using a modified version of the World Health Organization health system building blocks.
   Results: Across the public health system, adequate and reliable space, power, and water were problematic. Human resource issues (training, staffing, and retention) were critical to being able to properly care for preterm, low birth weight, and sick newborns. Problems with functional equipment and equipment distribution systems were widespread. Funds were lacking to support preterm, low birth weight, and sick newborn needs in facilities. Data collection practices, data quality, and data utilization were all problematic. There were gaps in the availability of guidelines and protocols, specifically targeting preterm, low birth weight, and sick newborn care. Key facilitators, information disseminators, and influencers identified in the study were the Health Development Army, community and religious leaders, and mothers and families who had had positive experiences or outcomes of care.
   Conclusions: The Ethiopian health system has opportunities across all 7 World Health Organization health system building blocks to strengthen readiness to support health facilities to provide quality care and improve outcomes for preterm, low birth weight, and sick newborns.

   from a repeated cross sectional study using propensity score matching
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Voucher; Preventive care; Disease prevention; Chronic disease
ID HEALTH-CARE; SERVICES
AB Background: Vouchers are increasingly used as a demand-side subsidy to reduce financial hardship and improve quality of services. Elderly Healthcare Voucher Scheme has been introduced by the Hong Kong Government since 2009 to provide subsidy to elderly aged 65 and above to visit ten different types of private primary care providers for curative, preventive and chronic disease management. Several enhancements have been made over the past few years. This paper (as part of an evaluation study of this unique healthcare voucher scheme) aims to assess the long term impact of the voucher scheme in encouraging the use of primary care services.
   Methods: Two rounds of cross-sectional survey among elderly in Hong Kong were conducted in 2010 and 2016. Propensity score matching and analysis were used to compare changes in perception and usage of vouchers over time.
   Results: 61.5% of respondents in 2016 agreed "the scheme encourages me to use more private primary care services", a significant increase from 36.2% in 2010. Among those who agreed in 2016, the majority thought the voucher scheme would encourage them to use acute services (90.3%) in the private sector, rather than preventive care (40.3%) and chronic disease management (12.2%). Respondents also reported that their current usual choice of care was visiting "both public and private doctors" (61.9%), representing a significant increase (up from 48.4%) prior to their use of voucher.
   Conclusions: The voucher scheme has encouraged the use of more private care services, particularly acute services rather than disease prevention or management of chronic disease. However, there needs to be caution that the untargeted and open-ended nature of voucher scheme could result in supply-induced demand which would affect long term financial sustainability. The dual utilization of health services in both the public and private sector may also compromise continuity and quality of care. The design of the voucher needs to be more specific, targeting prevention and chronic disease management rather than unspecified care which is mainly acute and episodic in order to maximize service delivery capacity as a whole for equitable access in universal health coverage and to contribute to a sustainable financing system.

AB Background: Acute diarrhea is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children particularly in developing countries of Asia and Africa. The present study was conducted to detect the two most important pathogens, rotavirus and Campylobacter Jejuni in children suffering with diarrhea in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, Pakistan in 2014. The clinical and epidemiological aspects of the disease were also investigated.
   Methods: A total of 500 stool samples were collected from children presented with clinical signs and symptoms of acute diarrhea. The samples were initially screened for the presence of rotavirus A (RVA) via ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and RT-PCR (Reverse Transcriptase PCR) and then were analysed for C. jejuni by using species specific PCR assay.
   Results: The detection rate of RVA was 26.4% (132/500) while, Campylobacter was detected in 52% (260/500) of samples with C. jejuni accounted for 48.2% (241/500) of all study cases. Co-infection of C. jejuni with RVA was identified in 21.8% of all cases. Children with RVA and C. jejuni co-infection showed a higher probability (p=0.01) to be dehydrated. A significant association (p=0.02) was found between C. jejuni positive status and fever in children. The median age of children with both RVA and C. jejuni infection was 6-11months. The RVA detection rate was high in winter months of the year while, C. jejuni infections were documented high in summer over 1 year study period.
   Conclusions: The overall results have demonstrated the high prevalence of C. jejuni in Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Pakistan in 2014. The results of present study will not only help to calculate disease burden caused by C. jejuni and rotavirus but also will provide critical information to health authorities in planning public health care strategies against these pathogens.

AB Background Zika virus (ZIKV) infection gained public health concern after the 2015 outbreak in Brazil, when microcephaly rates increased in babies born from infected mothers. It was demonstrated that ZIKV causes a congenital Zika virus syndrome, including various alterations in the development of the central nervous system. Although the infection of cells from the nervous system has been well documented, less is known in respect of ZIKV ability to infect immune cells. Herein, we investigated if peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), freshly-isolated from healthy donors, could be infected by ZIKV. Methods PBMCs from healthy donors were isolated and cultured in medium with ZIKV strain Rio-U1 (MOI = 0.1). Infection was analyzed by RT-qPCR and flow cytometry. Results We detected the ZIKV RNA in PBMCs from all donors by RT-qPCR analysis. The detection of viral antigens by flow cytometry revealed that PBMC from more than 50% the donors were infected by ZIKV, with CD3(+)CD4(+) T cells, CD3(-)CD19(+) B cells and CD3(+)CD8(+) T cells being, respectively, the most frequently infected subpopulations, followed by CD14(+) monocytes. Additionally, we observed high variability in PBMC infection rates among different donors, either by numbers or type infected cells. Conclusions These findings raise the hypothesis that PBMCs can act as a reservoir of the virus, which may facilitate viral dissemination to different organs, including immune-privileged sites.

AB Background Malaria and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection constitute public health problems in Cameroon including the South West Region (SWR). This study determined the prevalence of malaria parasites and haematological abnormalities in HIV positive patients in Limbe, Cameroon from April-July 2014. Methods The study was cross-sectional and involved 411 participants who were administered structured questionnaires to record socio-demographic and clinical data. Three hundred and nine (309) HIV positive patients and one hundred and two (102) HIV negative individuals were examined clinically and venous blood collected for malaria parasite detection, HIV infection diagnosis and full blood count analysis. Results Overall malaria parasite prevalence was 14.1% (58/411). This prevalence was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in the HIV negative participants (33.3%, 34/102) compared to the HIV positive patients (7.8%, 24/309). Amongst HIV positive participants, malaria parasite prevalence was significantly higher in female patients (P = 0.003), febrile patients (P < 0.001), anaemic patients (P = 0.015) and in patients who were not on antiretroviral treatment (ART) (P = 0.03) when compared with their respective counterparts. Among the HIV negative group, though not significant, malaria parasite prevalence was higher in females, febrile and anaemic patients when compared with their respective counterparts. Overall anaemia prevalence was 52.1% (214/309) and was significantly higher (P = 0.004) in HIV positive patients (56%, 173) than in HIV negative participants (40.2%, 41). Malaria/HIV co-infected patients had a significantly lower mean value of Hb (P = 0.002), RBC (P = 0.002) and Hct (P = 0.001) when compared with HIV-infected patients. Conclusion HIV negative participants had a higher prevalence of malaria parasites than their HIV positive counterparts. Anaemia prevalence was higher in HIV positive patients than in HIV negative participants. Malaria/HIV co-infected patients presented with more red blood cell abnormalities than HIV-infected patients.

AB Background With worldwide distribution and importance for veterinary medicine, Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia duodenalis, and Enterocytozoon bieneusi have been found in a wide variety of vertebrate hosts. At present, few available molecular data can be used to understand the features of genetic diversity of these pathogens in areas without or less intensive farming. Dominated by grazing, Tibet is a separate geographic unit in China and yaks are in frequent contact with local herdsmen and necessary for their daily life. Therefore, to investigate the distribution of these pathogens in yaks of Tibet, 577 fecal specimens were screened using nested PCR for the presence and genotypes of the three intestinal pathogens. Results The overall prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp., G. duodenalis, and E. bieneusi were 1.4% (8/577), 1.7% (10/577), and 5.0% (29/577), respectively. Cryptosporidium andersoni (n = 7) and Cryptosporidium bovis (n = 1) were detected by sequence analysis of the SSU rRNA gene. Genotyping at the SSU rRNA and triosephosphate isomerase genes suggested that all G. duodenalis positive specimens belonged to assemblage E. Sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer gene identified six known E. bieneusi genotypes: BEB4 (n = 11), I (n = 6), D (n = 5), J (n = 2), CHC8 (n = 1), and BEB6 (n = 1). One subtype (A5,A4,A2,A1) for C. andersoni and three multilocus genotypes for E. bieneusi were identified by multilocus sequence typing. Conclusions We report for the first time the status of three enteric pathogens infection simultaneously for grazing yaks in Tibet. Yaks in our study are likely to impose a low zoonotic risk for humans. The molecular epidemiology data add to our knowledge of the characteristics of distribution and transmission for these pathogens in Tibet and their zoonotic potential and public health significance.

SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH

DT Article
DE State; Health; Inequalities; Sub-Saharan Africa
ID COUNTRIES; COVERAGE; INDEX
AB Background The paper argues that unlike the income literature, the public health literature has not paid much attention to the distribution of substantial improvements in health outcomes over the last decade or more, especially, in the Sub-Saharan African (SSA) context. Thus, the paper examines current levels of utilisation, changes in utilisation as well as inequality in utilisation of reproductive health services over the last 10 years in SSA. Methods The paper uses two rounds of Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from 30 SSA countries (latest round) and 21 countries (earlier round) to compute simple frequencies, cross-tabulated frequencies and concentration indices for health facility deliveries, skilled delivery assistance, 4+ antenatal visits and use of modern contraceptives. Results The results confirm the fact that utilisation of the selected reproductive health services have improved substantially over the last 10 year in several SSA countries. However, current levels of inequality in the use of reproductive health services are high in many countries. Interestingly, Guinea's pro-poor inequality in health facility delivery and skilled attendance at birth changed to pro-rich inequality, with the reverse being true in the case of use of modern contraceptives for Ghana, Malawi and Rawanda. The good news however is that in a lot of countries, the use of reproductive health services has increased while inequality has decreased within the period under study. Conclusion The paper argue that whiles income levels may play a key role in explaining the differences in utilisation and the levels of inequality, indepth studies may be needed to explain the reason for differential improvements and stagnation or deterioration in different countries. In this way, best practices from better performing countries can be documented and adapted by poor performing countries to improve their situation.

ID CLASSIFICATION-SYSTEM; CHALLENGES; MEDICARE; MODELS
AB Background The World Health Organization states there are three interrelated domains that are fundamental to achieving and maintaining universal access to care - raising sufficient funds for health care, reducing financial barriers to access by pooling funds in a way that prevents out-of-pocket costs, and allocating funds in a way that promotes quality, efficiency and equity. In Australia, a comprehensive account of the mechanisms for financing the health system have not been synthesised elsewhere. Therefore, to understand how the maternal health system is financed, this review aims to examine the mechanisms for funding, pooling and purchasing maternal health care and the influence these financing mechanisms have on the delivery of maternal health services in Australia. Methods We conducted a scoping review and interpretative synthesis of the financing mechanisms and their impact on Australia's maternal health system. Due to the nature of the study question, the review had a major focus on grey literature. The search was undertaken in three stages including; searching (1) Google search engine (2) targeted websites and (3) academic databases. Executive summaries and table of contents were screened for grey literature documents and Titles and s were screened for journal articles. Screening of publications' full-text followed. Data relating to either funding, pooling, or purchasing of maternal health care were extracted for synthesis. Results A total of 69 manuscripts were included in the synthesis, with 52 of those from the Google search engine and targeted website (grey literature) search. A total of 17 articles we included in the synthesis from the database search. Conclusion Our study provides a critical review of the mechanisms by which revenues are raised, funds are pooled and their impact on the way health care services are purchased for mothers and babies in Australia. Australia's maternal health system is financed via both public and private sources, which consequentially creates a two-tiered system. Mothers who can afford private health insurance - typically wealthier, urban and non-First Nations women - therefore receive additional benefits of private care, which further exacerbates inequity between these groups of mothers and babies. The increasing out of pocket costs associated with obstetric care may create a financial burden for women to access necessary care or it may cause them to skip care altogether if the costs are too great.

AB Background: Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption is contributing to the obesity epidemic. On 28 March 2017, Catalonia enacted a law levying an excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages for public health reasons. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of the tax on the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages in Catalonia (Spain).
   Methods: Before-and-after study to assess changes in the prevalence of consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages among 1929 persons aged 12 to 40 years residing in low-income neighbourhoods of Barcelona (intervention) and Madrid (control). Beverage consumption frequency was ascertained via a validated questionnaire administered during the month prior to the tax's introduction (May 2017) and again at 1 year after it had come into force. The effect of the tax was obtained using Poisson regression models with robust variance weighted using propensity scores.
   Results: While the prevalence of regular consumers of taxed beverages fell by 39% in Barcelona as compared to Madrid, the prevalence of consumers of untaxed beverages remained stable. The main reason cited by more than two-thirds of those surveyed for reducing their consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages was the increase in price, followed by a heightened awareness of their health effects.
   Conclusions: The introduction of the Catalonian excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages was followed by a reduction in the prevalence of regular consumers of taxed beverages.

AB Background Caffeine containing energy drinks (EDs) are heavily consumed, particularly among young adults. The number of reports of caffeine intoxication from caffeinated EDs and problems related to caffeine dependence and withdrawal is increasing. The objective was to assess the knowledge and perceived beneficial effects of EDs consumers, to assess consumption patterns and determine the adverse effects experienced by different EDs consumer groups residing in Saudi Arabia. Methods An observational cross-sectional study with data from a randomly selected Saudi population was conducted during the period of January 15th, 2015, to April 15th, 2015, using a pre-tested 43-item questionnaire. The data were obtained and collected using interview questionnaires. Sociodemographic characteristics and data on EDs consumption patterns, the level of awareness among study subjects, and the purported benefits and reported adverse effects of EDs were collected. Frequency, percentage, and arithmetic means were calculated using Chi-square and ANOVA tests, and data with p < 0.05 were considered significant. Results Of the 816 individuals invited to participate in the study, 783 participants responded and completed interviews, response rate was 96%. Consumers attributed the popularity of EDs to massive advertising media (46.7%) and their stimulating and invigorating effects (37.5%). EDs are consumed by subjects for their effects on fatigue reduction (64.6%), increased alertness and focus (75.8%), and assistance during long driving trips (75.7%). Study subjects reported suffering from adverse effects, including mainly diuresis (53.7%), palpitations (50.7%), insomnia (50.7%). Importantly, an inverse association was identified between knowledge of EDs and consumption rate, and a proportional association was identified between experienced adverse effects and consumption frequency. Lower knowledge scores were identified in daily consumers than in 1-3 times monthly consumers; higher adverse events were experienced by daily consumers than by 1-3 times monthly consumers. The majority of consumers (84.6%) recommended that authorities should regulate EDs consumption. Conclusions Excessive EDs consumption is associated with an increased risk of experiencing several adverse events, which is commensurate with published studies. Increasing knowledge about EDs and their possible risks could decrease their consumption by the general public.

AB Background: Obesity has become a major public health problem. Innovative treatments are necessary. Internet and new technologies have been reported effective results in weight control programs, especially those with personalized feedback. This paper presents the protocol for a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of an online weight control program, called en_linea, comparing with a standard group therapy and a control group.
   Methods: This is a randomized controlled trial with three intervention arms: en_linea, standard group therapy and control group. To perform this study, 305 adults (18-65 years) with overweight type II (27-29.9 kg/m(2)) or obesity type I (30-34.9 kg/m(2)) will be invited to participate. Interventions will last 17 weeks with follow-ups 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the post-treatment appointment. The primary outcome will be post-treatment weight loss and the maintenance during the follow-ups. Secondary outcomes will be adherence rates, drop outs and quality of life. Participants will be assessed before randomization and they will be sign an inform consent.
   Discussion: The future challenge is to design innovative obesity treatments. Internet could be a useful tool to improve traditional weight control programs. This new intervention format is appropriate for patients who prefer not to share their intimate problems with a group, and for the new generations who feel comfortable using new technologies.

AB Background Although several studies assessed the prevalence of alveolar bone loss, the association with several risk factors has not been fully investigated. The aim of this article is to measure the prevalence of periodontitis by calculating the mean alveolar bone loss/level of posterior teeth using bitewing radiographs among the patients enrolled in the clinics at Harvard School of Dental Medicine and address risk factors associated with the disease. Methods One thousand one hundred thirty-one patients were selected for radiographic analysis to calculate the mean alveolar bone loss/level by measuring the distance between the cementoenamel junction and the alveolar bone crest on the mesial and distal surfaces of posterior teeth. Linear regression with Multi-level mixed-effect model was used for statistical analysis adjusting for age, sex, race, median household income, and other variables. Results Mean alveolar bone level of the whole sample was 1.30 mm (+/- 0.006). Overall periodontitis prevalence for the sample was 55.5% (+/- 1.4%). Moderate periodontitis prevalence was 20.7% (+/- 1.2%), while 2.8% (+/- 0.5%) of the whole sample had severe periodontitis. Adjusted mean alveolar bone loss was higher in older age groups, males, Asian race group, ever smokers, and patients with low median household income. Conclusion The effect of high household income on the amount of bone loss can be powerful to the degree that high household income can influence outcomes even for individuals who had higher risks of developing the disease. Public health professionals and clinicians need to collaborate with policy makers to achieve and sustain high quality of healthcare for everyone.

AB Background Research on the health and wellbeing of retirees has tended to focus on financial security and financial planning. However, we suggest that one reason why financial security is important for retirees is that it enables social connectedness, which is critical for healthy ageing. Methods This paper tests this hypothesis cross-sectionally (N = 3109) and longitudinally (N = 404) using a population-weighted mixed effects mediation model in two nationally representative samples of Australian retirees. Results Analyses provide robust support for our model. Subjective financial security predicted retiree health cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Social connectedness also consistently predicted mental health and physical health, on average four times more strongly than financial security. Furthermore, social connectedness partially accounted for the protective effect of subjective financial security. Conclusions We discuss the implications of these findings for public health, with a particular emphasis on how social connectedness can be better supported for people transitioning to retirement.

AB Background The lack of adequate and detailed epidemiological data of Parkinson's disease (PD), especially in Asia, is a barrier to future disease burdens and the prospect of effective public health plans. This study aimed to investigate temporal trends in the incidence and prevalence of PD in South Korea from 2010 to 2015, based on uniform diagnostic criteria. Methods This study examined all PD patients registered in a South Korean national registry database of more than 50 million individuals. We analyzed the incidence and prevalence of PD according to age, gender, and region. Results The annual incidence of PD was between 22.4-27.8 cases per 100,000 individuals. During the 6-year study period, there were 73,726 new PD patients, 42.3% of whom were men. The standardized incidence of PD increased over time in men but remained constant in women until 2013 but began to increase in 2014. The female-to-male ratio in the incidence of PD was 1.4:1 while the female-to-male ratio in the prevalence of PD was 1.6:1. The age- and gender-standardized prevalence of PD increased from 115.9 cases per 100,000 individuals in 2010 to 139.8 cases per 100,000 individuals in 2015. From 2014, the incidence and prevalence of PD peaked in individuals aged between 80 and 89 years in both men and women. Regional analysis also showed an increased prevalence of PD in all regions of Korea. Conclusions The incidence and prevalence of PD in Korea were higher in women and increased gradually from 2010 to 2015. The findings may contribute to epidemiological studies of PD in Asia, and may provide clues on risk factors for PD.

AB Background Continuing education aims at assisting physicians to maintain competency and expose them to emerging issues in their field. Over the last decade, approaches to the delivery of educational content have changed dramatically as medical education at all levels is now benefitting from the use of web-based content and applications for mobile devices. The aim of the present study is to investigate through a randomized trial the effectiveness of a smart phone application to increase public health service physicians' (PHS physicians) knowledge regarding pediatric oral health care. Method Five of all seven DHCs (District Health Center) in Tehran, which were under the supervision of Tehran University of Medical Sciences and Iran University of Medical Sciences, were selected for our study. Physicians of one DHC had participated in a pilot study. All PHS physicians in the other four centers were invited to the current study on a voluntary basis (n = 107). They completed a self-administered questionnaire regarding their knowledge, attitudes, practice in pediatric dentistry, and background. PHS physicians were assigned randomly to intervention and control groups; those in the intervention group, received a newly designed evidence-based smartphone application, and those in the control group received a booklet, a CME seminar, and a pamphlet. A post-intervention survey was administered 4 months later and t-test and repeated measures ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance) were performed to measure the difference in the PHS physicians' knowledge, attitude and practice. Results In both groups, the mean knowledge scores were significantly higher (p-Value < 0.001) in post-intervention data compared to those at baseline. Similar results existed in attitude and practice scores. Although the scores in knowledge in the intervention group indicating potentially greater improvement when compared to those of the control group, the differences between the two groups were not statistically significant (dif: 0.84, 95% CI - 0.35 to 2.02). Conclusion In the light of the limitations of the present study, smart phone applications could improve knowledge, attitude and practice in physicians although this method was not superior to the conventional method of CME.

AB Background Postpartum depression is the most common complication of childbearing age women and is a considerable public health problem. The transition into motherhood is a difficult period that involves significant changes in the psychological, social and physiological aspects, and has increased vulnerability for the development of mental illness. More than 1 in 10 pregnant women and 1 in 20 postnatal women in Ethiopia suffer from undetected depression. Methods Community based cross sectional study was conducted among 596 postpartum mothers in Ankesha District, North West Ethiopia, from February 01 to March 2, 2018. One stage cluster sampling technique was employed to get the study participants. The objective was to assess the prevalence and associated factors of postpartum depression among mothers who gave birth in the last Twelve months in Ankesha District, Awi Zone, North West Ethiopia, 2018. The interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data and Eden Burg Postpartum Depression Scale was used to assess postpartum depression with cutoff point >= 8. The data were entered into Epi data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 24 for analysis. All variables with P < 0.25 in the bivariate analysis were included in the final model and statistical significance was declared at P < 0.05. Result In this study, a total of 596 study participants were involved making a response rate of 97.4%, the prevalence of postpartum depression was 23.7% with 95%CI: 20.3-27.2. From the participant mothers who are divorced/widowed/unmarried (AOR = 3.45 95%CI: 1.35-8.82), unwanted pregnancy (AOR = 1.95 95%CI: 1.14-3.33), unpreferred infant sex (AOR = 1.79 95%CI: 1.13-2.86), infant illness (AOR = 2.08 95%CI: 1.30-3.34) and low social support (AOR = 3.16 95% CI: 1.55-6.43) was independent predictors of postpartum depression. Conclusion Almost a quarter (23.7%) of women suffers from postpartum depression. Marital status, unwanted pregnancy, unwanted infant sex, infant illness, and low social support were independent predictors of postpartum depression. Therefore, integration of mental illness with maternal and child health care is important, information communication education and behavioral change communications on postpartum depression are better been given attention.

AB Background Demographic changes, increased life expectancy and the associated rise in chronic diseases pose challenges to public health care systems. Optimized treatment methods and integrated concepts of care are potential solutions to overcome increasing financial burdens and improve quality of care. In this context modeling is a powerful tool to evaluate potential benefits of different treatment procedures on health outcomes as well as health care budgets. This work presents a novel modeling approach for simulating different treatment procedures of heart failure patients based on extensive data sets from outpatient and inpatient care. Methods Our hybrid heart failure model is based on discrete event and agent based methodologies and facilitates the incorporation of different therapeutic procedures for outpatient and inpatient care on patient individual level. The state of health is modeled with the functional classification of the New York Heart Association (NYHA), strongly affecting discrete state transition probabilities alongside age and gender. Cooperation with Austrian health care and health insurance providers allowed the realization of a detailed model structure based on clinical data of more than 25,000 patients. Results Simulation results of conventional care and a telemonitoring program underline the unfavorable prognosis for heart failure and reveal the correlation of NYHA classes with health and economic outcomes. Average expenses for the treatment of NYHA class IV patients of euro10,077 +/- euro165 were more than doubled compared to other classes. The selected use case of a telemonitoring program demonstrated potential cost savings within two years of application. NYHA classes II and III revealed most potential for additional treatment measures. Conclusion The presented model allows performing extensive simulations of established treatment procedures for heart failure patients and evaluating new holistic methods of care and innovative study designs. This approach offers health care providers a unique, adaptable and comprehensive tool for decision making in the complex and socioeconomically challenging field of cardiovascular diseases.

AB Background Engaging those who influence, administer and/or who are active users ("knowledge users") of health care systems, as co-producers of health research, can help to ensure that research products will better address real world needs. Our aim was to identify and review frameworks of knowledge user engagement in health research in a systematic manner, and to describe the concepts comprising these frameworks. Methods An international team sharing a common interest in knowledge user engagement in health research used a consensus-building process to: 1) agree upon criteria to identify articles, 2) screen articles to identify existing frameworks, 3) extract, analyze data, and 4) synthesize and report the concepts of knowledge user engagement described in health research frameworks. We utilized the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute Engagement in Health Research Literature Explorer (PCORI Explorer) as a source of articles related to engagement in health research. The search includes articles from May 1995 to December 2017. Results We identified 54 articles about frameworks for knowledge user engagement in health research and report on 15 concepts. The average number of concepts reported in the 54 articles is n = 7, and ranges from n = 1 to n = 13 concepts. The most commonly reported concepts are: knowledge user - prepare, support (n = 44), relational process (n = 39), research agenda (n = 38). The least commonly reported concepts are: methodology (n = 8), methods (n = 10) and analysis (n = 18). In a comparison of articles that report how research was done (n = 26) versus how research should be done (n = 28), articles about how research was done report concepts more often and have a higher average number of concepts (n = 8 of 15) in comparison to articles about how research should be done (n = 6 of 15). The exception is the concept "evaluate" and that is more often reported in articles that describe how research should be done. Conclusions We propose that research teams 1) consider engagement with the 15 concepts as fluid, and 2) consider a form of partnered negotiation that takes place through all phases of research to identify and use concepts appropriate to their team needs. There is a need for further work to understand concepts for knowledge user engagement.

TI Assessing the capacity of Malawi's district and central hospitals to
   manage traumatic diaphyseal femoral fractures in adults
SO PLOS ONE

   CAPACITY; INJURIES; DISEASE; SURGERY; CHALLENGES; HEALTH; EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Background
   The burden of musculoskeletal trauma is growing worldwide, disproportionately affecting low-income countries like Malawi. However, resources required to manage musculoskeletal trauma remain inadequate. A detailed understanding of the current capacity of Malawian public hospitals to manage musculoskeletal trauma is unknown and necessary for effective trauma system development planning.
   Methods
   We developed a list of infrastructure, manpower, and material resources used during treatment of adult femoral shaft fractures-a representative injury managed non-operatively and operatively in Malawi. We identified, by consensus of at least 7 out of 10 experts, which items were essential at district and central hospitals. We surveyed orthopaedic providers in person at all 25 district and 4 central hospitals in Malawi on the presence, availability, and reasons for unavailability of essential resources. We validated survey responses by performing simultaneous independent on-site assessments of 25% of the hospitals.
   Results
   No district or central hospital in Malawi had available all the essential resources to adequately manage femoral fractures. On average, district hospitals had 71% (range 41-90%) of essential resources, with at least 15 of 25 reporting unavailability of inpatient ward nurses, x-ray, external fixators, gauze and bandages, and walking assistive devices. District hospitals offered only non-operative treatment, though 24/25 reported barriers to performing skeletal traction. Central hospitals reported an average of 76% (71-85%) of essential resources, with at least 2 of 4 hospitals reporting unavailability of full blood count, inpatient hospital beds, a procedure room, an operating room, casualty/A&E department clinicians, orthopaedic clinicians, a circulating nurse, inpatient ward nurses, electrocardiograms, x-ray, suture, and walking assistive devices. All four central hospitals reported barriers to performing skeletal traction. Operative treatment of femur fracture with a reliable supply of implants was available at 3/4 hospitals, though 2/3 were dependent entirely on foreign donations.
   Conclusion
   We identified critical deficiencies in infrastructure, manpower, and essential resources at district and central hospitals in Malawi. Our findings provide evidence-based guidance on how to improve the musculoskeletal trauma system in Malawi, by identifying where and why essential resources were unavailable when needed.

   THEORY; WARM-GLOW; ALTRUISM; MOTIVATION; COOPERATION; NONDONORS; EMPATHY
AB Advances in digital technology have led to large amounts of personal data being recorded and retained by industry, constituting an invaluable asset to private organizations. The implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation in the EU, including the UK, fundamentally reshaped how data is handled across every sector. It enables the general public to access data collected about them by organisations, opening up the possibility of this data being used for research that benefits the public themselves; for example, to uncover lifestyle causes of poor health outcomes. A significant barrier for using this commercial data for academic research, however, is the lack of publicly acceptable research frameworks. Data donation-the act of an individual actively consenting to donate their personal data for research-could enable the use of commercial data for the benefit of society. However, it is not clear which motives, if any, would drive people to donate their personal data for this purpose. In this paper we present the results of a large-scale survey (N = 1,300) that studied intentions and reasons to donate personal data. We found that over half of individuals are willing to donate their personal data for research that could benefit the wider general public. We identified three distinct reasons to donate personal data: an opportunity to achieve selfbenefit, social duty, and the need to understand the purpose of data donation. We developed a questionnaire to measure those three reasons and provided further evidence on the validity of the scales. Our results demonstrate that these reasons predict people's intentions to donate personal data over and above generic altruistic motives. We show that a social duty is the strongest predictor of the intention to donate personal data, while understanding the purpose of data donation also positively predicts the intentions to donate personal data. In contrast, self-serving motives show a negative association with intentions to donate personal data. The findings presented here examine people's reasons for data donation to help inform the ethical use of commercially collected personal data for academic research for public good.

TI Defining hospital community benefit activities using Delphi technique: A
   comparison between China and the United States
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PUBLIC-HEALTH SYSTEM
AB Introduction
   Currently there is no expert consensus regarding what activities and programs constitute hospital community benefits. In China, the hospital community benefit movement started gaining attention after the recent health care system reform in 2009. In the United States, the Internal Revenue Service and the nonprofit hospital sector have struggled to define community benefit for many years. More recently, under the Affordable Care Act (ACA)'s new "community benefit" requirements, nonprofit hospitals further developed these benefits to qualify for 501(c)(3) tax exempt status.
   Methods
   The Delphi survey method was used to explore activities and/or programs that are considered to be hospital community benefits in China and the United States. Twenty Chinese and 19 American of academics, senior hospital managers and policy makers were recruited as experts and participated in two rounds of surveys. The survey questionnaire was first developed in China using the 5-point Likert scale to rate the support for certain hospital community benefits activities; it was then translated into English. The questionnaires were modified after the first round of Delphi. After two rounds of surveys, only responses with a minimum of 70 percent support rate were accepted by the research team.
   Results
   Delphi survey results show that experts from China and the U.S. agree on 68.75 percent of HCB activities and/or programs, including emergency preparedness, social benefit activities, bad debt /Medicaid shortfall, disaster relief, environmental protection, health promotion and education, education and research, charity care, medical services with positive externality, provision of low profit services, and sliding scale fees.
   Conclusions
   In China, experts believe that healthcare is a "human right" and that the government has the main responsibility of ensuring affordable access to healthcare for its citizens. Meanwhile, healthcare is considered a commodity in the U.S., and many Americans, especially those who are vulnerable and low-income, are not able to afford and access needed healthcare services. Though the U.S. government recognized the importance of community benefit and included a section in the ACA that outlines new community benefit requirements for nonprofit hospitals, there is a need to issue specific policies regarding the amounts and types of community benefits non-profit hospitals should provide to receive tax exemption status.

AB Background: Clinical guidelines and public health authorities lack recommendations on scalable approaches to defining and monitoring the occurrence and severity of bleeding in populations prescribed antithrombotic therapy.
   Methods: We examined linked primary care, hospital admission and death registry electronic health records (CALIBER 1998-2010, England) of patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation, acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina or stable angina with the aim to develop algorithms for bleeding events. Using the developed bleeding phenotypes, Kaplan-Meier plots were used to estimate the incidence of bleeding events and we used Cox regression models to assess the prognosis for all-cause mortality, atherothrombotic events and further bleeding.
   Results: We present electronic health record phenotyping algorithms for bleeding based on bleeding diagnosis in primary or hospital care, symptoms, transfusion, surgical procedures and haemoglobin values. In validation of the phenotype, we estimated a positive predictive value of 0.88 (95% CI 0.64, 0.99) for hospitalised bleeding. Amongst 128,815 patients, 27,259 (21.2%) had at least 1 bleeding event, with 5-year risks of bleeding of 29.1%, 21.9%, 25.3% and 23.4% following diagnoses of atrial fibrillation, acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina and stable angina, respectively. Rates of hospitalised bleeding per 1000 patients more than doubled from 1.02 (95% CI 0.83, 1.22) in January 1998 to 2.68 (95% CI 2.49, 2.88) in December 2009 coinciding with the increased rates of antiplatelet and vitamin K antagonist prescribing. Patients with hospitalised bleeding and primary care bleeding, with or without markers of severity, were at increased risk of all-cause mortality and atherothrombotic events compared to those with no bleeding. For example, the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 1.98 (95% CI 1.86, 2.11) for primary care bleeding with markers of severity and 1.99 (95% CI 1.92, 2.05) for hospitalised bleeding without markers of severity, compared to patients with no bleeding.
   Conclusions: Electronic health record bleeding phenotyping algorithms offer a scalable approach to monitoring bleeding in the population. Incidence of bleeding has doubled in incidence since 1998, affects one in four cardiovascular disease patients, and is associated with poor prognosis. Efforts are required to tackle this iatrogenic epidemic.

AB Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health problem, exhibiting sharp increases in incidence, prevalence, and attributable morbidity and mortality. There is a critical need to better understand the demographics, clinical characteristics, and key risk factors for CKD; and to develop platforms for testing novel interventions to improve modifiable risk factors, particularly for the CKD patients with a rapid decline in kidney function.
   Methods: We describe a novel collaboration between two large healthcare systems (Providence St. Joseph Health and University of California, Los Angeles Health) supported by leadership from both institutions, which was created to develop harmonized cohorts of patients with CKD or those at increased risk for CKD (hypertension/HTN, diabetes/DM, pre-diabetes) from electronic health record data.
   Results: The combined repository of candidate records included more than 3.3 million patients with at least a single qualifying measure for CKD and/or at-risk for CKD. The CURE-CKD registry includes over 2.6 million patients with and/or at-risk for CKD identified by stricter guide-line based criteria using a combination of administrative encounter codes, physical examinations, laboratory values and medication use. Notably, data based on race/ethnicity and geography in part, will enable robust analyses to study traditionally disadvantaged or marginalized patients not typically included in clinical trials.
   Discussion: CURE-CKD project is a unique multidisciplinary collaboration between nephrologists, endocrinologists, primary care physicians with health services research skills, health economists, and those with expertise in statistics, bio-informatics and machine learning. The CURE-CKD registry uses curated observations from real-world settings across two large healthcare systems and has great potential to provide important contributions for healthcare and for improving clinical outcomes in patients with and at-risk for CKD.

AB Background Traditional "inverted triangle" healthcare resources allocation model in China has wasted a lot of health resources. The Chinese health reform began to strengthens the role of the primary health institutions in delivering primary health care especially in rural areas in the background of large development gap between urban-rural health and rapid growth in the incidence of chronic diseases in rural. We take hypertensive patients as an example, to verify the effect of policy implementation through distribution characteristics of rural primary health institutions preference of hypertensive patients and explore the influencing factor that promoting rationalized use of medical care for patients with chronic disease as well as rational allocation of health resources in rural areas. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Heilongjiang, a province in northeastern China by using a self-designed questionnaire. Stratified cluster sampling was used to choose 484 hypertensive patients from two villages in Heilongjiang province in 2010. Results About 88.4% of respondents reported preferred primary health institutions (83.5% preferred village clinics and 4.9% preferred township hospitals), 49.4% of respondents knew hypertension management administered by primary health institutions, 53.5% received hypertension education from primary care physicians, more than half of respondents reported that they didn't receive telephone interviews and family visits from primary care physicians over the past 6 months. Residence closer to the primary health institutions (OR = 10.360), trust in village doctors (OR = 7.323), elders (OR = 3.001), and asked for return visits by primary health physicians (OR = 2.073) promote preferences for primary health institutions. Conclusions: Accessibility to primary healthcare and doctor-patient trust stimulate patients to choose the primary health institutions. Primary health institutions should improve general approach to hypertension management and enhance the ability of providing basic public health services.

AB Background Over time, the Brazilian health system, a growing country, has been developing to ensure good accessibility to health goods and services. This development is focusing on the principle of universality of access and completeness of health care. In this context, we aimed to evaluate the completeness of care and universality of access for women in their pregnancy and puerperal period in Ceara, Brazil. Methods A descriptive, cross-sectional study based on a quantitative approach, using information collected from the database of the regulation system of the state of Ceara and data from the Prenatal Monitoring System. The research population comprised of 1701 women who delivered a baby in an obstetric reference unit in the Health Macro-Region of Cariri, Ceara, Brazil from January to December 2015. Results There was a high rate of cesarean delivery (49.7%) and a high waiting time for access to high-risk delivery (32.6%) and neonatal intensive care unit (72.9%). There was also a low percentage (41.1%) of pregnant women undergoing an adequate number of prenatal consultations, dental care (20%), educational activities (15%), visits to the maternity ward (0.1%), laboratory tests of the third trimester (29.2%) and puerperal consultation (37.9%). Conclusions It was concluded that the Maternal and Child Health Policy, especially the Rede Cegonha, which is still under development, does not ensure access and completeness of care for women during the prenatal, delivery, and puerperal periods, thus violating their reproductive rights. The results of this study allow a critical analysis by the academia and health managers in search of strategies to improve the services of Rede Cegonha in Brazil.

ID ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE; SURVEILLANCE; SEROGROUPS; ENGLAND; O157
AB Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) can cause severe gastrointestinal disease and colonization among food handlers. In Japan, STEC infection is a notifiable disease, and food handlers are required to undergo routine stool examination for STEC. However, the molecular epidemiology of STEC is not entirely known. We investigated the genomic characteristics of STEC from patients and asymptomatic food handlers in Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on 65 STEC isolates obtained from 38 patients and 27 food handlers by public health surveillance in Miyagi Prefecture between April 2016 and March 2017. Isolates of O157:H7 ST11 and O26:H11 ST21 were predominant (n = 19, 29%, respectively). Non-O157 isolates accounted for 69% (n = 45) of all isolates. Among 48 isolates with serotypes found in the patients (serotype O157:H7 and 5 non-O157 serotypes, O26:H11, O103:H2, O103:H8, O121:H19 and O145:H28), adhesion genes eae, tir, and espB, and type III secretion system genes espA, espJ, nleA, nleB, and nleC were detected in 41 to 47 isolates (85-98%), whereas isolates with other serotypes found only in food handlers were negative for all of these genes. Non-O157 isolates were especially prevalent among patients younger than 5 years old. Shiga-toxin gene stx1a, adhesion gene efa1, secretion system genes espF and cif, and fimbrial gene lpfA were significantly more frequent among non-O157 isolates from patients than among O157 isolates from patients. The most prevalent resistance genes among our STEC isolates were aminoglycoside resistance genes, followed by sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim resistance genes. WGS revealed that 20 isolates were divided into 9 indistinguishable core genomes (< 5 SNPs), demonstrating clonal expansion of these STEC strains in our region, including an O26:H11 strain with stx1a+stx2a. Non-O157 STEC with multiple virulence genes were prevalent among both patients and food handlers in our region of Japan, highlighting the importance of monitoring the genomic characteristics of STEC.

AB Function is an important marker of health throughout the life course, however, in low-and-middle-income-countries, little is known about the burden of functional impairment as women transition from pregnancy to the first year post-partum. Leveraging longitudinal data from 960 women participating in the Share Child Cohort in Pakistan, this study sought to (1) characterize functional trajectories over time among women in their perinatal period and (2) assess predictors of chronic poor functioning following childbirth. We used a group-based trajectory modeling approach to examine maternal patterns of function from the third trimester of pregnancy through 12 months post-partum. Three trajectory groups were found: persistently well-functioning (51% of women), poor functioning with recovery (39% of women), and chronically poor functioning (10% of women). When compared to mothers in the highest functioning group, psychosocial characteristics (e.g., depression, stress, and serious life events) were significantly associated with sustained poor functioning one-year following child-birth. Mothers living in nuclear households were more likely to experience chronic poor functioning. Higher education independently predicted maternal function recovery, even when controlling for psychosocial characteristics. Education, above and beyond socio-economic assets, appears to play an important protective role in maternal functional trajectories following childbirth. Public health implications related to maternal function and perinatal mental health are discussed.

TI Multimorbidity and complex multimorbidity in Brazilian rural workers
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CHRONIC DISEASE; PREVALENCE; IMPACT
AB Objective
   To estimate the prevalence of multimorbidity and complex multimorbidity in rural workers and their association with sociodemographic characteristics, occupational contact with pesticides, lifestyle and clinical condition.
   Methods
   This is a cross-sectional epidemiological study with 806 farmers from the main agricultural municipality of the state of Espirito Santo/Brazil, conducted from December 2016 to April 2017. Multimorbidity was defined as the presence of two or more chronic diseases in the same individual, while complex multimorbidity was classified as the occurrence of three or more chronic conditions affecting three or more body systems. Socio-demographic data, occupational contact with pesticides, lifestyle data and clinical condition data were collected through a structured questionnaire. Binary logistic regression was conducted to identify risk factors for multimorbidity.
   Results
   The prevalence of multimorbidity among farmers was 41.5% (n = 328), and complex multimorbidity was 16.7% (n = 132). More than 77% of farmers had at least one chronic illness. Hypertension, dyslipidemia and depression were the most prevalent morbidities. Being 40 years or older (OR 3.33, 95% CI 2.06-5.39), previous medical diagnosis of pesticide poisoning (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.03-3.44), high waist circumference (OR 2.82, CI 95% 1.98-4.02) and worse health self-assessment (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.52-2.91) significantly increased the chances of multimorbidity. The same associations were found for the diagnosis of complex multimorbidity.
   Conclusion
   We identified a high prevalence of multimorbidity and complex multimorbidity among the evaluated farmers. These results were associated with increased age, abdominal fat, pesticide poisoning, and poor or fair health self-assessment. Public policies are necessary to prevent, control and treat this condition in this population.

AB Background: In the Netherlands, suicide rates showed a sharp incline and this pertains particularly to the province of Noord-Brabant, one of the southern provinces in the Netherlands. This calls for a regional suicide prevention effort.
   Methods/design: Study protocol. A regional suicide prevention systems intervention is implemented and evaluated by a stepped wedge trial design in five specialist mental health institutions and their adherent chain partners. Our system intervention is called SUPREMOCOL, which stands for Suicide Prevention by Monitoring and Collaborative Care, and focuses on four pillars: 1) recognition of people at risk for suicide by the development and implementation of a monitoring system with decision aid, 2) swift access to specialist care of people at risk, 3) positioning nurse care managers for collaborative care case management, and 4) 12 months telephone follow up. Eligible patients are persons attempting suicide or expressing suicidal ideation. Primary outcome is number of completed suicides, as reported by Statistics Netherlands and regional Public Health Institutes. Secondary outcome is number of attempted suicides, as reported by the regional ambulance transport and police. Suicidal ideation of persons registered in the monitoring system will, be assessed by the PHQ-9 and SIDAS questionnaires at baseline and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after registration, and used as exploratory process measure. The impact of the intervention will be evaluated by means of the RE-AIM dimensions reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. Intervention integrity will be assessed and taken into account in the analysis.
   Discussion: The present manuscript presents the design and development of the SUPREMOCOL study. The ultimate goal is to lower the completed suicides rate by 20%, compared to the control period and compared to other provinces in the Netherlands. Moreover, our goal is to provide specialist mental health institutions and chain partners with a sustainable and adoptable intervention for suicide prevention.

AB Background: The care given to newborns immediately within the first few hours of birth is critical for their survival. However, their survival depends on the health professional's knowledge and skills to deliver appropriate newborn care interventions. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the knowledge and practice of immediate newborn care among nurses and midwives in public health facilities of Afar Regional State, Northeast Ethiopia.
   Methods: Institution based cross-sectional study design was employed on 357 nurses and midwives working in 48 public health facilities (45 health centers and 3 hospitals) during April 2018. Data were collected using interviewer-administered questionnaire and observation checklist. Then, data were entered into Epi-info version 7.0 and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were carried out to estimate odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. A p-value less than 0.05 was used to declare statistical significance.
   Results: Overall, 53.8% [95% CI: (48.6, 59.0%)] and 62.7% [(95% CI: (57.7, 67.8%))] of the health professionals (midwives and nurses) had adequate knowledge and good practice on immediate newborn care, respectively. Working in hospital [AOR: 4.62; 95% CI (1.76, 12.10)], being a female [AOR: 0.59; 95% CI (0.39, 0.98)] and interested in providing newborn care [AOR: 0.29; 95% CI (0.13, 0.68)] were positively associated with having adequate knowledge on immediate newborn care. On the other hand, having work experience of < 5 years [AOR: 0.33; 95% CI (0.14, 0.78)], inadequate knowledge [AOR: 0.39; 95% CI (0.25, 0.64)], having work load [AOR: 2.09; 95% CI (1.17, 3.73)], being not interested to provide immediate newborn care [AOR: 0.35; 95% CI (0.16, 0.74)] and working in health center [AOR: 8.56; 95% CI (2.39, 30.63)] were negatively associated with good immediate newborn care practices.
   Conclusions: A significant number of nurses and midwives had inadequate knowledge and poor practice on immediate newborn care. Therefore, providing a comprehensive newborn care training and creating an opportunity for nurses and midwives working at health centers to share experience from those hired in hospitals are very crucial to improve their knowledge and skills on newborn care.

AB Background Neurological disorders are an economic and public health burden which requires efficient and adequate medical resources. Currently, little is known about the status of the quality of neurological care services available in China. As neurological primary care is mostly provided at the county hospital level, investigation of this geographical level is required. The aim of this study is to evaluate currently available neurology care services in Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomerations in east China. Methods A multi-site, county-level hospital-based observational survey was conducted in east China from January 2017 to December 2017. A questionnaire was made to assess hospital and the departmental patient care capabilities, human resources and technical capacity in neurology departments. Results Of 228 hospitals across the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomerations, 217 documents were returned. Of these, 22 were excluded due to invalid hospital information or duplicate submission. Overall, most hospitals have neurology departments (162, 83.1%) while less than half of the hospitals have a stroke center (80, 41.0%) and neurology emergency department (46, 23.6%). Among 162 hospitals with neurology department, 5 were excluded due to inadequate sharing, leaving 157 hospitals for analysis. About 84.1% of these neurology departments can administer intravenous thrombolysis while about one third of them has the ability to perform arterial thrombectomy (36.9%). In addition, 46.2% of hospitals can carry out computed tomography angiography (CTA) in emergency room. Tertiary care hospitals are much more equipped with modern medical resources compared to the secondary hospitals. In four administrative regions, the neurology services are better in more economically advanced regions. Conclusions Neurological care services need to be enhanced at the county-level hospitals to improve health care delivery.

ID KNOWLEDGE; TRIAL
AB Background In Ethiopia, cervical cancer is a public health concern, as it is the second most cause of cancer deaths among reproductive age women and it affects the country's most vulnerable groups like; rural, poor, and HIV-positive women. Despite the strong evidence that cervical cancer screening results in decreased mortality from this disease, its utilization remains low. Methods An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2 to April 1/2019 to assess the level and factors affecting utilization of cervical cancer screening among HIV positive women in Hawassa town. Quantitative data collection methods were used. Data were gathered using a structured and pretested questionnaire. Epi-Info version 7 and SPSS version 23 were used for data entry and analysis respectively. Statistically significant association of variables was determined based on Adjusted Odds ratio with its 95% confidence interval and p-value of <= 0.05. Results Of the 342 women interviewed, 40.1% (95% CI: 35.00, 45.33%) of them were screened. Having a post primary education (AOR = 5.1, 95% CI: 1.8, 14.5), less than 500 cell/mm3 CD4 count (AOR = 2.7, 95% CI: 1.2, 5.9); duration since HIV diagnosis (AOR = 4.2, 95% CI: 2.1, 8.5), partner support (AOR = 4.7, 95% CI: 2.3, 9.4), having knowledge about risk factors (AOR = 2.9 (95% CI: 1.2, 6.9) and having favorable attitude towards cervical cancer and its screening (AOR = 3.7 (95% CI: 1.8, 7.5) were associated with cervical cancer screening utilization. Conclusions The study revealed utilization of cervical cancer screening service was low among HIV positive women. Educational status, duration of HIV diagnosis, partner support, knowledge status about risk factor, CD4 count and attitude towards cervical cancer and its screening were associated with cervical cancer screening utilization. Health care workers need to provide intensive counseling services for all ART care attendants to increase utilization.

DE Tuberculosis; Patient-pathway analysis; Health system delay
ID NEW-YORK-CITY; PATHWAY ANALYSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; DIAGNOSIS;

AB Background The decline of the incidence rate of tuberculosis in Taiwan has been partly attributed to the launch of the directly observed therapy short course (DOTS) program in 2006, followed by the DOTS-Plus in 2007. However, with the phasing out of the specialized tuberculosis care system and the declining incidence, clinical workers in Taiwan might become less familiar with the presentation of tuberculosis. Complementing the patient-pathway analysis with health system delay estimates, the objective of this study is twofold: to estimate the alignment between patient care initiation and the availability of prompt diagnostic and treatment services, and to identify the risk factors of delayed tuberculosis treatment. Methods The study population included all Taiwanese patients with incident tuberculosis in 2013. We (1) identified 11,507 incident tuberculosis patients from the 2013 National TB Registry, and (2) linked 10,932 Taiwanese from the registry to the 2012-2013 National Health Insurance Research Database. We assessed patient's care-seeking pathways and associated the determinants of health system delay in a Cox model. Results The overall health system delay was 46 days. We found that 20.5 and 3.5% of 10,932 tuberculosis patients were diagnosed and treated respectively at the initial visit to seek care for TB-related symptoms. Risk factors related to the prolonged health system delay included female gender (adjusted HR = 0.921, 95% CI: 0.884, 0.960), age > =65 years (adjusted HR = 0.720, 95% CI: 0.692, 0.750), non-severe (chest X-ray without cavities) (adjusted HR =0.721, 95% CI 0.683-0.760), chronic respiratory diseases (adjusted HR = 0.544, 95% CI: 0.522, 0.566), living in long-term care facilities (adjusted HR = 0.580, 95% CI: 0.525,0.640), an initial visit at a primary care clinic (adjusted HR = 0.588, 95% CI: 0.565, 0.612), and living in southern Taiwan (adjusted HR = 0.887, 95% CI: 0.798, 0.987). Conclusions The low access to TB diagnostic and treatment services at the initial visit and the prolonged health system delay indicate inefficiency in the health care system. Strengthening training of physicians at public hospitals and health workers at nursing homes might improve the efficiency and timeliness of tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment in Taiwan.

Phenotypic novelty in flagellar genes arise predominately through accumulation of mutations but horizontal transfer is known to occur. A linear plasmid termed pBSSB1 previously identified in Salmonella Typhi, was found to encode a flagellar operon that can mediate phase variation, which results in the rare z66 flagella phenotype. The identification and tracking of homologs of pBSSB1 is limited because it falls outside the normal replicon typing schemes for plasmids. Here we report the generation of nine new pBSSB1-family sequences using Illumina and Nanopore sequence data. Homologs of pBSSB1 were identified in 154 genomes representing 25 distinct serotypes from 67,758 Salmonella public genomes. Pangenome analysis of pBSSB1-family contigs was performed using roary and we identified three core genes amenable to a minimal pMLST scheme. Population structure analysis based on the newly developed pMLST scheme identified three major lineages representing 35 sequence types, and the distribution of these sequence types was found to span multiple serovars across the globe. This in silico pMLST scheme has shown utility in tracking and subtyping pBSSB1-family plasmids and it has been incorporated into the plasmid MLST database under the name "pBSSB1-family".

AB Background Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been associated with certain types of oropharyngeal cancers and yet, the level of knowledge that dental professionals and the lay public have in terms of HPV transmission, oral sexual activities, and oral cancer development needs exploration. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge held by practicing dental professionals as well as the lay public regarding Human Papillomavirus (HPV) transmission through oral sex and subsequent oropharyngeal cancer development. Methods Textual data were collected from a public forum with dental professionals in. Vancouver, who discussed the HPV-oral sex-oral cancer triad, and from survey data gathered from 212 lay public participants (also in Vancouver) who answered a 13-item questionnaire on the perceived risks of oral sex in terms of HPV infection and oropharyngeal cancer development. The data were analyzed statistically by age group, gender, and sexual orientation using descriptive statistics, while an ANOVA test was used to compare variation in the responses to the survey (p-value = 0.05). Results The forum engaged 46 health care professionals, many of whom were aware of the potential risks for head and neck cancer development due to HPV infection, while also questioning "how to effectively talk about HPV with patients." The survey revealed that 34.5% of the participants believed that oral sex is an activity with no or low risk for the transmission of HPV, while 84% of participants believed the same sexual practices were of low or no-risk for HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) transmission. Most participants (82%) never discussed oral sexual activities with their physicians or dentists/dental hygienists. Conclusions The general public remains mostly unaware of the potential links between HPV infection and oropharyngeal cancer. Physicians and dental providers should discuss oral sexual practice with their patients to raise awareness.

AB Background Variation at different levels of diabetes care has not yet been quantified for low- and middle-income countries. Understanding this variation and its magnitude is important to guide policy makers in designing effective interventions. This study aims to quantify the variation in the control of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) for type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients at the clinic and patient level and determine patient and clinic factors associated with control of these outcomes in T2D. Methods This is a cross-sectional study within the baseline data from the impact evaluation of the Enhanced Primary Health Care (EnPHC) intervention on 40 public clinics in Malaysia. Patients aged 30 and above, diagnosed with T2D, had a clinic visit for T2D between 01 Nov 2016 and 30 April 2017 and had at least one HbA1c, SBP and LDL-C measurement within 1 year from the date of visit were included for analysis. Multilevel linear regression adjusting for patient and clinic characteristics was used to quantify variation at the clinic and patient levels for each outcome. Results Variation in intermediate clinical outcomes in T2D lies predominantly (93% and above) at the patient level. The strongest predictors for poor disease control in T2D were the proxy measures for disease severity including duration of diabetes, presence of microvascular complications, being on insulin therapy and number of antihypertensives. Among the three outcomes, HbA1c and LDL-C results provide greatest opportunity for improvement. Conclusion Clinic variation in HbA1c, SBP and LDL-C accounts for a small percentage from total variation. Findings from this study suggest that standardised interventions need to be applied across all clinics, with a focus on customizing therapy based on individual patient characteristics.

AB Background The opioid epidemic is a major public health issue associated with significant overdose deaths. Effective treatments exist, such as the medication buprenorphine, but are not widely available. This narrative review examines the attitudes of primary care providers (PCPs) toward prescribing buprenorphine. Methods Narrative review of 20 articles published after the year 2000, using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to organize the findings. Results Three of the five CFIR domains ("Intervention Characteristics," "Outer Setting," "Inner Setting") were strongly represented in our analysis. Providers were concerned about the clientele associated with buprenorphine, diversion, and their self-efficacy in prescribing the medication. Some believed that buprenorphine does not belong in the discipline of primary care. Other barriers included philosophical objections and stigma toward substance use disorders. Notably, two studies reported a shift in attitudes once physicians prescribed buprenorphine to actual patients. Conclusions Negative attitudes toward buprenorphine encompassed multi-layered concerns, ranging from skepticism about the medication itself, the behaviors of patients with opioid use disorders, and beliefs regarding substance use disorders more generally. We speculate, however, that negative attitudes may be improved by tailoring support strategies that address providers' self-efficacy and level of knowledge.

TI Moving into an urban drug scene among people who use drugs in Vancouver,
   Canada: Latent class growth analysis
SO PLOS ONE

   MOBILITY; VIOLENCE; HOTELS; IMPACT
AB Background
   Urban drug scenes are characterized by high prevalence of illicit drug dealing and use, violence and poverty, much of which is driven by the criminalization of people who use illicit drugs (PWUD) and the associated stigma. Despite significant public health needs, little is understood about patterns of moving into urban drug scenes among PWUD. Therefore, we sought to identify trajectories of residential mobility (hereafter `mobility') among PWUD into the Downtown Eastside (DTES), an urban neighbourhood with an open drug scene in Vancouver, Canada, as well as characterize distinct trajectory groups among PWUD.
   Methods
   Data were derived from three prospective cohort studies of community-recruited PWUD in Vancouver between 2005 and 2016. We used latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to identify distinct patterns of moving into the DTES among participants residing outside of DTES at baseline. Multivariable multinomial logistic regression was used to determine baseline factors associated with each trajectory group.
   Results
   In total, 906 eligible participants (30.9% females) provided 9,317 observations. The LCGA assigned four trajectories: consistently living outside of DTES (52.8%); early move into DTES (11.9%); gradual move into DTES (19.5%); and move in then out (15.8%). Younger PWUD, those of Indigenous ancestry, those who were homeless or living in a single-room occupancy hotel (SRO), and those injecting drugs daily were more likely to move in then out of DTES (all p<0.05). Living in an SRO, daily injection drug use, and recent incarceration were also positively associated with early mobility (all p<0.05).
   Conclusions
   Nearly half of the participants moved into the DTES. Younger PWUD and Indigenous peoples appeared to have particularly high mobility, as did those with markers of social-structural vulnerability and high intensity drug use. These findings indicate a need to tailor existing social and health services within the DTES and expand affordable housing options outside the DTES.

TI Molecular epidemiological characteristics of dengue virus carried by 34

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID OUTBREAK
AB Dengue fever is a major worldwide public health problem that, as estimated by the WHO, causes epidemics in over 100 countries, resulting in hundreds of millions of dengue virus (DENV) infections every year. In China, dengue fever mainly occurs in coastal areas. Recurring dengue outbreaks were reported by Guangdong Province almost every year since the first epidemic in 1978. DENV infections persisted in Guangzhou in consecutive years since 2000, with the dengue epidemic reaching a historical peak in 2014. Because Guangzhou is one of the largest cities for opening up in China, understanding the epidemiological characteristics of dengue fever in the city can hopefully provide a significant basis for developing effective dengue prevention strategies. In this study, a total of 34 DENV strains, including 29 DENV-1 strains and 5 DENV-2 strains, were isolated from a blood samples drawn from patients who were diagnosed with dengue fever by hospitals in Guangzhou during 2018. To explore the epidemiological characteristics of dengue fever, the envelope (E) gene obtained from the isolates was amplified for phylogenetic analysis. The results from the phylogenetic analysis showed that DENV in Guangzhou was mainly imported from Southeast Asian countries. Additionally, propagation paths based on phylogeographical analysis suggested potential local dengue transmission in Guangzhou.

   This model simulated five diagnostic strategies for LTBI in primary health care workers (HCW) in Brazil: tuberculin skin testing using >= 5 mm cut-off, tuberculin skin testing >= 10 mm cut-off, QuantiFERON (R)-TB Gold in-Tube, tuberculin skin testing using >= 5 mm cut-off confirmed by QuantiFERON (R)-TB Gold In-Tube if TST positive, tuberculin skin testing using >= 10 mm cut-off confirmed by QuantiFERON (R)-TB Gold In-Tube if TST positive.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures
   The outcome measures are the number of individuals correctly classified by the test and the number of Tuberculosis cases avoided.
   Results
   The most cost-effective strategy was the tuberculin skin test considering >= 10mm cut-off. The isolated use of the QuantiFERON (R)-TB Gold In-Tube revealed the strategy of lower efficiency with incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$ 146.05 for each HCW correctly classified by the test.
   Conclusions
   The tuberculin skin test using >= 10 mm cut-off was the most cost-effective strategy in the diagnosis of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in primary health care works in Brazil.

AB Multi-stakeholder platforms have become mainstream in projects, programmes and policy interventions aiming to improve innovation and livelihoods systems, i.e. research for development interventions in low- and middle-income contexts. However, the evidence for multistakeholder platforms' contribution to the performance of research for development interventions and their added value is not compelling. This paper focuses on stakeholder participation as one of the channels for multi-stakeholder platforms' contribution to the performance of research for development interventions, i.e. stakeholder participation. It uses a quantitative approach and utilizes descriptive statistics and ARIMA models. It shows that, in three Ugandan multi-stakeholder platform cases studied, participation increased both in nominal and in unique terms. Moreover, participation was rather cyclical and fluctuated during the implementation of the research for development interventions. The study also shows that, in addition to locational and intervention factors such as type of the area along a rural-urban gradient targeted by the intervention and human resources provided for multi-stakeholder platform implementation, temporal elements such as phases of research for development intervention objectives and the innovation development process play significant roles in influencing participation. The study concludes that contribution of multi-stakeholder platforms to the performance of research for development projects, programs, policies and other initiatives is constrained by locational and temporal context and conditional on the participation requirements of the objectives pursued by research for development intervention.

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID OFFSPRING OVERWEIGHT; EARLY ADULTHOOD; GUT MICROBIOTA; RISK;
   ADOLESCENCE; CHILDHOOD; CHILDREN; WEIGHT; MODE
AB Background
   Obesity is an important public health problem and rates have reached epidemic proportions in many countries. Studies have explored the association between infants delivered by caesarean section and their later life risk of obesity, in many countries outside Africa. As a result of the increasing caesarean section and obesity rates in South Africa, we investigated the association in this country.
   Methods
   This was a retrospective analysis of data that were collected from a prospective South African birth cohort (Birth to Twenty Plus), established in 1990. A total of 889 young adults aged 21-24 years were included in the analysis. Poisson regression models were fitted to assess the association between mode of delivery and early adulthood obesity.
   Results
   Of the 889 young adults, 106 (11.9%) were obese while 72 (8.1%) were delivered by caesarean section; of which 14 (19.4%) were obese. Caesarean section delivery was significantly associated with obesity in young adults after adjusting for potential confounders like young adults' sex and birth weight, mothers' parity, and education (incidence rate ratio 1.64, 95% CI 1.01-2.68, p = 0.045).
   Conclusion
   The association of caesarean section with early adulthood obesity should be interpreted with caution because data on certain key confounding factors such as mothers' pre-pregnancy body mass index and gestational diabetes were not available. Further research from Africa, with larger sample sizes and databases with useful linking of maternal and infant data, should be conducted.

   emotional intimate partner violence in Rwanda and South Africa

AB Emotional intimate partner violence (IPV) is extremely common and has significant health and social consequences, yet typically receives much less attention in research and programming than physical and sexual IPV. This limits our understanding of how women experience and understand emotional IPV in different settings, which is required to inform effective prevention and response. This paper draws on qualitative data collected in mixed-methods impact evaluations of two IPV prevention programmes conducted as part of the What Works to Prevent Violence Against Women and Girls Global Programme. In doing so, we seek to develop a more nuanced understanding of the forms, causes and consequences of emotional IPV in heterosexual relationships in two distinct African settings. We draw on two rounds of in-depth interviews conducted with 15 women in South Africa and three rounds of interviews conducted with 57 women and men in Rwanda, all of whom were participants in the programmes, around their experiences of and conceptualizations of emotional IPV. Thematic analysis around emotional IPV was conducted and compared across both data sets, informed by a cross comparative analysis approach. The analysis found that the categories or types of acts perceived as emotional IPV by women experienced were similar across settings. Women in both contexts described public humiliation, control of mobility, access to housing and silencing as important categories of actions experienced emotional IPV. These types of emotional IPV were underpinned by similar patterns of gender inequalities, with the intention for men to assert control and power over women. The specific acts through which these categories of emotional IPV manifested in the two settings arose from contextual differences related to the social structure of relationships and dominant social norms. This analysis highlights commonalities in the underlying categorial understanding of IPV in two distinct African settings, and well as the differences in specific manifestations which stem from the social context of relationships. In doing so, we highlight both broad categorical areas of IPV that may be important to address in future research and prevention programming, as well as affirming the need for information on context-specific manifestations of emotional IPV to inform local intervention programmes.

AB Background
   Sedentary behavior is a growing public health concern in young adolescents from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, a paucity of multinational studies, particularly in LMICs, have investigated correlates of leisure-time sedentary behavior (LTSB) in young adolescents. In the current study, we assessed socio-demographic, socio-economic, sociocultural and health behavior related correlates of LTSB among adolescents aged 12-15 years who participated in the Global school-based Student Health Survey (GSHS).
   Methods
   Self-reported LTSB, which was a composite variable assessing time spent sitting and watching television, playing computer games, talking with friends during a typical day excluding the hours spent sitting at school and doing homework, was analyzed in 181,793 adolescents from 66 LMICs [mean (SD) age 13.8 (1.0) years; 49% girls). Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the potential LTSB correlates.
   Results
   The overall prevalence of >= 3 hours/day of LTSB was 26.4% (95%CI = 25.6%-27.2%). Increasing age (OR = 1.14; 95%CI = 1.11-1.17), past 30-day smoking (OR = 1.85; 95%CI = 1.69-2.03), alcohol consumption (OR = 2.01; 95%CI = 1.85-2.18), and bullying victimization (OR = 1.39; 95%CI = 1.31-1.48) were positively associated with increased LTSB across the entire sample of 181,793 adolescents. Food insecurity (OR = 0.93; 95%CI = 0.89-0.97) and low parental support/monitoring (OR = 0.91; 95%CI = 0.85-0.98) were negatively associated with LTSB. There were some variations in the correlates between countries.
   Conclusions
   Our data indicate that in adolescents aged 12 to 15 years living in LMICs, LTSB is a complex and multi-dimensional behavior determined by socio-demograhic, sociocultural, socio-economic, and health behavior related factors. Future longitudinal data are required to confirm/refute these findings, and to inform interventions which aim to reduce sedentary levels in adolescents living in LMICs.

AB Background Only a paucity of large-scale perspective and cross-sectional studies on H. pylori infection in China have been published. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and risk factors for H. pylori infection among residents of Jidong community located in Hebei Province of China. Methods A perspective, cross-sectional study was conducted in Jidong community. Questionnaires and C-13-urea breath test were performed, and 10-ml blood samples were obtained for laboratory tests. Results Four thousand seven hundred ninety-six subjects were enrolled in this study, and 2506 (52.25%) were H. pylori positive. There was no difference in prevalence between both sexes (P = 0.5974). Age (P = 0.004) and education level (P = 0.0128) were significantly associated with H. pylori infection, and there were statistical trends in the prevalence across five age subgroups (chi(2) test for trend = 23.5; P < 0.001) and education levels (chi(2) test for trend = 19.50; P < 0.001). H. pylori infection was also associated with marital status (P = 0.0243), source of drinking water (P = 0.0433), frequency of eating raw garlic (P = 0.0310), alcohol drinking (P = 0.0207), knowledge about H. pylori transmission route (P = 0.0125) and related diseases (P = 0.0257). Age, alcohol drinking and knowledge about transmission route were found to be independent predictors of H. pylori infection. Conclusions More than half of the population was infected with H. pylori in Jidong community. The socio-demographic profiles, socio-economic factors and lifestyle are worthy taking into consideration to prevent diseases associated with H. pylori infection. Understanding the prevalence and risk patterns for H. pylori infection in China will help in prioritizing public health efforts to better manage the H. pylori infection.

AB Background Survivors of sexual violence, who are predominantly women, commonly access mental health services. Psychiatric inpatient units in Australia are predominately mixed gender and may further retraumatise these women. Sexual violence is under-recognised by mental health professionals and there is a lack of adequate policy or direction for mental health service services. To date, only a small amount of research has focused on health professionals' experiences of providing trauma-informed care to women in psychiatric settings, with most studies focused on specific practices or interventions. Qualitative data is particularly lacking on this topic. This is a critical gap in the knowledge given that health professionals are key to detecting and addressing victimisation. The aim of this study was to gain an in-depth understanding of healthcare professionals' experiences and perceptions in providing care to women who are survivors of sexual violence in psychiatric inpatient units. Methods This qualitative study utilised semi-structured interviews with 40 health professionals recruited from four psychiatric inpatient units within a large Australian public mental health organisation. Data were examined using thematic analysis. Results Three main typologies were developed to describe participants' experiences of the care provided to women; 1) Dismissing and denying; 2) Acknowledging but unprepared; 3) Empathising but despairing. Discussion Gender, professional training, adherence to the biomedical model, and level of experience influenced health professionals' experiences. Conclusions Health professionals in this study held varying attitudes towards female consumers and responses to sexual violence. Our findings suggest the need to address individual staff perception and promote trauma-informed and gender-sensitive care across all disciplines, genders, and levels of experience.

TI Processes for engaging and retaining women who are experiencing
   adversity in longitudinal health services research
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Quality improvement; Health services research; Vulnerable; Recruitment;
   Follow-up studies
AB Background Women and families experiencing socioeconomic and psychosocial adversity are the least likely to access health care but most likely to benefit. For health services to effectively meet the needs of individuals experiencing adversity, research involving the health services must be truly representative. However, individuals experiencing adversity are typically excluded from or underrepresented in health services research. This paper reports on the implementation of a quality improvement approach designed to support recruitment and retention of pregnant women experiencing adversity in a longitudinal, health services randomized controlled trial ("right@home"). Methods right@home recruited Australian women from 10 public maternity hospitals across the states of Victoria and Tasmania who were experiencing adversity (>= 2 risk factors on screening survey). Regular follow-up assessments were conducted by phone or face-to-face to child age 2 years. Research processes were designed taking heed of previous research demonstrating effective strategies for recruiting and retaining minority groups (e.g. piloting the recruitment process; recruiting via the health service providing care to the subgroup; remunerating participants); however, we were concerned that important information was missing. Therefore, once recruitment began, we conducted a continuous evaluation of the research processes, testing and implementing changes to processes or new strategies to maximize recruitment and retention (e.g. using a suite of strategies to maintain contact with families, using flexible data collection methods, obtaining consent for data linkage for future health and education data). Results right@home enrolled a large cohort of women (N = 722) experiencing high levels of adversity according to socioeconomic status and psychosocial risk factors, and achieved excellent retention (83% completion at 2 years). Most strategies appeared to increase recruitment and retention. All required additional time from the research team to develop and test, and some required extra funding, which ranged from minor (e.g. printing) to substantial (e.g. salaries, remuneration). Conclusions By taking a quality improvement approach, supported by sufficient resourcing and flexible research processes, it is possible to recruit and retain a large cohort of women experiencing adversity who are typically missed or lost from longitudinal research.

AB Background Intestinal parasitic infestations triggered considerable gastrointestinal morbidity, malnutrition, and mortality worldwide. In particular, young children in developing countries affected most. Helminthiasis infestation accounts for 10-20% of prevalence on preschool children worldwide. Unfortunately, small children below 5 years are uniquely susceptible to intestinal parasitic infestations in poor communities. This is because of children's behavior like playing with soil and putting hand -to- mouth habit. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and risk factors of intestinal parasitic infestations among preschool children in Sekota town, Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was carried out on 378 preschool children in Sekota town from February 15 - March 10/2019. Stool specimens were collected and examined for intestinal parasites using wet mount and formal ether concentration technique. The risk factors of intestinal parasites were assessed using a pretested structured questionnaire. The data were entered and analyzed using Epi-data version 4.2.0.0 and SPSS-version 23 statistical software respectively. Both bivariable and multivariable analysis was carried out, and potential co-linearity was tested for closely similar variables. Variables with P value less than 0.05 in multivariable analysis was considered as statistically significant and reported with 95% CI and odds ratio. Results The prevalence of intestinal parasitic infestations in Sekota town on wet mount and formal ether concentration techniques was 83(21.9%), (95% CI, 17.7-26.3%) and 113(29.9%), (95% CI, 25.1-34.8%) respectively. In multivariable analysis, not taking medication as periodical deworming (AOR, 95% CI), (2.5, 1.5-4.3), presence of animals in the living room (AOR, 95% CI) (3.1, 1.8-5.3), and being a government employee as an occupation (AOR, 95% CI), (3.4, 1.1-10.0) were increasing the odds of intestinal parasitic infestations. Conclusions The prevalence of intestinal parasitic infestations in Sekota town is high, which is a public health problem. The risk factors that contributed to intestinal parasitic infestations in this study were preventable and modifiable. Therefore, the concerned bodies need to emphasis on periodical deworming and keeping animals in separate room.

AB BackgroundImproving the rates of, and instruments used in, screening for perinatal depression and anxiety among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women are important public health priorities. The Kimberley Mum's Mood Scale (KMMS) was developed and later validated as an effective and acceptable perinatal depression and anxiety screening tool for the Kimberley region under research conditions. Other regions have expressed interest in using the KMMS with perinatal Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women. It is, however, important to re-evaluate the KMMS in a larger Kimberley sample via a real world implementation study, and to test for applicability in other remote and regional environments before recommendations for wider use can be made. This paper outlines the protocol for evaluating the process of implementation and establishing the 'real world' validity and acceptability of the KMMS in the Kimberley, Pilbara and Far North Queensland in northern Australia.MethodsThe study will use a range of quantitative and qualitative methods across all sites. KMMS validation/revalidation internal consistency of Part 1 will be determined using Cronbach's alpha. Equivalence for identifying risk of depression and anxiety compared to a standard reference assessment will be determined from receiver operating characteristic curves. Sensitivity and specificity will be determined based on these cut-points. Qualitative methods of phenomenology will be used to explore concepts of KMMS user acceptability (women and health professionals). Additional process evaluation methods will collate, assess and report on KMMS quality review data, consultations with health service administrators and management, field notes, and other documentation from the research team. This information will be reported on using the Dynamic Sustainability Framework.DiscussionThis project is contributing to the important public health priority of screening Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women for perinatal depression and anxiety with tools that are meaningful and responsive to cultural and clinical needs. Identifying and addressing barriers to implementation contributes to our understanding of the complexity of improving routine clinical practie.Trial registrationThe study was registered retrospectively on 15/05/2019 with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial registry (ACTRN12619000580178).

AB Background The use of computers/TV has become increasingly common worldwide after entering the twenty-first century and depression represents a growing public health burden. Understanding the association between screen time-based sedentary behavior (ST-SB) and the risk of depression is important to the development of prevention and intervention strategies. Methods We searched the electronic databases of Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library. The odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was adopted as the pooled measurement. Subgroup analyses were investigated by stratified meta-analyses based on age, gender and reference group (reference category of screen time, e.g. 2 h/day, 4 h/day). Results There were 12 cross-sectional studies and 7 longitudinal studies met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the pooled OR was 1.28 with high heterogeneity (I-2 = 89%). Compared to those who reported less SB, persons reporting more SB had a significantly higher risk of depression. When the gender was stratified, the pooled OR was 1.18 in female groups while no significant association was observed in males. Among the 19 studies, 5 studies used a reference group with ST = 2 h/days (pooled OR = 1.46), 9 studies used >= 4 h as a reference group (pooled OR = 1.38), 2 studies used 1 h as a reference group (pooled OR = 1.07) and for the remaining 3 studies, hours of ST were calculated as a continuous variable (pooled OR = 1.04). Conclusions ST-SB is associated with depression risk and the effects vary in different populations. In addition, valid objective measures of SB should be developed in future studies.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB Background In low-income countries, delays in treatment seeking among tuberculosis patients contribute to easy transmission and high prevalence of tuberculosis. Objective The aim of this study was to determine the magnitude of delays in treatment-seeking and risk factors among pulmonary tuberculosis suspected patients in health facilities located in Adama, Ethiopia. Method A health-facility based cross-sectional study was conducted at Adama from December 20, 2015, to March 1, 2016, among 598 tuberculosis suspected patients. Data was collected from all study participants on the same day of tuberculosis diagnosis using a structured questionnaire. Epi-Info 3.5.3 and Statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) version 16.0 were used for data entry and analysis respectively. A bivariate and multivariable regression model was used to investigate the association between delay in seeking-treatment and various factors. Odds ratio with 95% CI and P-value < 0.05 were considered as cut off point to measure the strength and significance of the association. Results Among 598 pulmonary tuberculosis suspected patients, 79 (13.2%) were smear-positive. Among smear-positive participants, 61(77.2%) delayed seeking treatment and 275 (46%) patients delayed seeking treatment for > 30 days. The following factors were significantly associated with a delay in seeking treatment: female sex OR = 1.57, 95% CI (1.14, 2.18), low monthly income OR = 1.45, 95% CI (1.05, 2.01), lack of knowledge regarding tuberculosis OR = 1.67, 95% CI (1.13, 2.48), and cure rate of tuberculosis OR = 1.836, 95% CI (1.25, 2.69). Conclusion Nearly half of pulmonary tuberculosis suspected patients delayed seeking treatment in our study area. Female sex, low income, family size of five and greater, no knowledge about tuberculosis and cure rate were factors contributing to delay in treatment-seeking among suspected tuberculosis patients.

AB BackgroundIn recent years, tuberculosis outbreaks in schools have occurred more frequently in China than in other parts of the world, and have posed a public health threat to students and their families. This systematic review aimed to understand the epidemiological characteristics of tuberculosis (TB) outbreaks and analyze the factors associated with TB outbreaks in schools in China.MethodsWe conducted this systematic review following the standard procedures of the Cochrane Collaboration and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis statement. The meta-analysis was performed with STATA using a random effects model.ResultsWe included 107 studies involving 1795 student patients with TB in mainland China. The results of the systematic analysis indicated that TB outbreaks were more frequently reported in senior middle schools and in Eastern China. The outbreaks mainly occurred during the winter and spring, and the median outbreak duration was 4months. The meta-analysis showed that the total attack rate and the class attack rate of tuberculosis outbreaks among students were 4.60% (95% CI 3.80 to 5.70%) and 22.70% (95% CI 19.20 to 27.00%), respectively. Subgroup analysis showed that outbreaks that occurred at universities or colleges had a relatively higher attack rate than those occurred in senior middle schools. The prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) among close contacts was 23.70% (95% CI 19.50 to 28.90%). The median case-finding interval was 2months, and 47.40% of the index cases had a case-finding delay.ConclusionThe results of our review indicated that school TB outbreaks were reported most frequently in senior middle schools in China. The attack rates of outbreaks at universities or colleges were higher than those in senior middle schools. The TB outbreaks in schools usually occurred over prolonged periods. The case-finding delay in the index cases must be reduced to prevent transmission in classes and schools. Effective surveillance and screening of presumptive TB cases in schools should be strengthened to reduce outbreaks in schools.

   PREVALENCE; MOTHERS; SCALE
AB Background
   Postpartum depression is a non-psychotic disorder that happens during the first 1year after childbirth. It affects both the mother's health and child's development and is given significant public health concern in developed countries. However, in developing countries including Ethiopia, postnatal care is mainly concerned with obstetric problems and the baby's health, while the psychological well-being of the mother is given little attention. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the magnitude and associated factors of postpartum depression among women in Nekemte town, East Wollega zone, West Ethiopia, 2019.
   Methods
   Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 295 postnatal women, from May 15 to June 5, 2019, in Nekemte town. The study participants were selected by a simple random sampling method and interviewed using structured questionnaires. Multivariable logistic regression was used to find the independent variables which are associated with postnatal depression. All associations between dependent and independent variables and statistical significance were measured using odds ratio at 95% confidence interval and p-value less than 0.05.
   Results
   From the total of 295 women sampled, 287 were participated in the study. Out of these 287 women participated, 20.9% had developed postnatal depression. Unplanned pregnancy (AOR = 7.84, 95% CI: 3.19, 19.26), Being first time mother (AOR = 4.99, 95% CI: 1.54, 16.09), History of previous depression (AOR = 3.06, 95% CI: 1.06, 8.82), Domestic violence (AOR = 5.92, 95% CI: 2.44, 14.40), History of substance use (AOR = 3.95, 95% CI: 1.52, 10.30) and poor social support (AOR = 6.59, 95% CI: 2.25, 19.29) were significantly associated with postnatal depression.
   Conclusion
   In this study, the magnitude of postnatal depression was found moderate compared to other studies. Perinatal depression screening and intervention need to be integrated with maternal health care services, especially for mothers at risk of postnatal depression.

TI Exploring local realities: Perceptions and experiences of healthcare
   workers on the management and control of drug-resistant tuberculosis in
   Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID TB; POVERTY
AB Background
   Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) remains a major health security threat worldwide. The effectiveness of implementation of DR-TB control strategies has been a subject of research and controversy. In resource-limited settings, using conventional medicine as the only framework to explain DR-TB gives a rather incomplete picture of the disease. This study intended to explore the perceptions and experiences of healthcare workers on the management and control of DR-TB in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
   Methods
   The study employed a qualitative methodology with an inductive approach and a thematic analysis. It involved in-depth interviews with healthcare workers providing clinical services to DR-TB patients in 10 public healthcare facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
   Results
   A total of 18 healthcare workers participated until data saturation, which included 12 clinical nurses, four health officers and two medical laboratory technicians. The findings show that healthcare workers perceive DR-TB as a growing public health threat in Ethiopia, due to factors such as poverty, poor nutrition, crowded settings, healthcare worker and general public awareness of DR-TB, lack of good governance and culture.
   Conclusion
   The perspectives drawn from the healthcare workers shed more light on the image of DR-TB in a developing country context. It has been shown that understanding DR-TB is not confined to what can be drawn from the sphere of biomedicine. There are also interconnected barriers, which predict a dystopia in the epidemiology of DR-TB. Bringing DR-TB under control requires taking a step back from an overwhelming focus on the biomedical facets of the disease, and employ critical thinking on the wider social and structural forces as equally important targets.

AB Introduction
   Multimorbidity associated with significant disease and economic burdens is common among the aged. We identified chronic disease multimorbidity patterns in Koreans 50 years of age or older, and explored whether such patterns were associated with particular sociodemographic factors and health-related quality-of-life.
   Methods
   The multimorbidity patterns of 10 chronic diseases (hypertension, dyslipidemia, stroke, osteoarthritis, tuberculosis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, depression, diabetes mellitus, and thyroid disease) were identified via latent class analysis of data on 8,370 Korean adults aged 50+ years who participated in the sixth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2013-2015). The associations between multimorbidity patterns, and sociodemographic factors and health-related quality of life, were subjected to regression analysis.
   Results
   Three patterns of multimorbidity were identified: 1) a relatively healthy group (60.4% of the population); 2) a 'cardiometabolic conditions' group (27.8%); and, 3) an 'arthritis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, depression, and thyroid disease' group (11.8%). The female (compared to male) gender was associated with an increased likelihood of membership of the cardiometabolic conditions group (odds ratio [OR] = 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15-1.51) and (to a much greater extent) the arthritis, asthma, allergy, depression, and thyroid disease group (OR = 4.32, 95% CI = 3.30-5.66). Low socioeconomic status was associated with membership of the two multimorbidity classes. Membership of the arthritis, asthma, allergy, depression, and thyroid disease group was associated with a significantly poorer health-related quality-of-life than was membership of the other two groups.
   Conclusion
   The co-occurrence of chronic diseases was not attributable to chance. Multimorbidity patterns were associated with sociodemographic factors and quality-of-life. Our results suggest that targeted, integrated public health and clinical strategies dealing with chronic diseases should be based on an understanding of multimorbidity patterns; this would improve the quality-of-life of vulnerable multimorbid adults.

AB Background Intestinal parasitic infestations triggered considerable gastrointestinal morbidity, malnutrition, and mortality worldwide. In particular, young children in developing countries affected most. Helminthiasis infestation accounts for 10-20% of prevalence on preschool children worldwide. Unfortunately, small children below 5 years are uniquely susceptible to intestinal parasitic infestations in poor communities. This is because of children's behavior like playing with soil and putting hand -to- mouth habit. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and risk factors of intestinal parasitic infestations among preschool children in Sekota town, Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was carried out on 378 preschool children in Sekota town from February 15 - March 10/2019. Stool specimens were collected and examined for intestinal parasites using wet mount and formal ether concentration technique. The risk factors of intestinal parasites were assessed using a pretested structured questionnaire. The data were entered and analyzed using Epi-data version 4.2.0.0 and SPSS-version 23 statistical software respectively. Both bivariable and multivariable analysis was carried out, and potential co-linearity was tested for closely similar variables. Variables with P value less than 0.05 in multivariable analysis was considered as statistically significant and reported with 95% CI and odds ratio. Results The prevalence of intestinal parasitic infestations in Sekota town on wet mount and formal ether concentration techniques was 83(21.9%), (95% CI, 17.7-26.3%) and 113(29.9%), (95% CI, 25.1-34.8%) respectively. In multivariable analysis, not taking medication as periodical deworming (AOR, 95% CI), (2.5, 1.5-4.3), presence of animals in the living room (AOR, 95% CI) (3.1, 1.8-5.3), and being a government employee as an occupation (AOR, 95% CI), (3.4, 1.1-10.0) were increasing the odds of intestinal parasitic infestations. Conclusions The prevalence of intestinal parasitic infestations in Sekota town is high, which is a public health problem. The risk factors that contributed to intestinal parasitic infestations in this study were preventable and modifiable. Therefore, the concerned bodies need to emphasis on periodical deworming and keeping animals in separate room.

AB Background Children and young people make up an age group most vulnerable to falls. Various stability disorders may become instrumental in sustaining more frequent falls and resultant fractures. Correct morphological structure impacts overall efficiency of the foot, as well as offers significant diagnostic potential. Even minor foot disorders may affect the entire bio kinematic chain, also impacting the foot's motility. Structural alterations within a foot may also impair balance in the standing position, and contribute to more frequent injuries. The study aimed to assess the relationship between feet deformities and postural stability deficits in schoolchildren prone to sustain accidental falls. Methods The study involved 200 children (101 girls and 99 boys) aged 10-15 years, randomly selected from primary schools. A 2D podoscan was used to assess the plantar part of the foot, while stabilometric examination was aided by the FreeMed dynamometric platform. Results Correlation between respective variables was reflected by Spearman's rank coefficient. The subjects' age negatively correlated with the COP range of movement along the Y axis, and the COP surface area, while their BMI negatively correlated with the COP trajectory's length. Step regression analysis indicated that the width of the left foot, the left foot Wejsflog index, the left foot Clark's angle, the hallux valgus angle were the essential predictors of stabilometric variables in girls. In boys, though, predictive value was associated with Clarke's angle of the left and right foot, Wejsflog index of the right foot, and the width of both the left and right foot. Conclusions There is a statistically significant correlation between morphological variables of the foot and postural stability. When assessing the key variables of the foot and their interrelationship with postural stability, the Clarke's angle, Wejsflog index, hallux valgus angle, and foot width, should be granted due prominence in the girls. As regards the boys, the following variables were established as predictive in assessing postural stability: Clarke's angle, Wejsflog index, and foot width.

AB Background Recent reports of the National Ministry of Health and Treatment of Iran (NMHT) show that Gilan has a higher annual incidence rate of leptospirosis than other provinces across the country. Despite several efforts of the government and NMHT to eradicate leptospirosis, it remains a public health problem in this province. Modelling and Prediction of this disease may play an important role in reduction of the prevalence. Methods This study aims to model and predict the spatial distribution of leptospirosis utilizing Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as capable approaches. Five environmental parameters of precipitation, temperature, humidity, elevation and vegetation are used for modelling and predicting of the disease. Data of 2009 and 2010 are used for training, and 2011 for testing and evaluating the models. Results Results indicate that utilized approaches in this study can model and predict leptospirosis with high significance level. To evaluate the efficiency of the approaches, MSE (GWR = 0.050, SVM = 0.137, GLM = 0.118 and ANN = 0.137), MAE (0.012, 0.063, 0.052 and 0.063), MRE (0.011, 0.018, 0.017 and 0.018) and R-2 (0.85, 0.80, 0.78 and 0.75) are used. Conclusion Results indicate the practical usefulness of approaches for spatial modelling and predicting leptospirosis. The efficiency of models is as follow: GWR > SVM > GLM > ANN. In addition, temperature and humidity are investigated as the most influential parameters. Moreover, the suitable habitat of leptospirosis is mostly within the central rural districts of the province.

AB Culex quinquefasciatus Say is an opportunistic blood feeder with a wide geographic distribution which is also a major vector for a range of diseases of both animals and humans. CRISPR/Cas technologies have been applied to a wide variety of organisms for both applied and basic research purposes. CRISPR/Cas methods open new possibilities for genetic research in non-model organisms of public health importance. In this work we have adapted microinjection techniques commonly used in other mosquito species to Culex quinquefasciatus, and have shown these to be effective at generating homozygous knock-out mutations of a target gene in one generation. This is the first description of the kmo gene and mutant phenotype in this species.

AB Background
   This study explores trends in the prevalence of high sitting time and its correlates among "high sitting" and "high sitting-least active" European adults from 2002 to 2017. Both groups have merit for future public health interventions to prevent development of a range of prevalent non-communicable diseases.
   Methods
   Data collected in the 2002 (15 countries), 2005 (30 countries), 2013 (28 countries) and 2017 (28 countries) Eurobarometer surveys were used, including around 15,000 respondents in 2002 and > 26,000 respondents in the other years. Sitting time and moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity were measured with the validated International Physical Activity Questionnaire-short. High sitting was defined as > 7.5 hours per day. Respondents in the lowest quartile of total reported days of physical activity (i.e. days walking, days in moderate activity, and days in vigorous activity) were defined as least active. Multivariate odds ratios of high sitting, and high sitting-least active were assessed by country and socio-demographic characteristics for each survey year using binary logistic regression analyses.
   Results
   Trends in sitting time were relatively stable over a 15-year period, although this time trend was limited by a change in the sitting question between 2005 and 2013. Men, higher educated people, students, retired people, white collar workers, people living in urban areas, people with lower physical activity levels, and people living in the Czech Republic, Denmark or the Netherlands were consistently more likely to be in the high sitting group across all four survey years. Similarly, men, students, retired people, unemployed people, white collar workers, and people living in the Czech Republic or Denmark were consistently more likely to be in the high sitting-least active group across all four surveys.
   Conclusion
   This study identified population sub-groups that need special attention in public health interventions to lower total sitting time.

AB Background: Despite public funding of midwifery care, people of low-socioeconomic status are less likely to access midwifery care in Ontario, Canada, but little is known about barriers that they experience in accessing midwifery care. The purpose of this study was to examine the barriers and facilitators to accessing midwifery care experienced by people of low-socioeconomic status.
   Methods: A qualitative descriptive study design was used. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 pregnant and post-partum people of low-socioeconomic status in Hamilton, Ontario from January to May 2018. Transcribed interviews were coded using open coding techniques and thematically analyzed.
   Results: We interviewed 13 midwifery care recipients and 17 participants who had never received care from midwives. Four themes arose from the interviews: "I had no idea.", "Babies are born in hospitals", "Physicians as gateways into prenatal care", and "Why change a good thing?". Participants who had not experienced midwifery care had minimal knowledge of midwifery and often had misconceptions about midwives' scope of practice and education. Prevailing beliefs about pregnancy and birth, particularly concerns about safety, drove participants to seek care from a physician. Physicians are the entry point into the health care system for many, yet few participants received information about midwifery care from physicians. Participants who had experienced midwifery care found it to be an appropriate match for the needs of people of low socioeconomic status. Word of mouth was a primary source of information about midwifery and the most common reason for people unfamiliar with midwifery to seek midwifery care.
   Conclusions: Access to midwifery care is constrained for people of low-socioeconomic status because lack of awareness about midwifery limits the approachability of these services, and because information about midwifery care is often not provided by physicians when pregnant people first contact the health care system. For people of low-socioeconomic status, inequitable access to midwifery care may be exacerbated by lack of knowledge about midwifery within social networks and a tendency to move passively through the health care system which traditionally favours physician care. Targeted efforts to address this issue are necessary to reduce disparities in access to midwifery care.

AB Background Evaluating hospital efficiency is a process to optimize resource utilization and allocation. This is vital due to hospitals being the largest financial cost in a health system. To limit avoidable uses of hospital resources, it is important to identify the sources of hospital inefficiencies and to put in place measures towards their reduction and elimination. Thus, the purpose of this research is to examine the sources of hospital inefficiency in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, and existing strategies tackling this issue. Methods In this study, the electronic databases MEDLINE (via PubMed), Web of Science, Embase, Google, Google Scholar, and reference lists of selected articles, were explored. Studies on inefficiency, sources of inefficiency, and strategies for inefficiency reduction in the Eastern Mediterranean region hospitals, published between January 1999 and May 2018, were identified. A total of 1466 articles were selected using the initial criteria. After further reviews based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 56 studies were eligible for this study. The chosen studies were conducted in Iran (n = 35), Saudi Arabia (n = 5), Tunisia (n = 5), Jordan (n = 4), Pakistan (n = 2), the United Arab Emirates, Palestine, Iraq, Oman, and Afghanistan (n = 1 each). These studies were analyzed using content analysis in MAXQDA 10. Results The analysis showed that approximately 41% of studies used data envelopment analysis (DEA) to measure hospital efficiency. Sources of hospital inefficiency were divided into four categories for analysis: Hospital products and services, hospital workforce, hospital services delivery, and hospital system leakages. Conclusion This study has revealed some sources of inefficiency in the Eastern Mediterranean Region hospitals. Inefficiencies are thought to originate from excess workforce, excess beds, inappropriate hospital sizes, inappropriate workforce composition, lack of workforce motivation, and inefficient use of health system inputs. It is suggested that health policymakers and managers use this evidence to develop appropriate strategies towards the reduction of hospital inefficiency.

AB Background Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a serious infectious disease, which has become a public health problem. Previous studies have shown that temperature may influence the incidence of HFMD, but most only focus on single city and the results are highly heterogeneous. Therefore, a multicity study was conducted to explore the association between temperature and HFMD in different cities and search for modifiers that influence the heterogeneity. Methods We collected daily cases of childhood HFMD (aged 0-5 years) and meteorological factors of 21 cities in Guangdong Province in the period of 2010-2013. Distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) with quasi-Poisson was adopted to quantify the effects of temperature on HFMD in 21 cities. Then the effects of each city were pooled by multivariate meta-analysis to obtain the heterogeneity among 21 cities. Potential city-level factors were included in meta-regression to explore effect modifiers. Results A total of 1,048,574 childhood cases were included in this study. There was a great correlation between daily childhood HFMD cases and temperature in each city, which was non-linear and lagged. High heterogeneity was showed in the associations between temperature and HFMD in 21 cities. The pooled temperature-HFMD association was peaking at the 79th percentile of temperature with relative risk (RR) of 2.474(95% CI: 2.065-2.965) as compared to the median temperature. Latitude was the main modifier for reducing the heterogeneity to 69.28% revealed by meta-analysis. Conclusions There was a strong non-linear and lagged correlation between temperature and HFMD. Latitude was strongly associated with the relationship between temperature and HFMD. Meanwhile, it had an effect on modifying the relationship. These findings can conducive to local governments developing corresponding preventive measures.

AB Background Interest in mHealth interventions, defined as the use of mobile phones to access healthcare is increasingly becoming popular globally. Given its technology-based applications, university students may be key clients of the mHealth adoption but studies are rare in sub-Saharan Africa. This study provides a snapshot and baseline evidence on knowledge, attitude and use of mHealth among university students in Ghana. Methods Using a self-administered questionnaire, we collected data between April and June 2017 from 963 randomly sampled undergraduate students at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST). Pearson's Chi-square (chi(2)) test assessed the differences between variables whilst logistic regression models estimated the independent predictors of use of mHealth with p < 0.05 as significant. Results Knowledge on mHealth was moderately high. Specifically, more than half of the sample reported awareness of mHealth although the prevalence of use of mHealth stood at 51%. Logistic regressions revealed that mHealth use was positively associated with respondents' year (second year: OR = 1.704, 95% CI: 1.185-2.452, and third year: OR = 1.528, 95% CI: 1.060-2.202), and monthly income (OR:3.112, 95%CI: 1.180-8.211). However, ethnicity [(OR = 0.761, 95% CI (0.580-0.997)] was negatively associated with the use of mHealth technology. Conclusion Findings suggest that knowledge of mHealth among university students is low. Policy and public health interventions for urgent awareness creation and promotion of use of mHealth as well as its possible integration into the mainstream healthcare system in Ghana are timely.

AB Background Educational inequalities in health have been widely reported. A low educational level is associated with more adverse working conditions. Working conditions, in turn, are associated with health and there is evidence that this association remains after work exit. Because many countries are raising the statutory retirement age, lower educated workers have to spend more years working under adverse conditions. Therefore, educational health inequalities may increase in the future. This study examined (1) whether there were educational differences over time in health after work exit and (2) whether work characteristics mediate these educational inequalities in health. Methods Data from five prospective cohort studies were used: The Netherlands (Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam), Denmark (Danish Longitudinal Study of Aging), England (English Longitudinal Study of Ageing), Germany (German Aging Study), and Finland (Finnish Longitudinal Study on Municipal Employees). In each dataset we used Generalized Estimating Equations to examine the relationship between education and self-rated health after work exit with a maximum follow-up of 15 years and possible mediation of work characteristics, including physical demands, psychosocial demands, autonomy, and variation in activities. Results The low educated reported significantly poorer health after work exit than the higher educated. Lower educated workers had a higher risk of high physical demands and a lower risk of high psychosocial demands, high variation in tasks, and high autonomy at work, compared to higher educated workers. These work characteristics were found to be mediators of the relationship between education and health after work exit, consistent across countries. Conclusion Educational inequalities in health are still present after work exit. If workers are to spend an extended part of their lives at work due to an increase in the statutory retirement age, these health inequalities may increase. Improving working conditions will likely reduce these inequalities in health.

AB Background Discrimination is a major driver of health disparities among minority groups and can impede the reach of public health programs. In the Dominican Republic, residents of bateyes, or agricultural 'company towns,' often face barriers to health care. This study examined the extent of perceived discrimination among batey populations and places the findings within the context of disease elimination efforts. Methods In March-April 2016, a stratified, multi-stage cluster survey that included the 9-item Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS) was conducted among residents (n = 768) of bateyes across the Dominican Republic. Exploratory factor analysis, differential item functioning, and linear and logistic regression were used to assess associations between EDS scores, ethnic group status, reasons for discrimination, and healthcare-seeking behavior. Results Three ethnic groups were identified in the population: Haitian-born persons (42.5%), Dominican-born persons with Haitian descent (25.5%), and Dominican-born persons without Haitian descent (32.0%). Mean EDS scores (range 0-45) were highest among persons born in Haiti (18.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 16.4-20.1), followed by persons with Haitian descent (16.5, 95% CI = 14.9-18.0), and those without Haitian descent (13.3, 95% CI = 12.1-14.5). Higher EDS scores were significantly associated with Haitian birth (beta = 6.8, 95% CI = 4.2-9.4; p < 0.001) and Haitian descent (beta = 6.1, 95% CI = 3.2-9.0; p < 0.001). Most respondents (71.5%) had scores high enough to elicit reasons for their discrimination. Regardless of ethnic group, poverty was a common reason for discrimination, but Haitian-born and Haitian-descended people also attributed discrimination to their origin, documentation status, or skin color. EDS scores were not significantly associated with differences in reported care-seeking for recent fever (beta = 1.7, 95% CI = - 1.4-4.9; p = 0.278). Conclusion Perceived discrimination is common among batey residents of all backgrounds but highest among Haitian-born people. Discrimination did not appear to be a primary barrier to care-seeking, suggesting other explanations for reduced care-seeking among Haitian populations. Public health community engagement strategies should avoid exacerbating stigma, build active participation in programs, and work towards community ownership of disease control and elimination goals.

AB Background Cervical cancer was the fourth most common cancer among women worldwide in 2012 and was the eighth most common cancer in 2014 and the eighth greatest cause of female cancer deaths in Hong Kong in 2015. Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination has been clinically documented to have a high efficacy in reducing HPV-related cervical intraepithelial neoplasia incidence. Therefore, receiving vaccination is a crucial public health measure to reduce disease burden. Significant others, such as schools and schoolteachers, have prominent influence in shaping adolescents' health perceptions and behavior. Therefore, the perspective of schools and schoolteachers regarding vaccination can significantly influence students' acceptance and accessibility of the vaccine. However, few studies have analyzed the perceptions of schoolteachers toward HPV vaccination, and even fewer have concerned how schoolteachers' perceptions influence their schools' motivation in implementing school-based HPV vaccination programs. This study was thus conducted to fill this literature gap. Methods With a Chinese community as the field site of this study, a qualitative approach of five focus group interviews was conducted with 35 schoolteachers from five primary and eight secondary schools in Hong Kong between July 2014 and January 2015. Thematic content analysis was used for data analysis. Results Perceptual, institutional, student and parental, and collaborator barriers interacted to discourage the sampled schoolteachers from organizing school-based HPV vaccination programs. Lack of knowledge regarding HPV vaccination, perception of HPV vaccination as inappropriate given the students' age, violation of traditional cultural values, lack of perceived needs and perceived risk, opposition from schools, low priority of HPV vaccination over other health education topics, lack of government support, lack of interest from parents and students, and lack of confidence in implementing organizations, all were the mentioned barriers. Conclusions The sampled schoolteachers were demotivated to organize school-based HPV vaccination programs because of their perceptions and various social and cultural factors. As significant influencers of adolescent students, schoolteachers and schools should receive more support and information on organizing school-based HPV vaccination programs in the future.

AB Background Due to the high prevalence and adverse consequences, overweight and obesity in children continues to be a major public health concern worldwide. Socioeconomic background and health-related behaviours (such as diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviors) are important factors associated with weight status in children. Using a series of height and weight assessments from the Australian Capital Territory Physical Activity and Nutrition Survey (ACTPANS), trends in prevalence of overweight and obesity by socioeconomic status were examined in ACT Year 6 school children between 2006 and 2018. Methods The ACTPANS has been conducted every 3 years since 2006. A total of 6729 children were surveyed. Complete data on height and weight were available for 6384 (94.9%) participants. Trends in the prevalence of overweight and obesity and associations between weight status and risk factors (such as socioeconomic status, physical activity, screen time and consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks (SSD)) were examined using logistic regression. Results The prevalence of overweight and obesity remained stable in girls (from 22.5% in 2006 to 21.6% in 2018) but declined in boys (from 27.8 to 17.9%). During the same period, levels of physical activity increased slightly, while screen time and the consumption of fast food and SSD decreased. Socioeconomic gradient, based on the school-level Index of Community Socio-Educational Advantage (ICSEA), was highly associated with prevalence of overweight and obesity. Since 2006, the estimated prevalence of overweight and obesity has remained high in the lowest SES groups, but a concurrent downward trend was observed in the highest SES group, leading to increasing disparity between SES groups. Children in the lowest ICSEA quintile were more likely to be overweight or obese compared to those in the moderate and highest ICSEA quintiles. Children in lower ICSEA quintiles also reported lower levels of physical activity, higher levels of screen time, and higher levels of fast food and SSD consumption compared to those in higher ICSEA quintiles. Conclusions While recent trends in overweight and obesity in ACT children are encouraging, the prevalence remains unacceptably high, especially in those from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Additional prevention efforts are required to address the socioeconomic disparity.

AB Background Dental caries is a biofilm-diet-dependent worldwide public health problem, and approaches against microorganisms in cariogenic biofilms are necessary. Methods The antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of 12 Casearia sylvestris extracts (0.50 mg/mL) from different Brazilian biomes (Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, Caatinga, Pampa, and Pantanal) and varieties (sylvestris, lingua, and intermediate) were tested against two species found in cariogenic biofilms (Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans). The extracts effective against S. mutans were used to evaluate the "adhesion strength" of this bacterium to the salivary pellicle and initial glucan matrix and the S. mutans-GtfB activity. Also, the antimicrobial activity against S. mutans of three fractions (methanol, ethyl acetate, and hexane; 0.25 mg/mL) from the extracts was evaluated. Results Three extracts from the Atlantic Forest variety sylvestris (FLO/SC, GUA/CE, PRE/SP) reduced >= 50% (> 3 logs) S. mutans viable population (p < 0.0001 vs. vehicle), while two extracts from the same biome and variety (PAC/CE, PRE/SP) decreased >= 50% of the viable counts of C. albicans (p < 0.0001 vs. vehicle). For S. mutans biofilms, three extracts (GUA/CE, PAC/CE, PRE/SP) reduced the biomass by >= 91% (p > 0.0001 vs. vehicle) and 100% of the microbial population (p < 0.0001 vs. vehicle). However, for the fungal biofilm, two extracts (PAC/CE, PRE/SP) reduced the viable counts by >= 52% (p < 0.0001 vs. vehicle), but none reduced biomass. The extracts with higher antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities presented higher content of clerodane-type diterpenes and lower content of glycosylated flavonoids than the less active extracts. The extracts had no effect on the removal of cells adhered to the pellicle (p > 0.05 vs. vehicle) while promoted the detachment of a larger number of S. mutans cells from GtfB-glucan matrix (p < 0.0031 vs. vehicle), and FLO/SC, GUA/CE and PRE/SP reduced the quantity of glucans (p < 0.0136 vs. vehicle). Only the ethyl acetate fractions reduced the microbial population of S. mutans (p < 0.0001 vs. vehicle), except for one (PAC/CE). Among the ethyl acetate fractions, three from var. lingua (two from Cerrado, and one from Cerrado/Caatinga) reduced >= 83% of the microbial population. Conclusions C. sylvestris extracts from Atlantic Forest var. sylvestris and ethyl acetate fractions from Cerrado and Cerrado/Caatinga var. lingua may be used as a strategy against cariogenic microorganisms.

AB Background As health behavior varies with increasing age, we aimed to examine the potential barriers in calling emergency medical services (EMS) after recognizing a stroke among 40-74- and 75-99-year-old adults. Methods Data were obtained from a cross-sectional community-based study (FAST-RIGHT) that was conducted from January 2017 to May 2017 and involved adults (age >= 40 years) across 69 administrative areas in China. A subgroup of residents (153675) who recognized stroke symptoms was analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression models were performed in the 40-74 and 75-99 age groups, separately, to determine the factors associated with wait-and-see behaviors at the onset of a stroke. Results In the 40-74 and 75-99 age groups, the rates of participants who chose "Self-observation at home" were 3.0% (3912) and 3.5% (738), respectively; the rates of "Wait for family, then go to hospital" were 31.7% (42071) and 33.1% (6957), respectively. Rural residence, living with one's spouse, low income (< 731 US $ per annum), having a single avenue to learn about stroke, and having friends with stroke were factors associated with waiting for one's family in both groups. However, unlike in the 40-74 age group, sex, number of children, family history, and stroke history did not influence the behaviors at stroke onset in the 75-99 age group. Conclusions Different barriers from recognizing stroke and calling an ambulance exist in the 40-74 and 75-99 age groups in this specific population. Different strategies that mainly focus on changing the "Wait for family" behavior and emphasize on immediately calling EMS are recommended for both age groups.

AB Background
   Musculoskeletal pain conditions incur high costs and produce significant personal and public health consequences, including disability and opioid-related mortality. Persistence of high-cost health care utilization for musculoskeletal pain may help identify system inefficiencies that could limit value of care. The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with persistent high-cost utilization among individuals seeking health care for musculoskeletal pain.
   Methods
   This was a retrospective cohort study of Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data (2008-2013) that included a non-institutionalized, population-based sample of individuals seeking health care for a musculoskeletal pain condition (n = 12,985). Expenditures associated with musculoskeletal pain conditions over two consecutive years were analyzed from prescribed medicine, office-based medical provider visits, outpatient department visits, emergency room visits, inpatient hospital stays, and home health visits. Persistent high-cost utilization was defined as being in the top 15th percentile for annual musculoskeletal pain-related expenditures over 2 consecutive years. We used multinomial regression to determine which modifiable and non-modifiable sociodemographic, health, and pain-related variables were associated with persistent high-cost utilization.
   Results
   Approximately 35% of direct costs for musculoskeletal pain were concentrated among the 4% defined as persistent high-cost utilizers. Non-modifiable variables associated with expenditure group classification included age, race, poverty level, geographic region, insurance status, diagnosis type and total number of musculoskeletal pain diagnoses. Modifiable variables associated with increased risk of high expenditure classification were higher number of missed work days, greater pain interference, and higher use of prescription medication for pain, while higher self-reported physical and mental health were associated with lower risk of high expenditure classification.
   Conclusions
   Health care delivery models that prospectively identify these potentially modifiable factors may improve the costs and value of care for individuals with musculoskeletal pain prone to risk for high-cost care episodes.

TI Determinants of preterm birth among mothers who gave birth at public
   hospitals in the Amhara region, Ethiopia: A case-control study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   Preterm birth (PTB) is a public health issue worldwide. In developing nations, like Ethiopia, PTB is under reported and underestimated. However, it is the leading cause of neonatal and under-five mortality in Ethiopia. Besides, limited and non-comparative research studies to date has been conducted in the country to address the prevalence of PTB. Therefore, this study aims to determine predictors of PTB.
   Methods
   Hospital-based unmatched case control study was employed on a sample of 139 cases and 278 controls from October 2017 to December 2017 in the Amhara region, Ethiopia. The cases and controls were proportionally allocated in each hospital based on the last one-year case flows. As soon as a case was identified, the respective two controls were enrolled until the required sample size was satisfied. The outcome variable was measured by using either last menstrual period (LMP), early ultrasound result, or Ballard maturity examination. Face-to-face interviews were conducted using a standardized, structured, and pre-tested questionnaire to collect data. The collected data was entered into Epi-data and exported into SPSS for analysis. Independent variables with p-values < 0.25 in the bivariate analysis were entered into multivariable logistic regression models with forward logistic regressions method to control the influence of covariates. Ethical clearance was ensured.
   Results
   A total of 134 cases and 268 controls participated with a response rate of 96.4%. After adjusting for covariates, the following variables were associated with PTB: residing in rural areas [AOR = 2.99: 95% CI 1.19, 7.48], low maternal age [AOR = 3.47: 95% CI 1.11, 10.83], being illiterate [AOR = 4.56: 95% CI 1.11,8.62], short birth spacing [AOR = 2.48: 95% CI 1.07, 5.75], no antenatal care visits for this index pregnancy [AOR = 10.78: 95% CI 4.43, 26.25], having a history of previous adverse birth outcomes [AOR = 3.47: 95% CI 1.51, 8.02], and exposure to medical problems during pregnancy [AOR = 13.94: 95% CI 4.39, 24.27].
   Conclusion
   The study revealed maternal sociodemographic factors, short birth space, lack of antenatal care, exposure to previous adverse birth outcomes and facing medical illnesses during pregnancy were the predictors of PTB. Therefore, inclusive preventive and control interventions should be developed at regional, zonal and district levels to reduce the burden of PTB among women resided in rural areas such as integrating antenatal care services into the existing health extension packages. Study results suggest increasing the awareness of PTB, contraceptive utilization and counseling to enhance birth spacing, antenatal care visits, and accessibility to services among women in Ethiopia should be given due attention. Health care providers should focus on mothers with previous adverse birth outcomes and those exposed to medical problems during pregnancy. Additional community based longitudinal studies supplemented with qualitative methods are recommended.

AB Background Although evidence is accumulating that lifestyle modification may be cost-effective in patients with prediabetes, information is limited on the cost-effectiveness of interventions implemented in public health and primary health care settings. Evidence from well-conducted pragmatic trials is needed to gain insight into the realistic cost-effectiveness of diabetes prevention interventions in real-world settings. The aim of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of the SLIMMER lifestyle intervention targeted at patients at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with usual health care in a primary care setting in the Netherlands. Methods Three hundred and sixteen high-risk subjects were randomly assigned to the SLIMMER lifestyle intervention or to usual health care. Costs and outcome assessments were performed at the end of the intervention (12 months) and six months thereafter (18 months). Costs were assessed from a societal perspective. Patients completed questionnaires to assess health care utilisation, participant out-of-pocket costs, and productivity losses. Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) were calculated based on the SF-36 questionnaire. Cost-effectiveness planes and acceptability curves were generated using bootstrap analyses. Results The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that the incremental costs of the SLIMMER lifestyle intervention were euro547 and that the incremental effect was 0.02 QALY, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro28,094/QALY. When cost-effectiveness was calculated from a health care perspective, the ICER decreased to euro13,605/QALY, with a moderate probability of being cost-effective (56% at a willingness to pay, WTP, of euro20,000/QALY and 81% at a WTP of euro80,000/QALY). Conclusions The SLIMMER lifestyle intervention to prevent type 2 diabetes had a low to moderate probability of being cost-effective, depending on the perspective taken.

AB Background Condomless anal intercourse (CAI) appears to be increasing among men who have sex with men (MSM) globally, and is reported to be as high as 70% in recent studies in Peru. To improve understanding of the evolving context of CAI among MSM in Peru, we studied associations between partner type, substance use, and condomless anal intercourse (CAI) in locations where MSM commonly report having sexual encounters. Methods In a 2017 cross-sectional study of rectal STI screening and HIV prevention, a convenience sample of MSM recruited from community venues in Lima completed a survey of demographic characteristics and sexual risk behavior with their three most recent partners. Generalized estimating equations estimated correlations of CAI with location of last sexual contact, participant substance use prior to sex, and negotiation of condom use before or during sex. The network data integration application, Cytoscape, mapped intersections of partner type, sexual orientation, substance use, and CAI by four types of locations where sex occurred: 1) Home, 2) Hotel, 3) Sauna or Internet Cabin, and 4) Public Spaces. Results Of 447 MSM (median age 27 years), 76.9% reported CAI with >= 1 of their last three partners. Participants reported sex with casual partners most commonly in homes (64.6%) and hotels (60.4%), and with anonymous partners most often in saunas/Internet cabins (57.5%) and public spaces (52.6%). CAI was less commonly reported in hotels (aPR, 95% CI: 0.85, 0.75-0.97) compared to homes. Participants who used marijuana before sex at home were more likely to report CAI than MSM who did not use marijuana (1.36, 1.01-1.92). Partner alcohol use before sex was associated with CAI in saunas/Internet cabins (3.17, 1.45-6.91) and public spaces (2.65, 1.41-4.98). In the sexual network maps, almost all MSM who used drugs prior to their sexual encounters used drugs with more than one of their last three partners. Conclusions CAI was common and associated with different risk factors, like partner type and substance use, based on location where sex occurred. Novel combination HIV, STI, and substance use prevention interventions must consider how the social environments of MSM influence condom use and other sexual risk behaviors.

AB BackgroundCyberbullying among children and adolescents is a major public health concern. However, research has not yet definitively identified the risk factors associated with cybervictimization. The purpose of this study was to determine the association of cybervictimization with use of social networks, personality traits and parental education in secondary students.MethodsThe study population consisted of 765 secondary students (56.5% girls) from Majorca (Spain) who were aged 15.99years (grade 4). The data were from the 16 secondary school centers that participated in the ITACA Project, a multi-center, cluster randomized controlled trial. Cybervictimization was measured by the Garaigordobil Cybervictimization Scale, and the Big Five Questionnaire for Children was used to assess personality traits.ResultsResults showed that 39.9% of the students were cybervictims. Univariate analysis indicated that more girls than boys were cybervictimized (43.1% vs 35.7%). Cybervictims spent more time in social networking sites than non-victims (6h 30min vs. 5h 16min) and had greater emotional instability (0.16 vs. -0.23) and extraversion (0.11 vs. -0.09) and were less conscientious (-0.001 vs. 0.20). Multivariable analysis indicated that social networking time was not significantly associated with cybervictimization after controlling for personality traits, but the same personality traits remained significantly associated.ConclusionsOur findings indicate that cyberbullying is a frequent and relevant problem in adolescents. Big Five personality traits are related with cybervictimization. Possible ways to design interventions include promoting social leisure activities, encourage responsible attitudes and provide stress coping tools.

AB BackgroundMild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is an acknowledged public health problem. Up to 25% of adult with mTBI present persistent symptoms. Headache, dizziness, nausea and neck pain are the most commonly reported symptoms and are frequently associated with cervical spine and vestibular impairments. The most recent international consensus statement (2017 Berlin consensus) recommends the addition of an individualized rehabilitation approach for mTBI with persistent symptoms. The addition of an individualized rehabilitation approach including the evaluation and treatment of cervical and vestibular impairments leading to symptoms such as neck pain, headache and dizziness is, however, recommended based only on limited scientific evidence. The benefit of such intervention should therefore be further investigated.ObjectiveTo compare the addition of a 6-week individualized cervicovestibular rehabilitation program to a conventional approach of gradual sub-threshold physical activation (SPA) alone in adults with persistent headache, neck pain and/or dizziness-related following a mTBI on the severity of symptoms and on other indicators of clinical recovery. We hypothesize that such a program will improve all outcomes faster than a conventional approach (between-group differences at 6-week and 12-week).MethodsIn this single-blind, parallel-group randomized controlled trial, 46 adults with subacute (3 to12 weeks post-injury) persistent mTBI symptoms will be randomly assigned to: 1) a 6-week SPA program or 2) SPA combined with a cervicovestibular rehabilitation program. The cervicovestibular rehabilitation program will include education, cervical spine manual therapy and exercises, vestibular rehabilitation and home exercises. All participants will take part in 4 evaluation sessions (baseline, week 6, 12 and 26) performed by a blinded evaluator. The primary outcome will be the Post-Concussion Symptoms Scale. The secondary outcomes will be time to clearance to return to function, number of recurrent episodes, Global Rating of Change, Numerical Pain Rating Scale, Neck Disability Index, Headache Disability Inventory and Dizziness Handicap Inventory. A 2-way ANOVA and an intention-to-treat analysis will be used.DiscussionControlled trials are needed to determine the best rehabilitation approach for mTBI with persistent symptoms such as neck pain, headache and dizziness. This RCT will be crucial to guide future clinical management recommendations.

AB Background Air pollution is a global public health concern. The World Health Organization has recently set up a goal of saving 7 million people globally by 2030 from air pollution related death. We conducted an ecological study of geographical variation to explore the association between air pollution (specifically, particulate matter <2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter [PM2.5], particulate matter <10 mu m in aerodynamic diameter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, nitric oxide, and ozone) and cancer incidence in Taiwan, from 2012 to 2016. Methods In this study, the yearly average concentrations of each air pollutant at 75 air quality monitoring stations were calculated, and using the kriging method, the concentrations were extrapolated to each and every geographical central point of 349 local administrative areas of Taiwan. Spearman rank correlation coefficients between the age-adjusted cancer incidence rates and various air pollutants were calculated by stratifying genders and urbanization degrees of the local administrative areas. A total of 70 correlation coefficients were calculated. Results In total, 17 correlation coefficients were significantly positive at an alpha level of 0.05. Among these, four correlation coefficients between the age-adjusted cancer incidence rates and PM2.5 levels remained significant after Bonferroni correction. For men in developing towns, general towns, and aged towns and for women in aged towns, the age-adjusted cancer incidence rates increased 13.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.8-17.6), 11 (95% CI, 5.6-16.4), 16.7 (95% CI, 6.9-26.4), and 11.9 (95% CI, 5.6-18.2) per 100,000 populations, respectively, for every 1 mu g/m(3) increment in PM2.5 concentrations. Conclusions A significantly positive correlation was observed between the PM2.5 level and cancer incidence rate after multiple testing correction.

AB Background Mumps is a vaccine-preventable disease but outbreaks have been reported in persons vaccinated with two doses of MMR vaccine. The objective was to describe the demographic features, vaccination effectiveness and genetic mumps virus diversity among laboratory-confirmed cases between 2007 and 2011 in Catalonia. Methods Cases and outbreaks of mumps notified to the notifiable diseases system of Catalonia between 2007 and 2011 retrospectively registered were included. Public health care centres provided written immunization records to regional public health staff to determine the vaccination history. Saliva and serum specimens were collected from suspected cases for laboratory-confirmation using real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR (rtRT-PCR) or serological testing. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete SH gene (316 nucleotides) and complete coding HN protein (1749 nucleotides) sequences was made. Categorical variables were compared using the Chi-square or Fisher's tests and continuous variables using the Student test. Vaccination effectiveness by number of MMR doses was estimated using the screening method. Results During the study period, 581 confirmed cases of mumps were notified (incidence rate 1.6 cases/100,000 persons-year), of which 60% were male. Three hundred sixty-four laboratory-confirmed cases were reported, of which 44% were confirmed by rtRT-PCR. Of the 289 laboratory-confirmed cases belonging to vaccination cohorts, 33.5% (97) had received one dose of MMR vaccine and 50% (145) two doses. Based on phylogenetic analyses of 316-nucleotide and 174-nucleotide SH sequences, the viruses belonging to viral genotypes were: genotype G (126), genotype D (23), genotype H (2), genotype F (2), genotype J (1), while one remained uncharacterized. Amino acid differences were detected between circulating strains and the Jeryl Lynn vaccine strains, although the majority of amino acid substitutions were genotype-specific. Fifty-one outbreaks were notified that included 324 confirmed mumps cases. Genotype G was the most frequent genotype detected. The family (35%), secondary schools (25%) and community outbreaks (18%) were the most frequent settings. Conclusions Our study shows that genotype G viruses are the most prevalent in Catalonia. Most cases occurred in people who had received two doses of MMR, suggesting inadequate effectiveness of the Jeryl Lynn vaccine strain. The possible factors related are discussed.

AB Background Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem with increasing prevalence worldwide. It is associated with high mortality and poor quality of life due to recurrent and costly hospital admissions. Several studies have been conducted to describe HF risk predictors in different races, countries and health systems. Nonetheless, understanding population-specific determinants of HF outcomes remains a great challenge. We aim to evaluate predictors of 1-year survival of individuals with systolic heart failure from the GENIUS-HF cohort. Methods We enrolled 700 consecutive patients with systolic heart failure from the SPA outpatient clinic of the Heart Institute, a tertiary health-center in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Inclusion criteria were age between 18 and 80 years old with heart failure diagnosis of different etiologies and left ventricular ejection fraction <= 50% in the previous 2 years of enrollment on the cohort. We recorded baseline demographic and clinical characteristics and followed-up patients at 6 months intervals by telephone interview. Study data were collected and data quality assurance by the Research Electronic Data Capture tools. Time to death was studied using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for demographic, clinical and socioeconomic variables and medication use. Results We screened 2314 consecutive patients for eligibility and enrolled 700 participants. The overall mortality was 6.8% (47 patients); the composite outcome of death and hospitalization was 17.7% (123 patients) and 1% (7 patients) have been submitted to heart transplantation after one year of enrollment. After multivariate adjustment, baseline values of blood urea nitrogen (HR 1.017; CI 95% 1.008-1.027; p < 0.001), brain natriuretic peptide (HR 1.695; CI 95% 1.347-2.134; p < 0.001) and systolic blood pressure (HR 0.982;CI 95% 0.969-0.995; p = 0.008) were independently associated with death within 1 year. Kaplan Meier curves showed that ischemic patients have worse survival free of death and hospitalization compared to other etiologies. Conclusions High levels of BUN and BNP and low systolic blood pressure were independent predictors of one-year overall mortality in our sample.

ID INDUSTRY ACTORS; DEBATE; STATE
AB Background The 2010-2015 Conservative-led Coalition Government launched their flagship Public Health Responsibility Deal (PHRD) for England in 2011; a year before their alcohol strategy. This co-regulatory regime placed alcohol industry actors at the heart of policy-making, but was viewed with scepticism by public health actors. This article examines the ways in which the PHRD structured the alcohol policy environment throughout this period, which included the rejection of evidence-based policies such as minimum unit pricing. Methods This article draws on 26 semi-structured interviews with policy actors (parliamentarians, civil servants, civil society actors and academics) in 2018. Respondents were identified and recruited using purposive sampling. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed using thematic coding. Results The PHRD shaped the context of alcohol policy development at Westminster throughout this period. It circumscribed the policy space by taking evidence-based measures not amenable to industry partnership off the agenda. While the PHRD created important opportunities for industry engagement with policy-makers, it undermined public health actors' access to government, particularly following their withdrawal from the process. Moreover, the PHRD demonstrates the enduring appeal of partnership as a policy idea for governments, despite a lack of evidence of their effectiveness. Conclusions This study of the PHRD demonstrates the ways in which industry actors are able to influence policy through long-term relationship building and partnership working on policy decision-making. Whilst such partnership approaches may appear to have the potential to mitigate some of alcohol harms, they create fundamental conflicts of interest, and may undermine the very causes they seek to further.

AB Background Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) incidence is a critical challenge to disease control and prevention in parts of China, particularly Guangxi. However, the association between socioeconomic factors and meteorological factors on HFMD is still unclear. Methods This study applied global and local Moran's I to examine the spatial pattern of HFMD and series analysis to explore the temporal pattern. The effects of meteorological factors and socioeconomic factors on HFMD incidence in Guangxi, China were analyzed using GeoDetector Model. Results This study collected 45,522 cases from 87 counties in Guangxi during 2015, among which 43,711 cases were children aged 0-4 years. Temporally, there were two HFMD risk peaks in 2015. One peak was in September with 7890 cases. The other appeared in May with 4687 cases of HFMD. A high-risk cluster was located in the valley areas. The tertiary industry, precipitation and second industry had more influence than other risk factors on HFMD incidence with explanatory powers of 0.24, 0.23 and 0.21, respectively. The interactive effect of any two risk factors would enhance the risk of HFMD. Conclusions This study suggests that precipitation and tertiary industry factors might have stronger effects on the HFMD incidence in Guangxi, China, compared with other factors.

DT Article
ID ORGANIZATION
AB Background A Brazilian guideline on cervical cancer screening was released in 2011. The objective was to verify changes in screening indicators around this period. Methods An audit study which sample was all screening tests performed by the public health system of Campinas city from 2010 to 2016. Variables were absolute tests numbers, excess tests, intervals and results, by age. For trend analysis was used Cochran-Armitage x 2 and linear regression. Results Were carried out 62,925 tests in 2010 and 43,523 tests in 2016, a tendency at a reduction (P = 0.001). Excess tests were higher than 50% over the years, with a tendency at a reduction (P < 0.001). Tests performed on women under 25 ranged from 20.2 to 15.4% in the period (P < 0.001), while in the 25-64 years age-group, it ranged from 75.1 to 80.2% (P < 0.001). In 2010 the most frequent interval was annual (47.5%) and in 2016 biennial (34.7%). There was a tendency at a reduction in the proportion of tests performed at the first time and those with an annual interval (P < 0.001), and also a tendency at an increase in tests with intervals equal to or greater than biannual (P < 0.001). We observed a tendency at a reduction in LSIL and HSIL-CIN2 results (P = 0.04 and P = 0.001, respectively), and a tendency at an increase in HSIL-CIN3 result (P = 0.02). Conclusion The proportion of cervical cancer screening tests performed out of the recommendation showed a significant reduction in the period. This indicates a tendency to align cervical cancer screening in Campinas with the standards recommended.

AB Background Caesarean section (CS) is an important lifesaving intervention that can reduce maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality. The dramatic increase in CS rates globally has prompted concerns that the procedure may be overused or used for inappropriate indications. In Egypt, CS rates are alarmingly high, accounting for 52% of all deliveries. This study sought to (1) explore indications and risk factors for CS in public hospitals in four governorates in Egypt and (2) examine health care provider factors impacting the decision to perform a CS. Methods We reviewed medical records for all deliveries that took place during April 2016 in 13 public hospitals situated in four governorates in Egypt (Cairo, Alexandria, Assiut and Behera), and extracted information pertaining to medical indications and women's obstetric characteristics. We also interviewed obstetricians in the study hospitals to explore factors associated with the decision to perform CS. Results A total of 4357 deliveries took place in the study hospitals during that period. The most common medical indications were previous CS (50%), an "other" category (13%), and fetal distress (9%). Multilevel analysis revealed that several obstetric risk factors were associated with increased odds of CS mode of delivery - including previous CS, older maternal age, and nulliparity - while factors such as partograph completion and oxytocin use were associated with reduced odds of CS. Interviews with obstetricians highlighted non-medical factors implicated in the high CS rates, including a convenience incentive, lack of supervision and training in public hospitals, as well as absence of or lack of familiarity with clinical guidelines. Conclusion A combination of both medical and non-medical factors drives the increase in CS rates. Our analysis however suggests that a substantial number of CS deliveries took place in the absence of strong medical justification. Health care provider factors seem to be powerful factors influencing CS rates in the study hospitals.

AB Background Studies of healthcare service use during the pregnancy-postpartum cycle often rely on self-reported data. The reliability of self-reported information is often questioned as administrative data or medical records, such as antenatal care cards, are usually preferred. In this study, we measured the agreement of antenatal care indicators from self-reported information and antenatal care cards of pregnant women in the 2015 Pelotas Birth Cohort, Brazil. Methods In a sample of 3923 mothers, indicator agreement strengths were estimated from Kappa and prevalence-and-bias-adjusted Kappa (PABAK) coefficients. Maternal characteristics associated with indicator agreements were assessed with heterogeneity chi-squared tests. Results The self-reported questionnaire and the antenatal care card showed a moderate to high agreement in 10 of 21 (48%) antenatal care indicators that assessed care service use, clinical examination and diseases during pregnancy. Counseling indicators performed poorly. Self-reported information presented a higher frequency data and a higher sensitivity but slightly lower specificity when compared to the antenatal card. Factors associated with higher agreement between both data sources included lower maternal age, higher level of education, primiparous status, and being a recipient of health care in the public sector. Conclusions Self-reported questionnaire and antenatal care cards provided substantially different information on indicator performance. Reliance on only one source of data to assess antenatal care quality may be questionable for some indicators. From a public health perspective, it is recommended that antenatal care programs use multiple data sources to estimate quality and effectiveness of health promotion and disease prevention in pregnant women and their offspring.

AB Background Leptospirosis is a neglected zoonosis of public health importance transmitted through contact with contaminated soil, water or urine of infected animals. In pigs the disease is characterized by abortion, still births and weak piglets. A cross-sectional study was conducted in May to July 2018 to estimate the sero-prevalence of leptospirosis and factors associated with seropositivity in slaughter pigs. A questionnaire was used to collect information on animal demographics. Serum was tested for anti-leptospiral antibodies using microscopic agglutination test (MAT) with a panel of 8 serovars. Sera were considered positive for sero-reactivity at a MAT titre >= 1:40 against at least one serovar. Chi-square tests were used to measure the strength of association between the MAT test result and exploratory variables. Results A total of 252 pig serum samples from seven slaughterhouses were tested for Leptospira antibodies by MAT. Of the 252 pigs sampled, 88.8% (244/252) were indigenous breeds; 55.6% (140/252) were female and 88.7% (220/252) were reared in extensive production systems. Eighty-three (32.9%; 83/252) sera samples tested positive on MAT against at least one serovar. Of the 8 serovars, the highest prevalence was recorded for serovar Lora 21.4% followed by Kenya 5.2%, Sokoine 3.6% and Grippotyphosa at 3.2%. Risk factors for leptospirosis seropositivity in pigs were: originating from farms with other types of livestock (OR 2.3; 95% CI 1.0-4.5) and mature pigs (OR 1.9; 95% CI 1.1-3.3). Conclusion This study demonstrates that there is a high prevalence of leptospirosis positive pigs at slaughter in a small-holder livestock keeping region of the Lake Victoria basin. The potential for cross species transmission of pathogenic serovars is highlighted as well as the potential for occupational exposure to slaughterhouse personnel. Improvements in husbandry practices (confinement and rodent control) and public health education among slaughterhouse workers and other high-risk groups is recommended.

AB Background Despite the numerous intervention programmes, HIV still remains a public health concern with a high impact in Sub-Saharan Africa region. Oxidative stress has been documented in HIV subjects as viral infection promotes prolonged activation of immune system, hence, production of increased reactive oxygen species. Methods We studied 180 subjects. Of these, 60 were HIV-infected on antiretroviral therapy (ART), 40 were ART naive HIV-infected and 80 were apparent healthy non HIV-infected subjects. The complete blood count was performed by automated hemoanalyzer, the CD4(+) T-cell count was performed by cyflow cytometer, while the antioxidant assay was performed using ELISA technique. Result All evaluated parameters; glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), CD4(+) T-cell count, haemoglobin (Hb), total white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in the HIV-infected subjects. All assessed parameters were found to be significantly (P < 0.5) reduced in the HIV-infected subjects that are ART naive when compared with those on ART. HIV-infected subjects with CD4(+) T-cell count < 200 cells/mm(3) had significantly (P < 0.05) reduced values in all assessed parameters when compared to those with CD4(+) T-cell count >= 200 cells/mm(3). GSH and WBC were found to be significantly (P < 0.05) increased in the female HIV-infected subjects when compared with the male counterpart. Anemia prevalence of 74 and 33% were recorded for the HIV-infected and control subjects, respectively. Gender and ART treatment were found to be associated with anemia in HIV. Male HIV-infected subjects on ART were found to be more likely to have anemia. Conclusion Antioxidants; GSH and GPX were found to be significantly reduced in HIV infection. Further probe showed that the antioxidant status was improved in the HIV-infected group on ART.

AB Background The paper introduces a deep learning-based approach for real-time detection and insights generation about one of the most prevalent chronic conditions in Australia - Pollen allergy. The popular social media platform is used for data collection as cost-effective and unobtrusive alternative for public health monitoring to complement the traditional survey-based approaches. Methods The data was extracted from Twitter based on pre-defined keywords (i.e. 'hayfever' OR 'hay fever') throughout the period of 6 months, covering the high pollen season in Australia. The following deep learning architectures were adopted in the experiments: CNN, RNN, LSTM and GRU. Both default (GloVe) and domain-specific (HF) word embeddings were used in training the classifiers. Standard evaluation metrics (i.e. Accuracy, Precision and Recall) were calculated for the results validation. Finally, visual correlation with weather variables was performed. Results The neural networks-based approach was able to correctly identify the implicit mentions of the symptoms and treatments, even unseen previously (accuracy up to 87.9% for GRU with GloVe embeddings of 300 dimensions). Conclusions The system addresses the shortcomings of the conventional machine learning techniques with manual feature-engineering that prove limiting when exposed to a wide range of non-standard expressions relating to medical concepts. The case-study presented demonstrates an application of 'black-box' approach to the real-world problem, along with its internal workings demonstration towards more transparent, interpretable and reproducible decision-making in health informatics domain.

AB Background Increasing rates of long-term sickness absence are a worldwide problem. Belgium is the first country in Europe that aims to screen its entire population of sick leavers (sick leave > 6 weeks) for the risk of long-term sickness absence in order to focus resources on the high-risk group and to provide adequate return-to-work support. Our aim was to investigate content and face validity of a newly designed questionnaire (Quickscan) using item prioritization of patients and professionals in the field of long-term sickness absence. This questionnaire was developed based on a review of the literature and existing instruments (Goorts et al, J Public Health Res 7:1419, 2018). Methods Qualitative data were collected using the nominal group technique. The data were gathered exploring factors that influence return-to work restrictions or opportunities. Results Participants indicated 20 out of 21 of the questionnaire factors as important reasons that might influence the return-to-work process. Additionally, 16 factors were discussed that were not yet included in the Quickscan but that might provide useful information on return-to-work issues, according to the participants. In the prioritization of items, we found considerable diversity among participants. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate the validity of the Quickscan items to ask patients about important return-to-work barriers or opportunities. However, additional factors were identified that may improve the assessment of risk for long-term sickness absence.

TI Cost savings associated with timely treatment of botulism with botulism
   antitoxin heptavalent product
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; HOSPITALIZATION CHARGES; INFANT BOTULISM; OUTCOMES;
   TRENDS
AB Background
   Botulism is a rare, serious, and sometimes fatal paralytic illness caused by exposure to neurotoxins produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria. Patients with documented or suspected exposure to botulinum toxin serotypes A-G can be treated with BAT (R) [Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (A, B, C, D, E, F, G)-(Equine)] product, which was approved in 2013 in the United States (US). Patients with botulism have demonstrated greater clinical benefit with early BAT product treatment (<= 2 days from symptom onset) versus late treatment (> 2 days).
   Objective
   Economic outcomes associated with improved clinical outcome benefits of BAT product treatment have not yet been reported. This ad hoc analysis aimed to estimate and compare costs associated with hospitalization, intensive care unit stay, and mechanical ventilation for patients with botulism administered BAT product treatment early or late.
   Methods
   Clinical outcomes data for early and late BAT product treatment were obtained from a patient registry conducted between October 2014 and July 2017. Total per patient mean daily costs were estimated based on information from published literature. Total population costs per group were calculated by multiplying estimated mean cost per patient by the average annual number of non-infant botulism cases in the US.
   Results
   Mean per patient costs were 2.5 times lower for patients treated with BAT product early versus late. On average in the US, early BAT product treatment could save greater than $3.9 million per year versus late treatment.
   Conclusion
   Substantial economic savings can be achieved with early BAT product treatment. The findings support the recommendation for public health authorities to ensure antitoxin treatment is readily available in sufficient quantities to manage botulism cases, including sporadic outbreaks and potential mass exposure biological attacks.

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article

   TRENDS; TRIAL; CARE
AB Background
   Fatal opioid overdose is a pressing public health concern in the United States. Addressing barriers and augmenting facilitators to take-home naloxone (THN) access and administration could expand program reach in preventing fatal overdoses.
   Methods
   THN access (i.e., being prescribed or receiving THN) was assessed in a Baltimore, Maryland-based sample of 577 people who use opioids (PWUO) and had a history of injecting drugs. A sub-analysis examined correlates of THN administration among those with THN access and who witnessed an overdose (N = 345). Logistic generalized estimating equations with robust standard errors were used to identify facilitators and barriers to accessing and using THN.
   Results
   The majority of PWUO (66%) reported THN access. In the multivariable model, decreased THN access was associated with the fear that a person may become aggressive after being revived with THN (aOR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.35-0.85), police threaten people at an overdose event (aOR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.36-1.00), and insufficient overdose training (aOR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.28-0.68). Enrollment in medication-assisted treatment, personally experiencing an overdose, and graduating from high school were associated with higher access. About half (49%) of PWUO with THN access and who had witnessed an overdose reported having administered THN. THN use was positively associated with "often" or "always" carrying THN (aOR: 3.47, 95% CI: 1.99-6.06), witnessing more overdoses (aOR:5.18, 95% CI: 2.22-12.07), experiencing recent homelessness, and injecting in the past year. THN use was reduced among participants who did not feel that they had sufficient overdose training (aOR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.32-0.96).
   Conclusion
   THN programs must bolster confidence in administering THN and address barriers to use, such as fear of a THN recipient becoming aggressive. Normative change around carrying THN is an important component in an overdose prevention strategy.

TI Incidence of chronic kidney disease hospitalisations and mortality in
   Espirito Santo between 1996 to 2017
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Introduction
   Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has a set of clinical and laboratory abnormalities where renal function loss is noted. The high prevalence of comorbidity of people living with CKD, its economic impact and its prognosis have made it a public health problem, justifying the need to implement preventive measures.
   Objective
   To analyse the mortality and incidence of hospital admissions for CKD.
   Methods
   Ecological study with a time series design using secondary microdata of deaths and hospital admissions from patients with CKD from 1996 to 2017 in the State of Espi ' rito Santo, Brazil.
   Results
   The average mortality rate of CKD during the studied years was 2.92 per 100,000 inhabitants per year. During this period global mortality was a stationary phenomenon. In women, the trend of mortality from 2005 on increased 7,87% per year. Between 2008 and 2017, the average incidence hospital admissions due to CKD per year was 45.76 per 100,000 inhabitants. It was observed that the overall hospital admission increased by the equivalent of 6.23% per year. More than a half of mortality and hospitalisations correspond to male patients over 50 years of age. In terms of mortality, 32.99% corresponded to Caucasian patients, while 35.13% of hospitalisations were mixed race.
   Conclusion
   We found that age and gender are factors associated with deaths and hospitalisations for chronic kidney disease. While hospitalisation increases 6.23% per year, global mortality remains stationary. However, from 2005 onwards a trend towards increasing of 7.87%/ annual in mortality was observed in women.

DT Article
ID MENTAL PAIN; PSYCHACHE; SUICIDALITY; DRUG
AB Substance Use Disorder (SUD) is a major public health concern affecting an estimated 22.5 million individuals in the United States. The primary aim of this study was to characterize psychological pain in a cohort of patients participating in outpatient treatment for SUD. A secondary aim was to determine the relationships between pre-treatment assessments of psychological pain, depression, anxiety and hopelessness with treatment retention time and completion rates. Data was analyzed from 289 patients enrolled in an outpatient community drug treatment clinic in Southern California, U.S. A previously determined threshold score on the Mee-Bunney Psychological Pain Assessment Scale (MBP) was utilized to group patients into high and low-moderate scoring subgroups. The higher pain group scored higher on measures of anxiety, hopelessness and depression compared to those in the low-moderate pain group. Additionally, patients scoring in the higher psychological pain group exhibited reduced retention times in treatment and more than two-fold increased odds of dropout relative to patients with lower pre-treatment levels of psychological pain. Among all assessments, the correlation between psychological pain and treatment retention time was strongest. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that psychological pain is an important construct which correlates with relevant clinical outcomes in SUD. Furthermore, pre-treatment screening for psychological pain may help target higher-risk patients for clinical interventions aimed at improving treatment retention and completion rates.

AB Background
   Injuries are a major public health problem, resulting in high health care demand and economic burden. They result in loss of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) and high out-of-pocket expenditure. However, there is little evidence on the economic burden of injuries in India. We undertook this study to report out-of-pocket expenditure and the prevalence of catastrophic health expenditure for injuries related hospitalizations in public sector hospitals in North India. Further, we also evaluate the determinants of catastrophic health expenditure.
   Methods and analysis
   A prospective observational study was conducted. Participants were recruited from three hospitals for all injury cases. Data were collected via face-to-face baseline interviews and follow-up interviews over the phone at 1, 2, 4 and 12 months post-injury. Prevalence of catastrophic health expenditure (more than 30% of consumption expenditure) and impoverishment (International dollar 1.90) were estimated.
   Results
   Road traffic injuries (57%) were the leading cause of injury. Direct out-of-pocket expenditure for hospitalizations was INR 16,768 (USD 263) while indirect productivity loss was INR 8,164 (USD 128). The prevalence of catastrophic expenditure was 22.2% with 12.2% slipping below poverty line. Prevalence of catastrophic health expenditure and impoverishment was higher and significantly associated with poorest quintile, tertiary care hospital and increased duration of hospitalization (p < 0.001).
   Conclusion
   The economic impact of injuries is notably high both in terms of out-of-pocket expenditure and productivity loss. A high proportion of households experienced catastrophic expenditure and impoverishment following an injury, highlighting need for programs to prevent injuries.

Institutional delivery under the hygienic environment with the necessary skills and equipment promotes to identify and treat complications, infections, and the death of the mother and baby. In Ethiopia, the utilization of maternal health services is very low. For instance, 62% of women had antenatal care utilization during pregnancy while only 26% of women utilize institutions for delivery in 2016. Therefore, this study examined the association between antenatal care follow up and intestinal delivery among a nationally representative woman in Ethiopia.MethodsA cross-sectional study design was used to examine 7575 women from the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were utilized. Variables in the bivariate logistic regression with p-value <0.2 were entered into the multivariable logistic regression. Odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. In the multivariable analysis, variables with p-value <0.05 were considered as statistically significant.ResultsThe prevalence of institutional delivery service utilization for last childbirth was 11.3%. In comparison with women with no antenatal care visits, the multivariable odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of institutional delivery among those who attend one to three and four or more antenatal care visit were 2.49 (1.66, 3.74) and 3.90 (2.60, 5.84), respectively. Other factors significantly associated with institutional delivery include urban residence 2.25 (1.44, 3.51), complete primary education 3.22 (2.09, 4.98), complete secondary or higher education 1.59 (1.16, 2.17), poorer household wealth index 2.57 (1.57, 4.20), middle household wealth index 1.63 (1.05, 2.52), and richer household wealth index 1.56(1.03, 2.58).ConclusionAntenatal care follow-up was significantly associated with institutional delivery service utilization. As the number of antenatal care visits increased the odds of facility delivery increased. Thus, improved access and utilization of antenatal care can be an effective strategy to increase institutional deliveries and optimal maternal and child health outcomes.

AB BackgroundThe recently increased access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in South Africa has placed additional strain on human and infrastructure resources of the public health sector. Capacity from private-sector General Practitioners (GPs) could be leveraged to ease the current burden on the public health sector.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective record review of routine electronic medical record data on a systematic sample of HIV-infected adults (>= 18years old) initiated on ART at a tertiary hospital outpatient HIV clinic in Johannesburg, South Africa and down-referred to private-GPs for continued care after stabilization on ART. We compared these patients ("GP down-referred") to a control-cohort who remained at the referring site ("Clinic A") and patients from a regional hospital outpatient HIV clinic not offering down-referral to GPs ("Clinic B"). Study outcomes assessed are viral load suppression (VL<50 copies/ml) and attrition from care (all-cause-mortality or>90-days late for a last-scheduled visit) by 12months of follow-up following down-referral or eligibility.ResultsA total of 3685 patients, comprising 373 (10.1%) GP down-referred, 2599 (70.5%) clinic A controls, and 713 (19.4%) clinic B controls were included in the analysis. Overall, 1535 patients (53.3%) had a suppressed viral load. A higher portion of GP down-referred patients had a suppressed viral load compared to clinic A and B patients (65.7% vs 49.1% vs 58.9%). After adjusting for demographic and baseline clinical covariates, we found no difference in viral load suppression between GP down-referred and control patients (adjusted relative risk [aRR] for clinic A vs GP down-referred 1.0; 95% CI: 0.9-1.1), (aRR for clinic B vs GP down-referred 1.0; 95% CI: 0.9-1.2).Clinic B controls experienced the highest attrition compared to GP down-referred and clinic A controls (33.2% vs 11.3% vs 5.9%) and had a higher risk of attrition compared to GP down-referred patients (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 4.2; 95% CI: 2.8-6.5), whereas clinic B controls had a lower risk of attrition (aHR 0.5; 95% CI: 0.3-0.7).Conclusions and recommendationsOur results show that private-GPs can contribute to caring for stabilized public sector HIV patients on life-long ART. However, they require special efforts to improve retention in care.

AB Background and objectives The perinatal period presents a high-risk time for development of mood disorders. Australia-wide universal perinatal care, including depression screening, make this stage amenable to population-level preventative approaches. In a large cohort of women receiving public perinatal care in Sydney, Australia, we examined: (1) the psychosocial and obstetric determinants of women who signal distress on EPDS screening (scoring 10-12) compared with women with probable depression (scoring 13 or more on EPDS screening); and (2) the predictive ability of identifying women experiencing distress during pregnancy in classifying women at higher risk of probable postnatal depression. Methods We analysed routinely collected perinatal data from all live-births within public health facilities from two health districts in Sydney, Australia (N = 53,032). Perinatal distress was measured using the EPDS (scores of 10-12) and probable perinatal depression was measured using the EPDS (scores of 13 or more). Logistic regression models that adjusted for confounding variables were used to investigate a range of psychosocial and obstetric determinants and perinatal distress and depression. Results Eight percent of this cohort experienced antenatal distress and about 5 % experienced postnatal distress. Approximately 6 % experienced probable antenatal depression and 3 % experienced probable postnatal depression. Being from a culturally and linguistically diverse background (AOR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.8-2.3, P < 0.001), a lack of partner support (AOR = 2.9, 95% CI 2.3-3.7) and a maternal history of childhood abuse (AOR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.6-2.3) were associated with antenatal distress. These associations were similar in women with probable antenatal depression. Women who scored 10 to12 on antenatal EPDS assessment had a 4.5 times higher odds (95% CI 3.4-5.9, P < 0.001) of experiencing probable postnatal depression compared with women scoring 9 or less. Conclusion Antenatal distress is more common than antenatal depressive symptoms and postnatal distress or depression. Antenatal maternal distress was associated with probable postnatal depression. Scale properties of the EPDS allows risk-stratification of women in the antenatal period, and earlier intervention with preventively focused programs. Prevention of postnatal depression could address a growing burden of illness and long-term complications for mothers and their infants.

AB Climate change has been described to raise outbreaks of water-born infectious diseases and increases public health concerns. This study aimed at finding out these impacts on cholera infections by using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) from 2021 to 2050. Daily data for cholera infection cases in Qom city, which is located in the center of Iran, were analyzed from 1998 to 2016. To determine the best lag time and combination of inputs, Gamma Test (GT) was applied. General circulation model outputs were utilized to project future climate pattern under two scenarios of Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). Statistical downscaling was done to produce high-resolution synthetic time series weather dataset. ANNs were applied for simulating the impact of climate change on cholera. The observed climate variables including maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation were tagged as predictors in ANNs. Cholera cases were considered as the target outcome variable. Projected future (2020-2050) climate in previous step was carried out to assess future cholera incidence. A seasonal trend in cholera infection was seen. Our results elucidated that the best lag time was 21 days. According to the results of downscaling tool, future climate in the study area by 2050 will be warmer and wetter. Simulation of cholera cases indicated that there is a clear trend of increasing cholera cases under the worst scenario (RCP8.5) by the year 2050 and the highest cholera cases observe in warmer months. The precipitation was recognized as the most effective input variable by sensitivity analysis. We observed a significant correlation between low precipitation and cholera infection. There is a strong evidence to show that cholera disease is correlated with environment variables, as low precipitation and high temperatures in warmer months could provide the swifter bacterial replication. These conditions in Iran, especially in the central parts, may raise the cholera infection rates. Furthermore, ANNs is an executive tool to simulate the impact of climate change on cholera to estimate the future trend of cholera incidence for adopting protective measures in endemic areas.

   ASSOCIATION; EXERCISE
AB Purpose
   Light physical activity (LPA) and patterns of sedentary behavior influence cardio-metabolic health independently of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Understanding the trajectory and determinants of these activity levels over time may provide insights relevant to public health practice.
   Methods
   We measured a cohort of young women recruited in middle school (age 14) using accelerometry for 1 week and remeasured them in high school (age 17) and again at age 23 (n = 385). We assessed changes in LPA and patterns of sedentary behavior by hours in a day. We examined the association of social and contextual factors, including employment status, screen time, and neighborhood context with LPA and sedentary behavior patterns.
   Results
   The amount of LPA decreased over time, while the length of LPA bouts tended to increase. Sedentary bout durations increased over time and sedentary breaks decreased. Sedentary time and bout length were correlated with internet use, rather than with TV or videogaming. Employment was associated with less sedentary time; being a student was associated with longer sedentary time and bouts.
   Conclusions
   Because LPA and sedentary breaks can be protective for cardio-metabolic health, and the duration of sedentary bouts increase as women age from adolescence to young adulthood, worksites and college campuses should remind employees and students to take frequent activity breaks when they use computers and the internet for long stretches.

AB Background Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica is a public health issue related to food safety, and its adaptation to animal sources remains poorly described at the pangenome scale. Firstly, serovars presenting potential mono- and multi-animal sources were selected from a curated and synthetized subset of Enterobase. The corresponding sequencing reads were downloaded from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) providing a balanced dataset of 440 Salmonella genomes in terms of serovars and sources (i). Secondly, the coregenome variants and accessory genes were detected (ii). Thirdly, single nucleotide polymorphisms and small insertions/deletions from the coregenome, as well as the accessory genes were associated to animal sources based on a microbial Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) integrating an advanced correction of the population structure (iii). Lastly, a Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis (GOEA) was applied to emphasize metabolic pathways mainly impacted by the pangenomic mutations associated to animal sources (iv). Results Based on a genome dataset including Salmonella serovars from mono- and multi-animal sources (i), 19,130 accessory genes and 178,351 coregenome variants were identified (ii). Among these pangenomic mutations, 52 genomic signatures (iii) and 9 over-enriched metabolic signatures (iv) were associated to avian, bovine, swine and fish sources by GWAS and GOEA, respectively. Conclusions Our results suggest that the genetic and metabolic determinants of Salmonella adaptation to animal sources may have been driven by the natural feeding environment of the animal, distinct livestock diets modified by human, environmental stimuli, physiological properties of the animal itself, and work habits for health protection of livestock.

AB Background The overweight/obesity epidemic is a public health issue in the United States (US), that disproportionately affect certain racial/ethnic minority groups. Perceived discrimination has been implicated as a health risk factor. However, research on race/ethnicity, perceived discrimination, and obesity has been mixed. Researchers suggest that perceptions of discrimination may be dependent upon nativity status. This study evaluated the role that nativity status and race/ethnicity play in the relationship between perceived discrimination and overweight/obesity. Methods We used Wave 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (2004-2005) [N = 33,319]). Multinomial logistic regression assessed a three-way interaction (perceived discrimination x race/ethnicity x nativity) on overweight and obesity, adjusting for sociodemographic factors and health-related behaviors. Results The three-way interaction was significant for overweight [F (17, 49) = 3.35; p < 0.001] and obesity [F (17, 49) = 5.05; p < 0.001]. Among US-born individuals, US-born non-Hispanic Blacks had a decreased risk of being obese compared to US-born non-Hispanic Whites at mean levels of perceived discrimination [aRRR = 0.71; 95% CI (0.51-0.98); p = 0.04). Among foreign-born individuals, foreign-born South Americans had an increased risk of being overweight at mean levels of perceived discrimination compared to foreign-born non-Hispanic Whites [aRRR = 8.07; 95% CI (1.68-38.77); p = 0.01], whereas foreign-born Dominicans had a decreased risk of being obese compared to foreign-born non-Hispanic Whites [aRRR = 0.05; 95% CI (0.01-0.20); p < 0.001]. Conclusion Perceived racial discrimination is a risk factor for overweight/obesity for certain groups. Race/ethnicity and nativity may play important roles in the relationship between perceived discrimination and overweight/obesity. Future research is needed to identify the behavioral and psychological pathways that link perceived discrimination and overweight/obesity.

AB BackgroundPositive mental health may support healthy development in childhood, although few studies have investigated this at a population level. We aimed to construct a measure of mental health competence (MHC), a skills-based assessment of positive mental health, using existing survey items in a representative sample of UK children, and to investigate its overlap with mental health difficulties (MHD), socio-demographic patterning, and relationships with physical health and cognitive development.MethodsWe analysed the UK Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) when children were aged 11years. Maternal (n =12,082) and teacher (n =6739) reports of prosocial behaviours (PS) and learning skills (LS) were entered into latent class models to create MHC measures. Using descriptive statistics, we examined relationships between MHC and MHD, and the socio-demographic patterning of MHC. Associations between MHC and physical health and cognitive development were examined with relative risk ratios [RRR] (from multinomial models): BMI status (healthy weight, overweight, obesity); unintentional injuries since age 7 (none, 1, 2+); asthma symptoms (none, 1, 2+); and tertiles of test scores for verbal ability, spatial working memory and risk-taking. Models were adjusted for potential confounding.ResultsFour MHC classes were identified [percentages for maternal and teacher reports, respectively]: high MHC (high PS, high LS) [37%; 39%], high-moderate MHC (high PS, moderate LS) [36%; 26%]; moderate MHC (moderate PS, moderate LS) [19%; 19%]; low MHC (moderate PS, low LS) [8%; 16%]. Higher MHC was less common in socially disadvantaged children. While MHC and MHD were associated, there was sufficient separation to indicate that MHC captures more than the absence of MHD. Compared to children with high MHC, those in other MHC classes tended to have poorer physical health and cognitive development, particularly those with low MHC or high-moderate MHC. For example, children with maternal-report Low MHC were more likely to have experienced 2+ unintentional injuries (RRR: 1.5 [1.1-2.1]) and to have lower verbal ability scores (RRR: 2.5 [1.9-3.2]). Patterns of results were similar for maternal- and teacher-report MHC.ConclusionMHC is not simply the inverse of MHD, and high MHC is associated with better physical health and cognitive development. Findings suggest that interventions to improve MHC may support healthy development, although they require replication.

AB BackgroundIschemic heart disease (IHD) is one of the leading causes of deaths worldwide and causes a tremendous disease burden. Temperature is an important environmental determinant among the many risk factors for IHD. However, the emerging temperature-related health risks of IHD in the elderly is limited because of the lack of estimates that integrate global warming and demographic change.MethodsData on daily IHD deaths in the elderly aged >= 65years and meteorological conditions were collected in Tianjin, a megacity of China, from 2006 to 2011. First, the baseline relationship between the temperature and years of life lost (YLL) from IHD was established. Then, future assessments were performed in combination with temperature projections for 19 global-scale climate models (GCMs) under 3 representative concentration pathways (RCPs) for the 2050s and 2070s.ResultsIncreased YLL from IHD in the elderly was found to be associated with future ambient temperatures. The annual temperature-related YLL from IHD in the 2050s and 2070s were higher than the baseline. For instance, increases of 4.5, 14.9 and 38.3% were found under the RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively, in the 2070s. The most significant increases occurred in warm season months. The increase in heat-related YLL will not be completely offset, even with the 25% adaptation assumed. When considering demographic change, the temperature-related disease burden of IHD in the elderly will be exacerbated by 158.4 to 196.6% under 3 RCPs in the 2050s and 2070s relative to the baseline.ConclusionsThese findings have significant meaning for environmental and public health policy making and interventions towards the important issue of the health impacts of global warming on the elderly.

AB BackgroundPesticides remain the mainstay for the control of agricultural pests and disease vectors. However, their indiscriminate use in agriculture has led to development of resistance to both crop pests and disease vectors. This threatens to undermine the success gained through the implementation of chemical based vector control programs. We investigated the practices of farmers with regard to pesticide usage in the vegetable growing areas and their impact on susceptibility status of An. gambiae s.l.MethodsA stratified multistage sampling technique using the administrative structure of the Tanzanian districts as sampling frame was used. Wards, villages and then participants with farms where pesticides are applied were purposively recruited at different stages of the process, 100 participants were enrolled in the study. The same villages were used for mosquito larvae sampling from the farms and the surveys were complimented by the entomological study. Larvae were reared in the insectary and the emerging 2-3days old female adults of Anopheles gambiae s.l were subjected to susceptibility test.ResultsForty eight pesticides of different formulations were used for control of crop and Livestock pests. Pyrethroids were the mostly used class of pesticides (50%) while organophosphates and carbamates were of secondary importance. Over 80% of all farmers applied pesticides in mixed form. Susceptibility test results confirmed high phenotypic resistance among An. gambiae populations against DDT and the pyrethroids (Permethrin-0.75%, Cyfluthrin-0.15%, Deltametrin-0.05% and Lambdacyhalothrin-0.05%) with mortality rates 54, 61, 76 and 71%, respectively. Molecular analysis showed An. arabiensis as a dominant species (86%) while An. gambiae s.s constituted only 6%. The kdr genes were not detected in all of the specimens that survived insecticide exposures.ConclusionThe study found out that there is a common use of pyrethroids in farms, Livestocks as well as in public health. The study also reports high phenotypic resistance among An. gambiae s.l against most of the pyrethroids tested. The preponderance of pyrethroids in agriculture is of public health concern because this is the class of insecticides widely used in vector control programs and this calls for combined integrated pest and vector management (IPVM).

AB BackgroundUrbanization and aging are global phenomena that offer unique challenges in different countries. A supportive environment plays an important role in addressing the issues of health behavioral change and health promotion (e.g., prevent chronic illnesses, promote mental health) among older adults. With the development of the socio-ecological theoretical model, studies on the impact of supportive environments on physical activity have become popular in the public health field in the EU and US. Meanwhile, very few Chinese studies have examined the relationship between built environment features and older adults' physical activity at the ecological level. The purpose of the study is to investigate how the factors part of the built environment of Nanjing's communities also influence leisure time physical activity among the elderly.MethodsUsing a socio-ecological model as a theoretical framework, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 399 elderly people from 19 communities in Nanjing, China, using a one-on-one questionnaire to collect data, including participants' perceived built environment and self-reported physical activity. A multivariate linear regression method was used to analyze the factors influencing their recreational physical activity.ResultsThis study found that compared to older people with low average monthly income, the recreational physical activity of the elderly with average monthly incomes between 1001 and 2000 yen (beta=23.31, p<0.001) and 2001 yen or more (beta=21.15, p<0.001) are significantly higher. After controlling for individual covariates, street connectivity (beta=7.34, p=0.030) and street pavement slope (beta=-7.72, p=0.020), we found that two out of ten built environment factors indicators influence their physical activity. The importance of each influencing factor ranked from highest to lowest are monthly average income, street pavement slope, and street connectivity. Other factors were not significantly related to recreational physical activity by the elderly.ConclusionsOlder adults with a high income were more likely to participate in recreational physical activity than those with a low income. In order to positively impact physical activity in older adults and ultimately improve health, policymakers and urban planners need to ensure that street connectivity and street pavement slope are factored into the design and development of the urban environment.

AB Background Malaria and tetanus infections among pregnant women represent two major public health problems in sub-Saharan Africa. Optimum use of Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) and immunization against tetanus among pregnant women during antenatal care (ANC) visits are recommended strategies to prevent these issues. Despite these recommendations, many women in Africa remain deprived of these cost-effective and life-saving interventions. In this study, we aimed to examine the prevalence of women using these two services, and the association between women's uptake of IPTp-SP and tetanus toxoid (TT) with antenatal care use in Ivory Coast. Methods This study was based on the fifth round of Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS 5) conducted in Ivory Coast in 2016. Participants were 9583 women aged between 15 and 49 years. Outcomes were TT and Intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP). Data analysis was conducted using bivariate and multiple logistic regression. Results In this study, the prevalence of taking TT immunization and IPTp-SP drugs was 81.97 and 17.83% respectively. Of the participants who took these drugs at all, the prevalence of taking adequate doses of TT immunization was 78.75% and that of IPTp-SP was 35.46%. In the multivariable analysis model, higher age groups, 25-29 years (OR = 2.028, 95%CI = 1.120-3.669) were found to be positively associated with uptake of adequate doses of IPTp-SP drugs. Women who attended at least four ANC visits had higher odds of taking IPTp-SP drugs (OR = 1.656, 95%CI = 1.194-2.299) and TT immunization (OR = 2.347, 95%CI = 1.384-3.981), and also had higher odds of receiving adequate doses of IPTp-SP drugs (OR = 3.291, 95%CI = 2.157-5.020) and that of TT immunization (OR = 1.968, 95%CI = 1.398-2.771). The odds of taking IPTp-SP drugs were significantly higher among women with primary (OR = 2.504, 95%CI = 1.020-6.146) and secondary/higher education (OR = 3.298, 95%CI = 1.343-8.097) compared to those with no education. Also, women with higher parity had lower odds of taking TT immunization (OR = 0.218, 95%CI = 0.055-0.858) compared to those with lower parity. Findings from this study also revealed that the odds of taking adequate doses of IPTp-SP drugs were significantly lower among participants from Mande du Nord ethnicity (OR = 0.378,95%CI = 0.145-0.983) compared to those from other ethnicities. Conclusion In this study, uptake of IPTp-SP drugs was much lower than TT immunization. High number of ANC visits were found to be significantly associated with taking IPTp-SP drugs and TT immunization and also with that of taking them in adequate doses. Vaccination promotion is necessary to protect pregnant women and reduce adverse health outcomes among the newborn in Ivory Coast.

AB Background Bladder cancer (BC) has become a major worldwide public health issue, especially non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). A flood of related clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) have emerged; however, the quality and recommendations of the guidelines are controversial. We aimed to appraise the quality of the CPGs for NMIBC within the past 5 years and compare the similarities and differences between recommendations for therapies. Methods A systematic search to identify CPGs for NMIBC was performed using electronic databases (including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science), guideline development organizations, and professional societies from January 12, 2014 to January 12, 2019. The Appraisal of Guidelines Research & Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument was used to evaluate the quality of the guidelines. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) analysis was performed to assess the overall agreement among reviewers. Results Nine CPGs were included. The overall agreement among reviewers was excellent. The interquartile range (IQR) of scores for each domain were as follows: scope and purpose 69.44% (35.42, 85.42%); stakeholder involvement 41.67% (30.56, 75.00%); rigour of development 48.96% (27.08, 65.63%); clarity and presentation 80.56% (75.00, 86.11%); applicability 34.38% (22.92, 40.63%) and editorial independence 70.83% (35.42, 85.42%). The NICE, AUA, EAU and CRHA/CPAM clinical practice guidelines consistently scored well in most domains. It was generally accepted that the transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) and intravesical chemotherapy should be performed in the management of bladder cancer. The application of chemotherapy was highly controversial in high risk NMIBC. The courses of BCG maintenance were similar and included 3 years of therapy at full maintenance doses. Conclusions The quality of NMIBC guidelines within the past 5 years varied, especially regarding stakeholders, rigour and applicability. Despite many similarities, the recommendations had some inconsistencies in the details.

AB Background For decades, bioprospecting has proven to be useful for the identification of compounds with pharmacological potential. Considering the great diversity of Colombian plants and the serious worldwide public health problem of dengue-a disease caused by the dengue virus (DENV)-in the present study, we evaluated the anti-DENV effects of 12 ethanolic extracts derived from plants collected in the Colombian Caribbean coast, and 5 fractions and 5 compounds derived from Psidium guajava. Methods The cytotoxicity and antiviral effect of 12 ethanolic extracts derived from plants collected in the Colombian Caribbean coast was evaluated in epithelial VERO cells. Five fractions were obtained by open column chromatography from the ethanolic extract with the highest selectivity index (SI) (derived from P. guajava, SI: 128.2). From the fraction with the highest selectivity (Pg-YP-I-22C, SI: 35.5), five compounds were identified by one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The antiviral effect in vitro of the fractions and compounds was evaluated by different experimental strategies (Pre- and post-treatment) using non-toxic concentrations calculated by MTT method. The DENV inhibition was evaluated by plate focus assay. The results were analyzed by means of statistical analysis using Student's t-test. Finally the antiviral effect in Silico was evaluated by molecular docking. Results In vitro evaluation of these compounds showed that three of them (gallic acid, quercetin, and catechin) were promising antivirals as they inhibit the production of infectious viral particles via different experimental strategies, with the best antiviral being catechin (100% inhibition with a pre-treatment strategy and 91.8% with a post-treatment strategy). When testing the interactions of these compounds with the viral envelope protein in silico by docking, only naringin and hesperidin had better scores than the theoretical threshold of - 7.0 kcal/mol (- 8.0 kcal/mol and - 8.2 kcal/mol, respectively). All ligands tested except gallic acid showed higher affinity to the NS5 protein than the theoretical threshold. Conclusion Even though bioprospecting has recently been replaced by more targeted tools for identifying compounds with pharmacological potential, our results show it is still useful for this purpose. Additionally, combining in vitro and in silico evaluations allowed us to identify promising antivirals as well as their possible mechanisms of action.

AB BackgroundFetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is a public health problem globally, with South Africa having the highest recorded prevalence of all countries. Government programmes to prevent and manage FASD remain limited because of the lack of a specific policy. Herein, we developed a guideline to inform policy on the prevention and management of FASD in South Africa.MethodsWe applied a modified version of the World Health Organization's approach to guideline development in three phases. In the first phase, we designed the initial guideline prototype. To do this, we conducted an in-depth interview with policymakers and a focus group with relevant service providers on policy requirements for FASD, a document review of policies on FASD and a scoping review of various interventions for FASD. In phase 2, we refined the initially formulated guideline prototype through a discursive approach with seven local and international experts on FASD. Phase 3 involved refining the prototype using a modified Delphi approach. Forty-three and forty-one experts participated in rounds 1 and 2 of the Delphi approach, respectively. The acceptable consensus for each included policy statement was 85%.ResultsWe identified three aspects of the proposed guideline, which are the approaches and guiding principles, the prevention measures and the management measures. The guideline proposes that a FASD policy should consider lifespan needs, be culturally diverse, collaborative, evidence-based, multi-sectoral and address social determinants of health contributing to FASD. The essential components of FASD prevention policy consist of awareness and education of the dangers of drinking alcohol, access to treatment for alcohol problems and training of service providers. The management components include capacity building related to diagnosis, educating parents regarding the needs and management, appropriate referral pathways, training of teachers regarding classroom management and support for parents and individuals with FASD.ConclusionFASD in South Africa deserves urgent attention. Developing a specific policy to guide programmes could enhance and coordinate the efforts towards preventing and managing FASD. The guideline has the potential to assist policymakers in the development of a comprehensive and multi-sectoral policy for prevention and management of FASD, considering the consensus obtained from the experts.

AB BackgroundConsumers frequently access the internet looking for health information. With the growing burden of chronic disease internationally, strategies are focussing on self-management interventions in community and ambulatory settings. The objective of this scoping review was to describe publicly available information on Australian airway clearance services.MethodsPublicly funded health services network webpages and Google were systematically searched between July and November 2018 using relevant keywords. We identified the number, location and currency of contact information of services; and described the services that were in operation and/or identifiable on the internet. Where specific airway clearance services were not identifiable via searching methods, webpages were navigated for associated physiotherapy services. All identified services were contacted via the listed phone or email to confirm web-based findings.ResultsSearching 131 publicly funded health service pages and 191 keyword hits identified four publicly funded airway clearance services (two of which were in operation when confirmed by direct contact) and six private services, all in metropolitan areas of capital cities. Webpages described who their services were for (9/10 services), how to gain referral (4/10) and types of airway clearance techniques available (5/10). A further 286 public physiotherapy services were identified, of which 24 (8%) included descriptors of service provision for respiratory patients on their webpage. In contrast, on direct telephone enquiry airway clearance intervention of some kind was confirmed as being available at 174/286 (61%) sites and unavailable at 69/286 (24%) sites.ConclusionsThis scoping review demonstrated inconsistencies between airway clearance service information available on the internet and the reported provision of services confirmed by direct phone contact. Services that are available need to make information visible to consumers on the internet and include details such as referral pathways, interventions and current contact details, to support people with airway clearance problems to access appropriate care in the community.

AB BackgroundStudies aimed at improving the provision of evidence-based care (EBC) for the management of acute whiplash injuries have been largely successful. However, whether EBC is broadly provided and whether delivery of EBC varies based on risk of non-recovery, is uncertain. Receiving EBC should improve recovery, though this relationship has yet to be established. Further, mitigating the effect of EBC is the relationship with the practitioner, a phenomenon poorly understood in WAD. This study aimed to determine the proportion of individuals with whiplash, at differing baseline risk levels, receiving EBC. This study also aimed to determine whether receiving EBC and the therapeutic relationship were associated with recovery at 3months post injury.MethodsParticipants with acute whiplash were recruited from public hospital emergency departments, private physiotherapy practices, and State Insurance Regulatory Authority (SIRA) databases. Participants completed questionnaires at baseline (demographics, risk of non-recovery) and 3-months (treatment received, risk identification, therapeutic relationship) post injury. Primary health care providers (HCPs) treating these participants also completed questionnaires at 3-months. Recovery was defined as neck disability index <= 4/50 and global perceived effect of >= 4/5.ResultsTwo-hundred and twenty-eight people with acute whiplash, and 53 primary care practitioners were recruited. The majority of the cohort reported receiving EBC, with correct application of the Canadian C-spine rule (74%), and provision of active treatments (e.g. 89% receiving advice) high. Non-recommended (passive) treatments were also received by a large proportion of the cohort (e.g. 50% receiving massage). The therapeutic relationship was associated with higher odds of recovery, which was potentially clinically significant (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.18-1.62). EBC was not significantly associated with recovery.ConclusionsGuideline-based knowledge and practice has largely been retained from previous implementation strategies. However, recommendations for routine risk identification and tailored management, and reduction in the provision of passive treatment have not. The therapeutic relationship was identified as one of several important predictors of recovery, suggesting that clinicians must develop rapport and understanding with their patients to improve the likelihood of recovery.

AB BackgroundA recent study demonstrated the effectiveness of the New Hampshire Colorectal Cancer Screening Program's (NHCRCSP) patient navigation (PN) program. The PN intervention was delivered by telephone with navigators following a rigorous, six-topic protocol to support low-income patients to complete colonoscopy screening. We applied the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance) framework to examine implementation processes and consider potential scalability of this intervention.MethodsA mixed-methods evaluation study was conducted including 1) a quasi-experimental, retrospective, comparison group study examining program effectiveness, 2) secondary analysis of NHCRCSP program data, and 3) a case study. Data for all navigated patients scheduled and notified of their colonoscopy test date between July 1, 2012 and September 30, 2013 (N=443) were analyzed. Researchers were provided in-depth call details for 50 patients randomly selected from the group of 443. The case study included review of program documents, observations of navigators, and interviews with 27 individuals including staff, patients, and other stakeholders.ResultsProgram reach was state-wide, with navigators serving patients from across the state. The program successfully recruited patients from the intended priority population who met the established age, income, and insurance eligibility guidelines. Analysis of the 443 NHCRCSP patients navigated during the study period demonstrated effectiveness with 97.3% completing colonoscopy, zero missed appointments (no-shows), and 0.7% late cancellations. Trained and supervised nurse navigators spent an average of 124.3min delivering the six-topic PN protocol to patients. Navigators benefited from a real-time data system that allowed for patient tracking, communication across team members, and documentation of service delivery. Evaluators identified several factors supporting program maintenance including consistent funding support from CDC, a strong program infrastructure, and partnerships.ConclusionsFactors supporting implementation included funding for colonoscopies, use of registered nurses, a clinical champion, strong partnerships with primary care and endoscopy sites, fidelity to the PN protocol, significant intervention dose, and a real-time data system. Further study is needed to assess scalability to other locations.

TI Choice of birth place among antenatal clinic attendees in rural mission
   hospitals in Ebonyi State, South-East Nigeria
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CARE
AB Background
   Low utilization of health facilities for delivery by pregnant women poses a public health challenge in Nigeria.
   Aim
   To determine the factors that influence the choice of birth place among antenatal clinic attendees.
   Methodology
   This was a cross-sectional study of the eligible antenatal clinic attendees recruited at Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Afikpo and Saint Vincent Hospital, Ndubia in Ebonyi State from February 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016. Analysis was done using EPI Info 7.21 software (CDC Atlanta Georgia).
   Results
   A total of 397(99.3%) completely filled questionnaires were collated and analysed. Approximately 71% of the health facilities closest to the respondents had maternity services. It took at least 1 hour for 80.9% of the respondents to access health facilities with maternity services. Most (60.2%) of the respondents had at least one antenatal clinic attendance and majority of them did so at public hospitals. Approximately 43.8% of the respondents were delivered by the skilled birth attendants. The respondents' age and the couple's educational level, history of antenatal clinic attendance, distance of the health facility and availability of transport fare had a significant effect on delivery by skilled birth attendants. The common determinants of birth place were nearness of the health facilities, familiarity of healthcare providers, improved services, sudden labour onset and cost. Also 61.7% of the respondents chose to deliver in public health facilities due to favourable reasons but this could be hampered by the rudeness of some healthcare providers at such facilities. A significant proportion of private health facilities had unskilled manpower and shortage of drugs.
   Conclusion
   A greater proportion of women will prefer to deliver in health facilities. However there are barriers to utilization of these facilities hence the need to address such barriers.

TI The household economic costs associated with depression symptoms: A
   cross-sectional household study conducted in the North West province of
   South Africa

AB Aim
   The aim of this study was to assess the association between depression symptom severity and household income, consumption, asset-based wealth, debt and use of distress financing strategies, to understand how depression symptom severity and household economic welfare are related.
   Methods
   A household survey was administered to the households of primary health clinic-attenders who were screened for depression symptoms using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire in the chronic care units of four primary health clinics in the North West province of South Africa. Univariate and multivariable regression models were used to assess whether a range of household economic measures were significant predictors of depression symptom severity; and whether depression symptom severity significantly predicted changes to household economic welfare, across a number of different economic measures using both multiple linear regression and logistic regression analyses.
   Results
   On univariate analysis, certain characteristics were associated with significantly worse (higher) PHQ-9 scores, namely: households in which the household head was younger, female, and unmarried; households in which the indexed patient was younger, and did not receive an education beyond primary school; increasing household size, receipt of a social grant, households living in housing constructed of metal sheet walls and households making use of a public tap as their primary water source. In addition, univariate analysis demonstrated that higher log-transformed food expenditure, lower log-transformed capacity to pay, the presence of household debt and both reducing the size or frequency of meals and drawing up retail shop accounts in response to financial distress over the past three years were associated with significantly worse (higher) PHQ-9 scores. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that larger household sizes (p<0.05), receipt of social grants (p<0.05), higher food expenditure (p<0.01), and drawing up retail shop accounts in response to financial distress (p<0.05) were independently predictive of worse (higher) PHQ-9 scores. Inversely, increasing age of the household head (p<0.05), having piped water directly into the household (as opposed to making use of a public water sources) (p<0.01), and increasing capacity to pay (p<0.01) were independently predictive of better (lower) PHQ-9 scores. Similarly, multivariable analysis demonstrated that worse (higher) PHQ-9 scores were independently predictive of lower household capacity to pay (p<0.10) and higher food expenditure (p<0.01).
   Conclusions
   This study is the first of its kind in South Africa, identifying household economic factors associated with increased depression symptom severity on a continuum; and demonstrating that financial risk protection efforts are needed across this continuum. The study demonstrates that the relationship between poverty and mental health extends beyond the individual to affect household economic functioning. These findings must be included in policy considerations to achieve effective protection for vulnerable households facing the interaction of depression and adverse economic circumstances.

TI Barriers to implementation of emergency obstetric and neonatal care in
   rural Pakistan
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MATERNAL MORTALITY; HEALTH; CHALLENGES; CONFLICT; CULTURE
AB Background
   Recognizing the need for improving maternal and newborn care, the Punjab public health department (Pakistan) launched emergency obstetric neonatal care (EmONC) services under WHO guideline. Unfortunately, the program implementation is facing some serious problems. The purpose of this study was to identify barriers to implementation of EmONC in district Bahawalnagar (Pakistan).
   Methods
   This study used sequential exploratory design. Specifically, a qualitative study was conducted to identify barriers to EmONC. Subsequently, the relative importance of these barriers was determined in a quantitative study. Participants were health service providers involved in 24-hours basic EmONC services in the basic health units of district Bahawalnagar (Pakistan). Qualitative data were gathered by interviewing the participants using key informant guide. Quantitative data were collected in a rank order survey of the same participants. The methodological quality was assessed using mixed methods appraisal tool (MMAT) version 2011.
   Results
   The results indicate that lack of teamwork, conflict management, communication, and improper power distribution are important interpersonal barriers. The significant organizational-level barriers include job insecurity, lack of organizational culture, human resource deployment issues, and lack of role clarity. Lack of target management, lack of resource availability, house job requirement, and dual practice issues were identified as major system-level barriers.
   Conclusion
   Barriers to EmONC implementation must be addressed for improving maternal and neonatal care in district Bahawalnagar.

TI Evaluating the cross-cultural validity of the Dutch version of the
   Social Exclusion Index for Health Surveys (SEI-HS): A mixed methods
   study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CHECKLIST; QUALITY
AB Background
   The recently developed Social Exclusion Index for Health Surveys (SEI-HS) revealed particularly strong social exclusion in non-Western immigrant groups compared to the native Dutch population. To qualify such results, cross-cultural validation of the SEI-HS in non-Western immigrant groups is called for.
   Methods
   A sequential explanatory mixed methods design was used, employing quantitative data from the Netherlands Public Health Monitor along with qualitative interviews. Data from 1,803 adults aged 19 years or older of Surinamese, 1,009 of Moroccan and 1,164 of Turkish background and 19,318 native Dutch living in the four largest cities in the Netherlands were used to test the factorial structure of the SEI-HS and differential item functioning across immigrant groups. Additionally, 52 respondents with a high score on the SEI-HS and from different background were interviewed on the item content of the SEI-HS and subjective feelings of exclusion. For each SEI-HS item the semantic, conceptual and contextual connotations were coded and compared between the immigrant groups and native Dutch.
   Results
   High levels of social exclusion were found in 20.0% of the urban population of Surinamese origin, 20.9% of Moroccan, 28.7% of Turkish and 4.2% of native Dutch origin. The 4-factor structure of the SEI-HS was confirmed in all three immigrant groups. None of the items demonstrated substantial differential item functioning in relation to immigration background. The interviews uncovered some methodological shortcomings, but these did not substantially impact the observed excess of social exclusion in immigrant groups.
   Conclusions
   The present study provides evidence in support of the validity of the SEI-HS in adults of Surinamese, Moroccan and Turkish background and confirms the major social exclusion of these immigrant groups in the main cities in the Netherlands. Policy measures to enhance social inclusion and reduce exclusion are urgently needed.

AB Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global public health problem. The burden of the disease is high in low and middle income countries like Ethiopia. However, for highly vulnerable groups such as health professionals, vaccination coverage is a major issue in the developing countries where health professionals are expected to pay for vaccination. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess health professionals' acceptance and willingness to pay (WTP) and associated factors for vaccination against HBV.
   Methods: Cross-sectional study was conducted from March to April, 2017 in Gondar city administration governmental health institutions among 423 health professionals. Simple random sampling method was employed to select the study participants. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaire. Tobit model was used to analyze the determinants of WTP and the maximum amount of money the individuals might pay for HBV vaccination. P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
   Result: A total of 423 health professionals (physicians, nurses, midwives, laboratory technicians/technologists, and others) participated in the study with a response rate of 100, and 62.4% of them were willing to pay for HBV vaccination. The mean amount of money the participants might pay for HBV vaccination was 325.83 +/- 283.46 ETB (US$ 14.39 +/- 12.52). The study indicated that the WTP for HBV vaccination of health professionals from health centers was 179.41 ETB less compared to health professionals from hospital. The WTP for HBV vaccination of the participants who had no experience of seeing previous patients with HBV was 157.87 ETB less compared to participants who had experience of seeing previous patients with HBV. As monthly income of the study participants increased by one ETB, the WTP was increased by 0.027 ETB.
   Conclusion: The study revealed that the mean amount of money the participants might pay for HBV vaccination was much less than the market price for HBV vaccination. Type of workplace and experience of seeing/observing patients with HBV, and income were the predictors of WTP for HBV vaccination. Availing the vaccine with affordable cost in governmental health institutions may increase WTP of health professionals for HBV vaccination.

DE Co-design; Public and patient involvement; Frailty; Older people; Health
   system; Person-centred care
ID HEALTH-CARE
AB Background: Although not an inevitable part of ageing, frailty is an increasingly common condition in older people. Frail older patients are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of hospitalisation, including deconditioning, immobility and loss of independence (Chong et al, J Am Med Dir Assoc 18:638.e7-638.e11, 2017). The 'Systematic Approach to improving care for Frail older patients' (SAFE) study co-designed, with public and patient representatives, quality improvement initiatives aimed at enhancing the delivery of care to frail older patients within an acute hospital setting. This paper describes quality improvement initiatives which resulted from a co-design process aiming to improve service delivery in the acute setting for frail older people. These improvement initiatives were aligned to five priority areas identified by patients and public representatives.
   Methods: The co-design work was supported by four pillars of effective and meaningful public and patient representative (PPR) involvement in health research (Bombard et al, Implement Sci 13:98, 2018; Black et al, J Health Serv Res Policy 23:158-67, 2018). These pillars were: research environment and receptive contexts; expectations and role clarity; support for participation and inclusive representation and; commitment to the value of co-learning involving institutional leadership.
   Results: Five priority areas were identified by the co-design team for targeted quality improvement initiatives: Collaboration along the integrated care continuum; continence care; improved mobility; access to food and hydration and improved patient information. These priority areas and the responding quality improvement initiatives are discussed in relation to patient-centred outcomes for enhanced care delivery for frail older people in an acute hospital setting.
   Conclusions: The co-design approach to quality improvement places patient-centred outcomes such as dignity, identity, respectful communication as well as independence as key drivers for implementation. Enhanced inter-personal communication was consistently emphasised by the co-design team and much of the quality improvement initiatives target more effective, respectful and clear communication between healthcare personnel and patients. Measurement and evaluation of these patient-centred outcomes, while challenging, should be prioritised in the implementation of quality improvement initiatives. Adequate resourcing and administrative commitment pose the greatest challenges to the sustainability of the interventions developed along the SAFE pathways. The inclusion of organisational leadership in the co-design and implementation teams is a critical factor in the success of interventions targeting service delivery and quality improvement.

We enrolled 150 patients aged under 15 who were clinically diagnosed with HFMD in Dong Thap Hospital, 600 household members, and 581/600 household members completed the study. All participants were interviewed using a standard questionnaire. Throat swabs and blood samples were taken for molecular detection of viruses and assessment of neutralizing antibodies, respectively. Index cases were defined using a clinical case definition, household contact cases were defined using a similar definition applied to the 2 weeks before admission and 2 weeks after discharge of the index case. Characteristics of index cases, household contacts, the attack rate, serotype features and related factors of HFMD were reported. Result Among 150 index cases, 113 were laboratory confirmed: 90/150 were RT-PCR-positive, 101/142 had a >= 4-fold increase of neutralizing antibody against Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71), Coxsackievirus (CV) A6 or CV-A16 across the two samples collected. 80/150 (53%) were males, and 45/150 (30%) were under the age of 1. The predominant serotype was CV-A6, identified in 57/87 (65.5%) of the specimens. No deaths were reported. Among 581 household contacts, 148 were laboratory confirmed: 12/581 were RT-PCR-positive, 142/545 had a >= 4-fold increase of neutralizing antibodies against EV-A71, CV-A6 or CV-A16; 4 cases experienced HFMD in the past 4 weeks. Attack rate among household contacts was 148/581 (25.5%). In 7/12 (58%) instances, the index and secondary cases were infected with the same serotype. Having a relationship to index case was significantly associated with EV infection. Conclusion The attack rate among household contacts was relatively high (25.5%) in this study and it seems justified to also consider the household setting as an additional target for intervention programs.

AB Background Health care workers have a high risk of occupational exposure. However, the risk of occupational exposure for pediatric health care workers has not been acknowledged in previous studies. The purpose of this study was to investigate the occupational exposure rate of pediatric health care workers in Chinese public hospitals, to explore risk factors for occupational exposure, and to put forward corresponding countermeasures to reduce occupational exposure of pediatric health care workers and protect their physical and mental health. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with pediatric health care workers in 43 hospitals in 15 provinces in eastern, central, and western China between July and October 2018. With this sample, we computed the descriptive statistics of the demographic characteristics, calculated the frequency of various types of occupational exposure, and tested risk factors for occupational exposure using a chi-squared test and binary logistic regression analysis. Results Most respondents were nursing staff (61.1%) and workers with a low-ranking professional title (50.5%). The most common style of occupational exposure in our sample was a hazard in the work environment (62.6%). Notably, physicians were less likely to experience occupational exposure than nurses (OR = 0.320, 95% CI = 0.241, 0.426). Meanwhile, pediatric health care workers who interpreted the doctor-patient relationship as harmonious (OR = 0.304, 95% CI = 0.152, 0.607) were less likely to suffer occupational exposure. Conclusion Pediatric health care workers in Chinese public hospitals have a high occupational exposure risk and the risk factors are complex and diverse. The state, society, hospitals should acknowledge this issue and develop strategies to protect the physical and mental health of pediatric health care workers.

TI Voluntary medical male circumcision for HIV prevention among adolescents
   in Kenya: Unintended consequences of pursuing service-delivery targets
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CONSENT; MEN
AB Introduction
   Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) provides significant reductions in the risk of female-to-male HIV transmission. Since 2007, VMMC has been a key component of the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief's (PEPFAR) strategy to mitigate the HIV epidemic in countries with high HIV prevalence and low circumcision rates. To ensure intended effects, PEPFAR sets ambitious annual circumcision targets and provides funding to implementation partners to deliver local VMMC services. In Kenya to date, 1.9 million males have been circumcised; in 2017, 60% of circumcisions were among 10-14-year-olds. We conducted a qualitative field study to learn more about VMMC program implementation in Kenya.
   Methods and results
   The study setting was a region in Kenya with high HIV prevalence and low male circumcision rates. From March 2017 through April 2018, we carried out in-depth interviews with 29 VMMC stakeholders, including "mobilizers", HIV counselors, clinical providers, schoolteachers, and policy professionals. Additionally, we undertook observation sessions at 14 VMMC clinics while services were provided and observed mobilization activities at 13 community venues including, two schools, four public marketplaces, two fishing villages, and five inland villages. Analysis of interview transcripts and observation field notes revealed multiple unintended consequences linked to the pursuit of targets. Ebbs and flows in the availability of school-age youths together with the drive to meet targets may result in increased burdens on clinics, long waits for care, potentially misleading mobilization practices, and deviations from the standard of care.
   Conclusion
   Our findings indicate shortcomings in the quality of procedures in VMMC programs in a low-resource setting, and more importantly, that the pursuit of ambitious public health targets may lead to compromised service delivery and protocol adherence. There is a need to develop improved or alternative systems to balance the goal of increasing service uptake with the responsible conduct of VMMC.

AB Background Adolescent alcohol consumption is an issue of ongoing concern and programs targeting parents have been identified as an important component in minimizing and preventing alcohol related harm in adolescents. This paper aims to evaluate existing parent based alcohol education programs with a focus on understanding parent specific outcomes including parental attitudes, parent-child communication, alcohol specific rule setting and parental monitoring; study quality, the extent of stakeholder engagement in program design and the level of theory application. Method A systematic review of electronic databases EBSCO, Emerald, ProQuest, PubMed, Ovid, ScienceDirect, Taylor and Francis and Web of Science was conducted from database inception to August 2019. A total of 4288 unique records were retrieved from the eight databases. Studies were included if they evaluated school based alcohol education programs that included a parent component and detailed outcome measures associated with parent data. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) quality assessment tool. Results In total 17 studies qualified for assessment, detailing 13 individual parent programs. Of these, ten programs demonstrated positive effects in at least one parent reported outcome measure. Stakeholder engagement during the design of programs was lacking with the majority of programs. One third of the programs did not report theory use and when theory was used reporting was weak with three programs applying theory, five testing theory and none building theory. According to the EPHPP tool, overall ten programs were rated as weak, three as moderate and none as strong. Conclusion Future studies are recommended to further enhance the effectiveness of parental programs by improving study quality, increasing stakeholder engagement and increasing the level of theory application and reporting.

AB BackgroundRoad traffic injuries (RTIs) have been one of the most critical public health problems in Thailand for decades. The objective of this study was to examine to what extent provincial economy was associated with RTIs, road traffic deaths and case fatality rate in Thailand.MethodsA secondary data analysis on time-series data was applied. The unit of analysis was a panel of 77 provinces during 2012-2016. Data were obtained from relevant public authorities, including the Ministry of Public Health. Descriptive statistics and econometric models, using negative binomial (NB) regression, negative binomial regression with random-effects (RE) model, and spatial Durbin model (SDM) were employed. The main predictor variable was gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and the outcome variables were incidence proportion of RTIs, traffic deaths and case fatality rate. The analysis was adjusted for key covariates.ResultsThe incidence proportion of RTIs rose from 449.0 to 524.9 cases per 100,000 population from 2012 till 2016, whereas the incidence of traffic fatalities fluctuated between 29.7 and 33.2 deaths per 100,000 population. Case fatality rate steadily stood at 0.06-0.07 deaths per victim. RTIs and traffic deaths appeared to be positively correlated with provincial economy in the NB regression and the RE model. In the SDM, a log-Baht increase in GDP per capita (equivalent to a growth of GDP per capita by about 2.7 times) enlarged the incidence proportion of injuries and deaths by about a quarter (23.8-30.7%) with statistical significance. No statistical significance was found in case fatality rate by the SDM. The SDM also presented the best model fitness relative to other models.ConclusionThe incidence proportion of traffic injuries and deaths appeared to rise alongside provincial prosperity. This means that RTIs-preventive measures should be more intensified in economically well-off areas. Furthermore, entrepreneurs and business sectors that gain economic benefit in a particular province should share responsibility in RTIs prevention in the area where their businesses are running. Further studies that explore others determinants of road safety, such as patterns of vehicles used, attitudes and knowledge of motorists, investment in safety measures, and compliance with traffic laws, are recommended.

AB Backgound Obesity and dyslipidemia are major risk factors associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD refers to the accumulation of fat in more than 5% of the liver without alcohol consumption. NAFLD is the most common liver disease and is rapidly becoming a global public health problem. Maoberry (Antidesma bunius) is a fruit rich in antioxidants, especially phenolic compounds, which are reported to have benefits for patients with NAFLD. Methods We evaluated the effect of Maoberry extract on fat metabolism in liver tissues of high fat diet-induced rats. Five (5) groups (n = 12) of male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into those given a high fat diet with no treatment (HF), different dosages of Maoberry extracts (0.38 [ML], 0.76 [MM) and 1.52 [MH] g/kg body weight) and 10 mg/kg statin (STAT). The rats were fed a high fat diet for 4 weeks to induce obesity and subsequently continued more for 12 weeks with treatments of Maoberry extracts or STAT. The levels of triglyceride, liver enzymes, oxidative stress and inflammation markers, triglyceride synthesis regulators, and pathology of the liver in high fat diet-induced rats were investigated. Results Feeding Maoberry extract in MH groups resulted in decreasing levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), liver triglyceride, liver thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and mRNA expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT)-1 and acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) compared with the HF group (P < 0.05). Moreover, histopathological study of the liver showed reduced fat droplets in the Maoberry extract treatment groups, especially in MH groups and STAT treatment groups. Conclusions The improvements of fat metabolism in liver tissues of rats fed a high-fat diet were observed in Maoberry extracts treatment groups. The underline mechanism that link to fat metabolism might be through the process accompanied with down-regulated the gene expression of key enzymes of lipid production, antioxidant activity, and anti-inflammation properties of Maoberry extracts which contains high levels of phenolic and flavonoid compounds.

AB Background Diabetes is 7th largest cause of death worldwide, and prevalence is increasing rapidly in low-and middle-income countries. There is an urgent need to develop and test interventions to prevent and control diabetes and develop the theory about how such interventions can be effective. We conducted a participatory learning and action (PLA) intervention with community groups in rural Bangladesh which was evaluated through a cluster randomised controlled trial. There was a large reduction in the combined prevalence of type 2 diabetes and intermediate hyperglycaemia in the PLA group compared with the control group. We present findings from qualitative process evaluation research to explore how this intervention was effective. Methods We conducted group interviews and focus group discussions using photovoice with purposively sampled group attenders and non-attenders, and intervention implementers. Data were collected before the trial analysis. We used inductive content analysis to generate theory from the data. Results The intervention increased the health literacy of individuals and communities - developing their knowledge, capacity and self-confidence to enact healthy behaviours. Community, household and individual capacity increased through social support and social networks, which then created an enabling community context, further strengthening agency and enabling community action. This increased opportunities for healthy behaviour. Community actions addressed lack of awareness about diabetes, gendered barriers to physical activity and lack of access to blood glucose testing. The interaction between the individual, household, and community contexts amplified change, and yet there was limited engagement with macro level, or 'state', barriers to healthy behaviour. Conclusions The participatory approach enabled groups to analyse how context affected their ability to have healthy behaviours and participants engaged with issues as a community in the ways that they felt comfortable. We suggest measuring health literacy and social networks in future interventions and recommend specific capacity strengthening to develop public accountability mechanisms and health systems strengthening to complement community-based interventions.

AB Background Stroke is a major public health concern, affecting millions of people worldwide. Care of the condition however, remain inconsistent in developing countries. The purpose of this scoping review was to document evidence of stroke care and service delivery in low and middle-income countries to better inform development of a context-fit stroke model of care. Methods An interpretative scoping literature review based on Arksey and O'Malley's five-stage-process was executed. The following databases searched for literature published between 2010 and 2017; Cochrane Library, Credo Reference, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, Science Direct, BioMed Central, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINNAHL), Academic Search Complete, and Google Scholar. Single combined search terms included acute stroke, stroke care, stroke rehabilitation, developing countries, low and middle-income countries. Results A total of 177 references were identified. Twenty of them, published between 2010 and 2017, were included in the review. Applying the Donebedian Model of quality of care, seven dimensions of stroke-care structure, six dimensions of stroke care processes, and six dimensions of stroke care outcomes were identified. Structure of stroke care included availability of a stroke unit, an accident and emergency department, a multidisciplinary team, stroke specialists, neuroimaging, medication, and health care policies. Stroke care processes that emerged were assessment and diagnosis, referrals, intravenous thrombolysis, rehabilitation, and primary and secondary prevention strategies. Stroke-care outcomes included quality of stroke-care practice, functional independence level, length of stay, mortality, living at home, and institutionalization. Conclusions There is lack of uniformity in the way stroke care is advanced in low and middle-income countries. This is reflected in the unsatisfactory stroke care structure, processes, and outcomes. There is a need for stroke care settings to adopt quality improvement strategies. Health ministry and governments need to decisively face stroke burden by setting policies that advance improved care of patients with stroke. Stroke Units and Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator (rtPA) administration could be considered as both a structural and process necessity towards improvement of outcomes of patients with stroke in the LMICs.

AB Background In Uruguay it is mandatory to review all cases of positive HIV or reactive syphilis tests in pregnancy and peripartum. We compared the rates of mother-to-child transmission of syphilis and HIV detected by case reviews to those obtained from the usual surveillance system and described the characteristic of vertical transmission cases. Methods This is a cross-sectional study performed with secondary data obtained from official government sources, for all the country cases of maternal to child transmission of HIV and syphilis from 2012 to 2017, with descriptive analyses. For congenital syphilis analyses, the following pregnancy characteristics were investigated: number of antenatal checks, gestational age at pregnancy diagnosis, gestational age at syphilis test and diagnosis, adequate treatment, and treatment of partners. Sociodemographic characteristics included type of health care (public/private), maternal age, distribution of ethnic minorities, maximum educational attainment, presence of partner, planned pregnancy, drug and alcohol use, domestic violence, previous maternal diagnosis of syphilis, and previous children with congenital syphilis. Results Coverage of syphilis case reviews increased from 82% in 2014 to 97.4% in 2017. For HIV, this coverage reached 100% in 2017 and elimination of mother to child transmission was achieved. A marked decline in congenital syphilis was noted in the public health care sector, especially in the capital Montevideo, whereas the private sector has remained below the elimination target. Variables related with congenital syphilis in exposed children were late pregnancy diagnosis, < 5 antenatal checks, delayed diagnosis of gestational syphilis, lower rate of correct treatment for gestational syphilis, untreated partner, low maternal schooling, unplanned pregnancy, history of syphilis, and having other children with syphilis. Conclusion The use of case reviews provided knowledge regarding the accurate number of mother-to-child transmission cases and the evolution of elimination of mother to child transmission in the country. The results suggest that rates must be adjusted, providing an opportunity to improve the reliability of surveillance data, and point the need to address specific gaps in order to improve the quality of care during pregnancy, delivery, and the neonatal period.

AB Background: Chronic musculoskeletal pain affects more than 20% of the population, and the prevalence is increasing, causing suffering, loss of quality of life, disability, and an enormous expenditure on healthcare resources. The most common location for chronic pain is the spine. Many of the treatments used are mainly passive (pharmacological and invasive) and poor outcomes. The treatments currently applied in the public health system do not comply with the recommendations of the main clinical practice guidelines, which suggest the use of educational measures and physical exercise as the first-line treatment. A protocol based on active coping strategies is described, which will be evaluated through a clinical trial and which could facilitate the transfer of the recommendations of the clinical practice guidelines to a primary care setting.
   Methods: Randomised and multicentre clinical trials, which will be carried out in 10 Primary Care centres. The trial will compare the effect of a Pain Neuroscience Education program (six sessions, 10 h) and group physical exercise (18 sessions program carried out in six weeks, 18 h), with usual care physiotherapy treatment. Group physical exercise incorporates dual tasks, gaming, and reinforcement of contents of the educational program. The aim is to assess the effect of the intervention on quality of life, as well as on pain, disability, catastrophism, kinesiophobia, central sensitisation, and drug use. The outcome variables will be measured at the beginning of the intervention, after the intervention (week 11), at six months, and a year.
   Discussion: Therapeutic interventions based on active coping strategies are essential for the treatment of chronic pain and the sustainability of the Public Health System. Demonstrating whether group interventions have an effect size is essential for optimising resources in such a prevalent problem.

TI Inadequate conflict of interest policies at most French teaching
   hospitals: A survey and website analysis
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MEDICAL-STUDENTS ATTITUDES; PHARMACEUTICAL-INDUSTRY; PHYSICIANS; GIFTS;
   EXPOSURE
AB Background
   There are 32 teaching hospitals in France, including 30 University hospitals and two Regional teaching hospitals. Teaching hospitals have three roles: health care provision, training of healthcare professionals, and medical research. These roles lead to frequent interactions with pharmaceutical and medical device companies, inevitably raising risks of conflicts of interests. Therefore, policies to manage conflict of interests (C01) are crucial. This study aims to examine COI policies in French teaching hospitals.
   Methods
   All French teaching hospitals (n = 32) were included in this study. All hospitals websites were screened for institutional COI policies and curriculum on COI, using standardized keyword searches. More data were collected through a questionnaire addressed to each chief executive officer (CEO) of the teaching hospital. We used predefined criteria (n = 20) inspired by similar surveys on COI policies in French, US and Canadian medical schools, with some additions to reflect the local hospital context. A global score for each hospital, ranging from 0 to 60 (higher scores denoting stronger policies) was calculated by summing points obtained for each criterion.
   Results
   All 32 hospitals had websites; 21 hospitals listed policies or regulations on their websites or provided them on request. In December 2017, 17 (53.1%) had rules and regulations for some items only, four of which (12.5%) have considered implementing a policy, and only two (6.3%) have begun implementation. 15 (46.9%) had no evidence of COI policies and a null score. The maximum score was 24 out of 60.
   Conclusion
   This is the first systematic assessment of COI policies in teaching hospitals in France. Such policies are needed to protect patients, clinicians and students from undue commercial influence. Despite public and political pressure for better management of COI, few teaching hospitals have implemented comprehensive and protective policies, and some hospitals lacked policies altogether. These results highlight the need for greater attention to management of COI within teaching hospitals. One potential solution would be to integrate COI policies into hospital accreditation procedures, in order to ensure a baseline of management at all teaching hospitals.

AB Food allergies are severe immune responses to plant and animal products mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE). Peanuts (Arachis hypogaea L.) are among the top 15 crops that feed the world. However, peanuts is among the "big eight food allergens", and allergies induced by peanuts are a significant public health problem and a life-threatening concern. Targeted mutation studies in peanuts demonstrate that single residue alterations in these allergen proteins could result in substantial reduction in allergenicity. Knowledge of peanut allergen proteins is confined to the allotetraploid crop and its two progenitors. We explored frequencies and positions of natural mutations in the hyperallergenic homologues Ara h 2 and Ara h 6 in newly generated sequences for 24 Arachis wild species and the crop species, assessed potential mutational impact on allergenicity using immunoblots and structural modeling, and evaluated whether these mutations follow evolutionary trends. We uncovered a wealth of natural mutations, both substitutions and gaps, including the elimination of immunodominant epitopes in some species. These molecular alterations appear to be associated with substantial reductions in allergenicity. The study demonstrated that Ara h 2 and Ara h 6 follow contrasting modes of natural selection and opposing mutational patterns, particularly in epitope regions. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a progressive trend towards immunodominant epitope evolution in Ara h2. The findings provide valuable insight into the interactions among mutations, protein structure and immune system response, thus presenting a valuable platform for future manipulation of allergens to minimize, treat or eliminate allergenicity. The study strongly encourages exploration of genepools of economically important plants in allergenicity research.

AB Background
   Prostate cancer is a major public health issue, mainly because patients relapse after androgen deprivation therapy. Proteomic strategies, aiming to reflect the functional activity of cells, are nowadays among the leading approaches to tackle the challenges not only of better diagnosis, but also of unraveling mechanistic details related to disease etiology and progression.
   Methods
   We conducted here a large SILAC-based Mass Spectrometry experiment to map the proteomes and phosphoproteomes of four widely used prostate cell lines, namely PNT1A, LNCaP, DU145 and PC3, representative of different cancerous and hormonal status.
   Results
   We identified more than 3000 proteins and phosphosites, from which we quantified more than 1000 proteins and 500 phosphosites after stringent filtering. Extensive exploration of this proteomics and phosphoproteomics dataset allowed characterizing housekeeping as well as cell-line specific proteins, phosphosites and functional features of each cell line. In addition, by comparing the sensitive and resistant cell lines, we identified protein and phosphosites differentially expressed in the resistance context. Further data integration in a molecular network highlighted the differentially expressed pathways, in particular migration and invasion, RNA splicing, DNA damage repair response and transcription regulation.
   Conclusions
   Overall, this study proposes a valuable resource toward the characterization of proteome and phosphoproteome of four widely used prostate cell lines and reveals candidates to be involved in prostate cancer progression for further experimental validation.

AB Despite a very effective vaccine, active conflict and community distrust during the ongoing DRC Ebola epidemic are undermining control efforts, including a ring vaccination strategy that requires the prompt immunization of close contacts of infected individuals. However, in April 2019, it was reported 20% or more of close contacts cannot be reached or refuse vaccination, and it is predicted that the ring vaccination strategy would not be effective with such a high level of inaccessibility. The vaccination strategy is now incorporating a "third ring" community-level vaccination that targets members of communities even if they are not known contacts of Ebola cases. To assess the impact of vaccination strategies for controlling Ebola epidemics in the context of variable levels of community accessibility, we employed an individual-level stochastic transmission model that incorporates four sources of heterogeneity: a proportion of the population is inaccessible for contact tracing and vaccination due to lack of confidence in interventions or geographic inaccessibility, two levels of population mixing resembling household and community transmission, two types of vaccine doses with different time periods until immunity, and transmission rates that depend on spatial distance. Our results indicate that a ring vaccination strategy alone would not be effective for containing the epidemic in the context of significant delays to vaccinating contacts even for low levels of household inaccessibility and affirm the positive impact of a supplemental community vaccination strategy. Our key results are that as levels of inaccessibility increase, there is a qualitative change in the effectiveness of the vaccination strategy. For higher levels of vaccine access, the probability that the epidemic will end steadily increases over time, even if probabilities are lower than they would be otherwise with full community participation. For levels of vaccine access that are too low, however, the vaccination strategies are not expected to be successful in ending the epidemic even though they help lower incidence levels, which saves lives, and makes the epidemic easier to contain and reduces spread to other communities. This qualitative change occurs for both types of vaccination strategies: ring vaccination is effective for containing an outbreak until the levels of inaccessibility exceeds approximately 10% in the context of significant delays to vaccinating contacts, a combined ring and community vaccination strategy is effective until the levels of inaccessibility exceeds approximately 50%. More broadly, our results underscore the need to enhance community engagement to public health interventions in order to enhance the effectiveness of control interventions to ensure outbreak containment.
   Author summary In the context of the ongoing Ebola epidemic in DRC, active conflict and community distrust are undermining control efforts, including vaccination strategies. In this paper, we employed an individual-level stochastic structured transmission model to assess the impact of vaccination strategies on epidemic control in the context of variable levels of household inaccessibility. We found that a ring vaccination strategy of close contacts would not be effective for containing the epidemic in the context of significant delays to vaccinating contacts even for low levels of household inaccessibility and evaluate the impact of a supplemental community vaccination strategy. For lower levels of inaccessibility, the probability of epidemic containment increases over time. For higher levels of inaccessibility, even the combined ring and community vaccination strategies are not expected to contain the epidemic even though they help lower incidence levels, which saves lives, makes the epidemic easier to contain and reduces spread to other communities. We found that ring vaccination is effective for containing an outbreak until the levels of inaccessibility exceeds approximately 10%, a combined ring and community vaccination strategy is effective until the levels of inaccessibility exceeds approximately 50%. Our findings underscore the need to enhance community engagement to public health interventions.

AB Background Aedes aegypti is a vector mosquito of major public health importance, transmitting arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) such as chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever and Zika viruses. Wild mosquito populations are persistently infected at high prevalence with insect-specific viruses that do not replicate in vertebrate hosts. In experimental settings, acute infections with insect-specific viruses have been shown to modulate arbovirus infection and transmission in Ae. aegypti and other vector mosquitoes. However, the impact of persistent insect-specific virus infections, which arboviruses encounter more commonly in nature, has not been investigated extensively. Cell lines are useful models for studying virus-host interactions, however the available Ae. aegypti cell lines are poorly defined and heterogenous cultures. Methodology/Principle findings We generated single cell-derived clonal cell lines from the commonly used Ae. aegypti cell line Aag2. Two of the fourteen Aag2-derived clonal cell lines generated harboured markedly and consistently reduced levels of the insect-specific bunyavirus Phasi Charoen-like virus (PCLV) known to persistently infect Aag2 cells. In contrast to studies with acute insect-specific virus infections in cell culture and in vivo, we found that pre-existing persistent PCLV infection had no major impact on the replication of the flaviviruses dengue virus and Zika virus, the alphavirus Sindbis virus, or the rhabdovirus vesicular stomatitis virus. We also performed a detailed characterisation of the morphology, transfection efficiency and immune status of our Aag2-derived clonal cell lines, and have made a clone that we term Aag2-AF5 available to the research community as a well-defined cell culture model for arbovirus-vector interaction studies.
   Author summary Mosquito-borne viruses usually only infect humans through the bite of a mosquito that carries the virus. Viruses transmitted by the 'yellow fever mosquito' Aedes aegypti, including dengue virus, Zika virus, yellow fever virus and chikungunya virus, are causing an ever-increasing number of human disease cases globally. Mosquito-borne viruses have to infect and replicate inside the mosquito before they are transmitted to humans, and the presence of other infectious agents can change the efficiency of virus transmission. Mosquitoes are known to be infected with 'insect-specific viruses' that only infect mosquitoes and cannot cause human disease. We have shown here that in laboratory cell cultures derived from the Aedes aegypti mosquito, pre-existing infection with an insect-specific virus called Phasi Charoen-like virus does not affect the infection and growth of the mosquito-borne viruses dengue virus, Zika virus, Sindbis virus or vesicular stomatitis virus. Our research provides important new insights into whether and how insect-specific viruses may affect mosquito-borne virus replication. Ultimately, this information could inform ongoing research into whether insect-specific viruses could be used to prevent the transmission of mosquito-borne viruses to reduce global disease burdens.

AB Dengue fever is endemic in Malaysia, contributing to significant economic and health burden in the country. Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus are the main vectors of the dengue virus (DENV), which circulates in sylvatic and human transmission cycles and has been present in Malaysia for decades. The study investigated the presence and distribution of DENV in urban localities in the Klang Valley, Peninsular Malaysia. A total of 364 Ae. aegypti and 1,025 Ae. albopictus larvae, and 10 Ae. aegypti and 42 Ae. albopictus adult mosquitoes were screened for the presence of DENV. In total, 31 (2.2%) samples were positive, of which 2 Ae. albopictus larvae were co-infected with two serotypes, one with DENV-2 and DENV-3 and the other with DENV-3 and DENV-4. Phylogenetic analysis determined that the isolates belonged to DENV-1 genotype I (1 Ae. aegypti adult), DENV-2 (1 Ae. albopictus larva), DENV-3 genotype V (3 Ae. aegypti larvae and 10 Ae. albopictus larvae) and DENV-4 genotype IV (6 Ae. aegypti larvae and 12 Ae. albopictus larvae), a sylvatic strain of DENV-4 which was most closely related with sylvatic strains isolated from arboreal mosquitoes and sentinel monkeys in Peninsular Malaysia in the 1970s. All four DENV serotypes were co-circulating throughout the study period. The detection of a sylvatic strain of DENV-4 in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes in urban areas in Peninsular Malaysia highlights the susceptibility of these vectors to infection with sylvatic DENV. The infectivity and vector competence of these urban mosquitoes to this strain of the virus needs further investigation, as well as the possibility of the emergence of sylvatic virus into the human transmission cycle.
   Author summary Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease that has re-emerged as a major public health problem in the 21(st) Century. The four serotypes of dengue virus are capable of infecting humans with a range of symptoms and clinical outcomes, with the change in predominating serotypes often responsible for new dengue outbreaks. In this study, we surveyed urban sites in the Klang Valley, Malaysia, for Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquito vectors and confirmed the presence of all four serotypes of the virus. We detected the presence of genotype V of dengue serotype 3, which has previously not been reported in the country, as well as a sylvatic strain of dengue serotype 4 that was closely related to strains obtained from forest-dwelling mosquito vectors and sentinel monkeys in Malaysia. The detection of a sylvatic strain of dengue virus in urban vectors raises questions over the risk of virus transmission to humans, especially with recent reports of severe clinical cases as a result of infection with sylvatic dengue virus serotypes. Further studies will be needed to determine the source and origins of these strains as well as the severity of dengue disease upon infection, especially with the development of new dengue vaccines.

AB Despite efforts made over decades by the Peruvian government to eliminate malaria, Plasmodium vivax remains a challenge for public health decision-makers in the country. The uneven distribution of its incidence, plus its complex pattern of dispersion, has made ineffective control measures based on global information that lack the necessary detail to understand transmission fully. In this sense, population genetic tools can complement current surveillance. This study describes the genetic diversity and population structure from September 2012 to March 2015 in three geographically distant settlements, Cahuide (CAH), Lupuna (LUP) and Santa Emilia (STE), located in the Peruvian Amazon. A total 777 P. vivax mono-infections, out of 3264, were genotyped. Among study areas, LUP showed 19.7% of polyclonal infections, and its genetic diversity (H-exp) was 0.544. Temporal analysis showed a significant increment of polyclonal infections and H-exp, and the introduction and persistence of a new parasite population since March 2013. In STE, 40.1% of infections were polyclonal, with H-exp = 0.596. The presence of four genetic clusters without signals of clonal expansion and infections with lower parasite densities compared against the other two areas were also found. At least four parasite populations were present in CAH in 2012, where, after June 2014, malaria cases decreased from 213 to 61, concomitant with a decrease in polyclonal infections (from 0.286 to 0.18), and expectedly variable H-exp. Strong signals of gene flow were present in the study areas and wide geographic distribution of highly diverse parasite populations were found. This study suggests that movement of malaria parasites by human reservoirs connects geographically distant malaria transmission areas in the Peruvian Amazon. The maintenance of high levels of parasite genetic diversity through human mobility is a critical barrier to malaria elimination in this region.
   Author summary Plasmodium vivax transmission is heterogeneous and discontinuous in the Peruvian Amazon. Such heterogeneity is the result of factors that include, but are not restricted to, the environment, public policies, and characteristics of the parasite, the vector, and human activities. All these factors make P. vivax transmission resilient to interventions. In order to achieve the goals of control and local elimination, P. vivax surveillance must inform how those factors sustain disease transmission in order to focalize and synchronize control strategies. In this study, we implemented molecular surveillance complemented with population genetic tools in the areas of Cahuide, Lupuna, and Santa Emilia located in the Peruvian Amazon. In particular, we characterize the transmission and the parasite genetic variation in these sites from September 2012 to March 2015. The changes in parasite diversity, the wide geographic dispersion of parasite subpopulation and the introduction of a new parasite clone or subpopulation in Lupuna documented in this study suggest that connectivity among the different endemic areas, likely due to human mobility, sustains disease transmission in the region hindering the success of control measures. This information must be considered in the design of current control strategies.

AB Introduction Skin diseases represent a significant public health problem in most low and middle income settings. Nevertheless, there is a relative paucity of high-quality epidemiological data on the prevalence of these conditions. Materials/Methods We conducted two cross-sectional population-based skin-surveys of children (6 months to 9 years old) in the Bijagos Archipelago of Guinea-Bissau during the dry season (February-March 2018) and the wet season (June-July 2018). Following a period of training, a nurse performed a standardised examination for communicable dermatoses for each participant. We calculated the prevalence of each skin condition and investigated demographic associations. Results 1062 children were enrolled in the dry season survey of whom 318 (29.9%) had at least one skin diseases. The most common diagnosis was tinea capitis (154/1062, 14.5% - 95% CI 12.5-16.8%) followed by tinea corporis (84/1062, 7.9% - 95% CI 6.4-9.7%), pyoderma (82/1062, 7.7% - 95% CI 6.2-9.5%) and scabies (56/1062. 5.2% - 95%CI 4.0-6.8%). 320 children were enrolled in the wet season survey of whom 121 (37.8%) had at least one skin problem. Tinea capitis remained the most common diagnosis (79/320, 24.7% - 95% CI 20.1-29.9%), followed by pyoderma (38/320, 11.9% - 95% CI 8.6-16.1%), tinea corporis (23/320, 7.2% - 95% 4.7-10.7%) and scabies (6/320, 1.9% - 95% CI 0.8-4.2%). Conclusions Our study, which utilised robust population-based cluster random sampling methodology, demonstrates the substantial disease burden caused by common communicable dermatoses in this setting. Given these findings, there is a need to consider common dermatoses as part of Universal Health Coverage to deliver 'skin-health for all'.
   Author summary Skin conditions are very common in many low and middle income settings but there have been relatively few surveys of skin disease conducted using the best epidemiological approaches. We performed two cross-sectional population-based skin-surveys of children in the Bijagos Archipelago, Guinea-Bissau, using gold-standard sampling methodologies. Skin conditions were extremely common and almost 30% of children had at least one common, infectious skin condition in both surveys. Fungal skin and scalp infections were the most common conditions followed by bacterial skin infections. Our survey demonstrates that common, easily treatable skin conditions are responsible for a high burden of disease in this population. Skin-health should be considered a key component of the Universal Health Coverage agenda.

AB Background Acute febrile illness (AFI), a common reason for people seeking medical care globally, represents a spectrum of infectious disease etiologies with important variations geographically and by population. There is no standardized approach to conducting AFI etiologic investigations, limiting interpretation of data in a global context. We conducted a scoping review to characterize current AFI research methodologies, identify global research gaps, and provide methodological research standardization recommendations. Methodology/Findings Using pre-defined terms, we searched Medline, Embase, and Global Health, for publications from January 1, 2005-December 31, 2017. Publications cited in previously published systematic reviews and an online study repository of non-malarial febrile illness etiologies were also included. We screened abstracts for publications reporting on human infectious disease, aimed at determining AFI etiology using laboratory diagnostics. One-hundred ninety publications underwent full-text review, using a standardized tool to collect data on study characteristics, methodology, and laboratory diagnostics. AFI case definitions between publications varied: use of self-reported fever as part of case definitions (28%, 53/190), fever cut-off value (38 center dot 0 degrees C most commonly used: 45%, 85/190), and fever measurement site (axillary most commonly used: 19%, 36/190). Eighty-nine publications (47%) did not include exclusion criteria, and inclusion criteria in 13% (24/190) of publications did not include age group. No publications included study settings in Southern Africa, Micronesia & Polynesia, or Central Asia. We summarized standardized reporting practices, specific to AFI etiologic investigations that would increase inter-study comparability. Conclusions Wider implementation of standardized AFI reporting methods, with multi-pathogen disease detection, could improve comparability of study findings, knowledge of the range of AFI etiologies, and their contributions to the global AFI burden. These steps can guide resource allocation, strengthen outbreak detection and response, target prevention efforts, and improve clinical care, especially in resource-limited settings where disease control often relies on empiric treatment. PROSPERO: CRD42016035666.
   Author summary Acute febrile illness (AFI) is a common reason for people seeking medical care globally with potentially serious infectious etiologies. However, AFI has no current consensus standardized approach when considered as a syndromic case definition for public health surveillance or research, especially in global settings where AFI treatment is performed with limited diagnostic availability. Therefore, the aim of this review was to describe current methodologies in AFI research, identify gaps in research, and provide recommendations for standardization of AFI research. We screened abstracts and completed full-text reviews on publications found through an extensive search. A total of 190 publications were included in the final review, from which we collected data on study characteristics, methodology, and laboratory diagnostics. These collected data elements allowed us to identify where there were inconsistencies in reporting and investigative methods, which data elements were not regularly collected, and what laboratory testing methods were commonly used. Standardized reporting methods for AFI investigations, along with laboratory testing capacity for multiple pathogens, can improve our knowledge of the causative agents of AFI in certain regions of the world. This can help us determine where resources are needed, how to strengthen outbreak detection and response, and how to improve medical care, especially in regions with limited resources.

AB Author summary Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and has caused explosive epidemics in Asia and the Americas since 2004. During mosquito infection, the CHIKV genome replicates with a high mutation rate to produce virus populations with high genetic diversity that facilitate virus evolution. With this study, we address three gaps in knowledge: 1) are Ae. aegypti mosquitoes from Los Angeles, California, capable of transmitting CHIKV, 2) what effect does increased CHIKV population diversity have on virus infection and transmission by mosquitoes, and 3) are there constraints to CHIKV evolution in mosquitoes? We use oral infection of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes originating from Los Angeles, California to demonstrate high laboratory transmission competence of CHIKV. We also show that oral infection of mosquitoes with CHIKV variants that produce more diverse populations are less able to infect mosquitoes than wildtype CHIKV populations. Lastly, our study provides evidence of genome-wide and regional constraints to CHIKV evolution within Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Our results will inform public health risk assessments for potential CHIKV introduction in southern California and advance our understanding of the role of mosquitoes in CHIKV evolution.
   Chikungunya virus (Togaviridae, Alphavirus; CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne global health threat that has been transmitted transiently in the southeastern United States. A primary CHIKV mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, was recently established in the populous state of California, but the vector competence of Californian mosquitoes is unknown. Explosive CHIKV epidemics since 2004 have been associated with the acquisition of mosquito-adaptive mutations that enhance transmission by Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus. As a highly mutable RNA virus, CHIKV has the potential for extensive and rapid genetic diversification in vertebrate hosts and mosquito vectors. We previously demonstrated that expansion of CHIKV diversity in cell culture allows for greater adaptability to novel selection pressures, and that CHIKV fidelity variants are able to diversify more than wildtype (WT) CHIKV in mice. The evolution of intra-vector CHIKV populations and the correlation between CHIKV population diversity and infectivity and transmissibility in mosquitoes has not yet been studied. Here, we address these gaps in knowledge via experimental infection of Ae. aegypti from California with WT and fidelity variant CHIKV. We show that Ae. aegypti from California are highly competent vectors for CHIKV. We also report that CHIKV fidelity variants diversify more than WT in mosquitoes and exhibit attenuated infectivity at the level of the midgut. Furthermore, we demonstrate that intra-vector populations of CHIKV are subjected to purifying selection in mosquito bodies, and sequences of non-coding CHIKV regions are highly conserved. These findings will inform public health risk assessment for CHIKV in California and improve our understanding of constraints to CHIKV evolution in mosquitoes.

TI Discovery of a small molecule inhibitor targeting dengue virus NS5

DT Article
ID PROTEASE INHIBITOR; EXPRESSION; SEQUENCE; MODEL
AB Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection that has spread globally in recent years. Around half of the world's population, especially in the tropics and subtropics, is at risk of infection. Every year, 50-100 million clinical cases are reported, and more than 500,000 patients develop the symptoms of severe dengue infection: dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, which threaten life in Asia and Latin America. No antiviral drug for dengue is available. The dengue virus (DENV) non-structural protein 5 (NS5), which possesses the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity and is responsible for viral replication and transcription, is an attractive target for anti-dengue drug development. In the present study, 16,240 small-molecule compounds in a fragment library were screened for their capabilities to inhibit the DENV type 2 (DENV2) RdRp activities in vitro. Based on in cellulo antiviral and cytotoxity assays, we selected the compound RK-0404678 with the EC50 value of 6.0 mu M for DENV2. Crystallographic analyses revealed two unique binding sites for RK-0404678 within the RdRp, which are conserved in flavivirus NS5 proteins. No resistant viruses emerged after nine rounds of serial passage of DENV2 in the presence of RK-0404678, suggesting the high genetic barrier of this compound to the emergence of a resistant virus. Collectively, RK-0404678 and its binding sites provide a new framework for antiviral drug development.
   Author summary Dengue is a mosquito-borne infection caused by dengue viruses (DENV), and is currently a major public health concern worldwide. No antiviral drug for dengue is available. To develop a potent inhibitor of the DENV NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), we performed a high-throughput screening of a fragment library. We identified RK-0404678 as a potent inhibitor of the DENV RdRp. Interestingly, we found that RK-0404678 binds to two distinct sites in the DENV RdRp domains. Site 1 lies in the thumb domain, which is distant from the active site, and Site 2 is located in the active site of the RdRp domain. RK-0404678 binding to Site 2 induces a conformational change around the Tyr607 residue. These are unique features among the known RdRp inhibitors. In addition, our adaptation experiment demonstrated that this compound imposed a high genetic barrier to the emergence of an RK-0404678-resistant virus. These characteristics of RK-0404678 suggest that this inhibitor is a promising lead compound for the development of anti-dengue therapeutics.

AB Author summary Ascariasis is considered a major problem for the public health system, which has an estimated 800 million infected people worldwide. It occurs in the United States, Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and is generally associated with poverty and precarious health conditions. Pulmonary fibrosis affects 14-63 people per 100,000 habitants/year, and is characterized by collagen deposition and alveolar wall thickening. The comorbidities caused by infections are commonly associated with pulmonary fibrosis exacerbations, poor prognosis, and high mortality. Despite the comorbidities caused by helminth infections, which display a pulmonary parasitic cycle such as that of Ascaris, there is no evidence relating to pulmonary fibrosis progression, possibly because Ascariasis is considered a neglected disease. We evaluated the role of Ascaris during pulmonary fibrosis. We considered two simple questions: (1) Whether Ascaris infection could protect or aggravate fibrosis (comorbidities) and (2) whether pulmonary fibrosis could change the cycle of Ascaris as a result of increased alveolar thickening, larvae retention, and the limitation of influx into airways. We answered both questions as follows: (1) Ascaris infection exacerbates pulmonary and liver injury and inflammation, but not fibrosis; and (2) Pulmonary fibrosis did not alter the course of Ascaris cycle in lungs during transmigration into airways, because Ascaris preferentially seeks and penetrates into the lung areas, which are thought to be preserved, but not into fibrotic areas.
   Ascariasis is considered the most neglected tropical disease, and is a major problem for the public health system. However, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a result of chronic extracellular deposition of matrix in the pulmonary parenchyma, and thickening of the alveolar septa, which reduces alveolar gas exchange. Considering the high rates of ascariasis and pulmonary fibrosis, we believe that these two diseases may co-exist and possibly lead to comorbidities. We therefore investigated the mechanisms involved in comorbidity of Ascaris suum (A. suum) infection, which could interfere with the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. In addition, we evaluated whether a previous lung fibrosis could interfere with the pulmonary cycle of A. suum in mice. The most important findings related to comorbidity in which A. suum infection exacerbated pulmonary and liver injury, inflammation and dysfunction, but did not promote excessive fibrosis in mice during the investigated comorbidity period. Interestingly, we found that pulmonary fibrosis did not alter the parasite cycle that transmigrated preferentially through preserved but not fibrotic areas of the lungs. Collectively, our results demonstrate that A. suum infection leads to comorbidity, and contributes to the aggravation of pulmonary dysfunction during pulmonary fibrosis, which also leads to significant liver injury and inflammation, without changing the A. suum cycle in the lungs.

AB Author summary Lymphatic filariasis is a parasitic disease that can cause incapacity and chronic complications. The World Health Organization aims to eliminate lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem worldwide by 2020. Four municipalities in the Metropolitan Region of Recife (Brazil) are endemic, of which three have undergone mass drug administration (MDA). However, the epidemiological status of filariasis in nine adjoining areas is unknown. Therefore, a literature review was conducted to identify reports of the vector and human cases in these nine municipalities. A review of data starting in 1967 from eight scientific reports highlighted the circulation of microfilaremia, infection of Culex quinquefasciatus with Wuchereria bancrofti, and morbidity owing to lymphatic filariasis. However, no surveillance was proposed in these areas. Therefore, in 2016, a survey of 17,222 children aged 6-10 years and enrolled in urban schools in the nine municipalities was conducted. One child from a municipality in which MDA was conducted tested positive for lymphatic filariasis, but no other case was diagnosed in her family. Our results showed no transmission of lymphatic filariasis in these nine municipalities. However, population migration and socioenvironmental conditions that favor mosquito breeding grounds indicate the need for surveillance in these areas.
   Background The objective of the Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) is to phase out this endemic disease as a public health problem by 2020. Validation of elimination is obtained from the World Health Organization through evidence of non-transmission in countries that have already been subjected to mass drug administration (MDA) and in places adjoining these endemic areas. While three municipalities in Brazil have completed MDA, the epidemiological situation remains uncertain in nine adjoining municipalities. To determine the epidemiological status, this study was to perform a review of the literature and a school-based survey to describe the past and recent endemicity of lymphatic filariasis (LF) theses nine municipalities in Brazil. Methodology/Principle findings For review of the literature, both formal and informal literature sources were accessed since the first reports of filariasis in the Metropolitan Region of Recife, Brazil. We conducted a school-based survey in 2016 using immunochromatographic card tests (ICTs) among schoolchildren aged 6-10 years living in nine municipalities contiguous with the endemic areas in which MDA was conducted. Our review of the literature identified eight studies involving surveys demonstrating that microfilariae had been circulating in eight of the municipalities since 1967, with a low prevalence of microfilaremia, isolated autochthonous cases, and treatment of individual cases. The school-based survey included 17,222 children in 185 urban schools in the nine areas of Brazil with uncertain endemicity. One child affected by allochthonous transmission was antigen positive based on ICT and lived in a municipality adjacent to Recife; this child's family came from Recife, but no other case was diagnosed within the family.

AB Novel infectious diseases continue to emerge within human populations. Predictive studies have begun to identify pathogen traits associated with emergence. However, emerging pathogens vary widely in virulence, a key determinant of their ultimate risk to public health. Here, we use structured literature searches to review the virulence of each of the 214 known human-infective RNA virus species. We then use a machine learning framework to determine whether viral virulence can be predicted by ecological traits, including human-to-human transmissibility, transmission routes, tissue tropisms, and host range. Using severity of clinical disease as a measurement of virulence, we identified potential risk factors using predictive classification tree and random forest ensemble models. The random forest approach predicted literature-assigned disease severity of test data with mean accuracy of 89.4% compared to a null accuracy of 74.2%. In addition to viral taxonomy, the ability to cause systemic infection was the strongest predictor of severe disease. Further notable predictors of severe disease included having neural and/or renal tropism, direct contact or respiratory transmission, and limited (0 < R-0 <= 1) human-to-human transmissibility. We present a novel, to our knowledge, comparative perspective on the virulence of all currently known human RNA virus species. The risk factors identified may provide novel perspectives in understanding the evolution of virulence and elucidating molecular virulence mechanisms. These risk factors could also improve planning and preparedness in public health strategies as part of a predictive framework for novel human infections.

AB What do "microbes" have to do with social equity? These microorganisms are integral to our health, that of our natural environment, and even the "health" of the environments we build. The loss, gain, and retention of microorganisms-their flow between humans and the environment-can greatly impact our health. It is well-known that inequalities in access to perinatal care, healthy foods, quality housing, and the natural environment can create and arise from social inequality. Here, we focus on the argument that access to beneficial microorganisms is a facet of public health, and health inequality may be compounded by inequitable microbial exposure.

AB Background Maternal smoking during pregnancy is an established risk factor for low infant birth weight, but evidence on critical exposure windows and timing of fetal growth restriction is limited. Here we investigate the associations of maternal quitting, reducing, and continuing smoking during pregnancy with longitudinal fetal growth by triangulating evidence from 3 analytical approaches to strengthen causal inference. Methods and findings We analysed data from 8,621 European liveborn singletons in 2 population-based pregnancy cohorts (the Generation R Study, the Netherlands 2002-2006 [n = 4,682]) and the Born in Bradford study, United Kingdom 2007-2010 [n = 3,939]) with fetal ultrasound and birth anthropometric measures, parental smoking during pregnancy, and maternal genetic data. Associations with trajectories of estimated fetal weight (EFW) and individual fetal parameters (head circumference, femur length [FL], and abdominal circumference [AC]) from 12-16 to 40 weeks' gestation were analysed using multilevel fractional polynomial models. We compared results from (1) confounder-adjusted multivariable analyses, (2) a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using maternal rs1051730 genotype as an instrument for smoking quantity and ease of quitting, and (3) a negative control analysis comparing maternal and mother's partner's smoking associations. In multivariable analyses, women who continued smoking during pregnancy had a smaller fetal size than non-smokers from early gestation (16-20 weeks) through to birth (p-value for each parameter < 0.001). Fetal size reductions in continuing smokers followed a dose-dependent pattern (compared to non-smokers, difference in mean EFW [95% CI] at 40 weeks' gestation was -144 g [-182 to -106], -215 g [-248 to -182], and -290 g [-334 to -247] for light, moderate, and heavy smoking, respectively). Overall, fetal size reductions were most pronounced for FL. The fetal growth trajectory in women who quit smoking in early pregnancy was similar to that of non-smokers, except for a shorter FL and greater AC around 36-40 weeks' gestation. In MR analyses, each genetically determined 1-cigarette-per-day increase was associated with a smaller EFW from 20 weeks' gestation to birth in smokers (p = 0.01, difference in mean EFW at 40 weeks = -45 g [95% CI -81 to -10]) and a greater EFW from 32 weeks' gestation onwards in non-smokers (p = 0.03, difference in mean EFW at 40 weeks = 26 g [95% CI 5 to 47]). There was no evidence that partner smoking was associated with fetal growth. Study limitations include measurement error due to maternal self-report of smoking and the modest sample size for MR analyses resulting in unconfounded estimates being less precise. The apparent positive association of the genetic instrument with fetal growth in non-smokers suggests that genetic pleiotropy may have masked a stronger association in smokers. Conclusions A consistent linear dose-dependent association of maternal smoking with fetal growth was observed from the early second trimester onwards, while no major growth deficit was found in women who quit smoking early in pregnancy except for a shorter FL during late gestation. These findings reinforce the importance of smoking cessation advice in preconception and antenatal care and show that smoking reduction can lower the risk of impaired fetal growth in women who struggle to quit.
   Author summaryWhy was this study done? Maternal smoking during pregnancy is an established risk factor for low infant birth weight. Understanding when and which parameters of fetal growth are affected by different smoking behaviours is important for strengthening and focusing clinical and public health guidelines. The importance of smoking cessation in early pregnancy and the extent to which fetal growth restriction can be prevented or minimised by lowering cigarette consumption in women who find quitting difficult is also uncertain. What did the researchers do and find? We analysed data from 8,621 white European liveborn singletons from 2 population-based pregnancy cohorts to assess the associations of maternal quitting, reducing, and continuing smoking during pregnancy with the longitudinal growth of different fetal parameters (weight, head circumference, femur length, and abdominal circumference). We compared results across 3 different analytical approaches (conventional multivariable, Mendelian randomization, and parental negative control analyses) to strengthen confidence in our findings. We found that pre-pregnancy smokers who continued smoking during pregnancy had a reduced fetal size from early gestation (12-16 weeks) onwards. Associations of maternal smoking with each fetal parameter followed a dose-dependent pattern, with fetal size reductions increasing in magnitude with the number of cigarettes smoked. While all fetal parameters were affected in women who continued smoking during pregnancy, size reductions were most pronounced for femur length. In pre-pregnancy smokers who gave up smoking early in pregnancy, no overall growth deficit was observed, except for a smaller femur length towards the end of pregnancy. The association of maternal smoking with reduced fetal growth was consistent across all 3 methods, thus providing stronger support that the association is causal, in comparison to current evidence, which relies solely on multivariable regression. What do these findings mean? Our findings reinforce existing advice promoting and supporting smoking cessation in preconception and antenatal care services; they provide strong support for these recommendations. The consistent results across methods for a linear dose-dependent association of maternal smoking with reduced fetal growth from early gestation in women who continue smoking during pregnancy provide evidence to support reducing smoking amounts in those who struggle to quit.

AB Background The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted by all United Nations (UN) member states in 2015, established a set of bold and ambitious health-related targets to achieve by 2030. Understanding China's progress toward these targets is critical to improving population health for its 1.4 billion people. Methods and findings We used estimates from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2016, national surveys and surveillance data from China, and qualitative data. Twenty-eight of the 37 indicators included in the GBD Study 2016 were analyzed. We developed an attainment index of health-related SDGs, a scale of 0-100 based on the values of indicators. The projection model is adjusted based on the one developed by the GBD Study 2016 SDG collaborators. We found that China has achieved several health-related SDG targets, including decreasing neonatal and under-5 mortality rates and the maternal mortality ratios and reducing wasting and stunting for children. However, China may only achieve 12 out of the 28 health-related SDG targets by 2030. The number of target indicators achieved varies among provinces and municipalities. In 2016, among the seven measured health domains, China performed best in child nutrition and maternal and child health and reproductive health, with the attainment index scores of 93.0 and 91.8, respectively, followed by noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) (69.4), road injuries (63.6), infectious diseases (63.0), environmental health (62.9), and universal health coverage (UHC) (54.4). There are daunting challenges to achieve the targets for child overweight, infectious diseases, NCD risk factors, and environmental exposure factors. China will also have a formidable challenge in achieving UHC, particularly in ensuring access to essential healthcare for all and providing adequate financial protection. The attainment index of child nutrition is projected to drop to 80.5 by 2025 because of worsening child overweight. The index of NCD risk factors is projected to drop to 38.8 by 2025. Regional disparities are substantial, with eastern provinces generally performing better than central and western provinces. Sex disparities are clear, with men at higher risk of excess mortality than women. The primary limitations of this study are the limited data availability and quality for several indicators and the adoption of "business-as-usual" projection methods. Conclusion The study found that China has made good progress in improving population health, but challenges lie ahead. China has substantially improved the health of children and women and will continue to make good progress, although geographic disparities remain a great challenge. Meanwhile, China faced challenges in NCDs, mental health, and some infectious diseases. Poor control of health risk factors and worsening environmental threats have posed difficulties in further health improvement. Meanwhile, an inefficient health system is a barrier to tackling these challenges among such a rapidly aging population. The eastern provinces are predicted to perform better than the central and western provinces, and women are predicted to be more likely than men to achieve these targets by 2030. In order to make good progress, China must take a series of concerted actions, including more investments in public goods and services for health and redressing the intracountry inequities.
   Author summaryWhy was the study done? China has made impressive progress in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) era, which ended in 2015. Despite China's success in achieving the MDGs, it faces formidable challenges in achieving many targets in the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which have a 2030 target date. Understanding China's current situation and progress toward achieving these goals is critical to the development of practical solutions for improving population health for its 1.4 billion people in the SDG era. What did the researchers do and find? We conducted an analysis of progress toward the health-related SDGs using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2016, national surveys, surveillance data from China, and qualitative study results. We developed an index of the attainment of the health-related SDGs, using a scale of 0-100 based on the absolute values of indicators. We adjusted the projection model developed by the GBD 2016 SDG collaborators to produce sex-specific estimates, stratified by province, and explore sex and regional disparities. Around 120 key informants were purposively approached for thematic interviews. This research found that China has achieved several health-related SDG targets, especially on child nutrition and maternal and child health and reproductive health. Nevertheless, China may only achieve 12 out of the 28 selected health-related SDG targets by 2030. There are daunting challenges ahead for China in achieving the targets for child overweight, infectious diseases, noncommunicable disease risk factors, environmental exposure factors, and universal health coverage. Regional disparities were substantial, with eastern coastal provinces generally performing better than central and western provinces in most of the indicators. Sex disparities were clear, with men at higher risk of excess mortality than women. What do these findings mean? To achieve the targets of the health-related SDGs, China must take a series of concerted actions, including increased investment in public goods and services for health, addressing the regional inequities, and tackling the emerging new health challenges to ensure that no one is left behind. In those areas where China has already achieved the SDG targets, the government should synthesize the experiences and good practices that can be applied to the regions/provinces that need to catch up to the level of health development witnessed in developed regions/provinces. The Chinese government needs to examine the root causes of the challenges in achieving the health-related SDGs and develop an action plan to address these causes. The plan should prioritize key policy interventions for target populations and mobilize adequate resources to tackle these health challenges. It is important to address common problems by tackling cross-cutting issues in advancing the health-related SDGs, such as strengthening the enforcement of laws and regulations, establishing effective organizational structures, and human resources development.

TI Long-term mortality in mothers of infants with neonatal abstinence
   syndrome: A population-based parallel-cohort study in England and

AB Author summaryWhy was this study done? Opioids are now a leading cause of death of young and middle-aged people in North America, and rates of use and misuse are also increasing in the United Kingdom. There has been a steep increase in the number of women who use opioids in pregnancy, which often results in their infants having signs of withdrawal, called neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Most studies of NAS focus on the child's health, with very few about the mother's health. Pregnancy is an opportunity to identify mothers who may need addiction services and other support to improve their health and that of their families. We wanted to measure how much more commonly women whose infants had NAS die from all causes in the years following birth compared with other mothers in both Canada and England. What did the researchers do and find? We used population-based data that included all hospital births in England and Ontario, Canada, from 2002 to 2012 and analyzed death rates through to 2016. We studied 13,577 mothers in England and 4,966 in Ontario with infants with NAS and 4,205,675 mothers in England and 929,985 in Ontario whose infants did not have NAS. Mothers with infants with NAS were more likely than mothers of infants without NAS to live in poverty, have other mental health and addiction problems, and have their infants placed in out-of-home care. At 10 years after giving birth, 5.1% of English mothers with infants with NAS and 4.6% of Ontarian ones had died, compared with 0.4% of mothers whose infants did not have NAS in both countries. This translates to an 11-12 times higher risk of death associated with prenatal opioid use. The majority of deaths in mothers with infants with NAS were from avoidable causes such as intentional and unintentional injuries. We did not observe any particular time after birth that was associated with a high risk of death. What do these findings mean? Women whose infants have NAS are at much higher risk of dying in the years following birth than mothers whose infants did not have NAS. Clinicians should ensure that mothers of infants with NAS receive available services to support their health. Researchers need to test which models of care can best be used to improve the health of these mothers and reduce the risks they face that may cause them to die early. Policymakers focused on harm reduction related to opioid use should include a focus on pregnant mothers and their children; programs will need to extend past the current typical period of only 1-2 years after birth.
   Background Opioid addiction is a major public health threat to healthy life expectancy; however, little is known of long-term mortality for mothers with opioid use in pregnancy. Pregnancy and delivery care are opportunities to improve access to addiction and supportive services. Treating neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) as a marker of opioid use during pregnancy, this study reports long-term maternal mortality among mothers with a birth affected by NAS in relation to that of mothers without a NAS-affected birth in 2 high-prevalence jurisdictions, England and Ontario, Canada. Methods and findings We conducted a population-based study using linked administrative health data to develop parallel cohorts of mother-infant dyads in England and Ontario between 2002 and 2012. The study population comprised 13,577 and 4,966 mothers of infants with NAS and 4,205,675 and 929,985 control mothers in England and Ontario, respectively. Death records captured all-cause maternal mortality after delivery through March 31, 2016, and cause-specific maternal mortality to December 31, 2014. The primary exposure was a live birth of an infant with NAS, and the main outcome was all deaths among mothers following their date of delivery. We modelled the association between NAS and all-cause maternal mortality using Cox regression, and the cumulative incidence of cause-specific mortality within a competing risks framework. All-cause mortality rates, 10-year cumulative incidence risk of death, and crude and age-adjusted hazard ratios were calculated. Estimated crude 10-year mortality based on Kaplan-Meier curves in mothers of infants with NAS was 5.1% (95% CI 4.7%-5.6%) in England and 4.6% (95% CI 3.8%-5.5%) in Ontario versus 0.4% (95% CI 0.41%-0.42%) in England and 0.4% (95% CI 0.38%-0.41%) in Ontario for controls (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Survival curves showed no clear inflection point or period of heightened risk. The crude hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 12.1 (95% 11.1-13.2; p < 0.001) in England and 11.4 (9.7-13.4; p < 0.001) in Ontario; age adjustment did not reduce the hazard ratios. The cumulative incidence of death was higher among NAS mothers than controls for almost all causes of death. The majority of deaths were by avoidable causes, defined as those that are preventable, amenable to care, or both. Limitations included lack of direct measures of maternal opioid use, other substance misuse, and treatments or supports received. Conclusions In this study, we found that approximately 1 in 20 mothers of infants with NAS died within 10 years of delivery in both England and Canada-a mortality risk 11-12 times higher than for control mothers. Risk of death was not limited to the early postpartum period targeted by most public health programs. Policy responses to the current opioid epidemic require effective strategies for long-term support to improve the health and welfare of opioid-using mothers and their children.

AB Author summaryWhy was this study done? Previous studies have indicated that supervised injection facilities contribute to reductions in overdose-related deaths. However, it is not known if supervised injection facility use may shape risk of all-cause mortality. From a public health perspective, this is an important topic to investigate given the urgent need for evidence-based interventions to address the disproportionately high rates of premature mortality experienced by people who inject drugs in many settings internationally. What did the researchers do and find? In this study, we prospectively followed a community-recruited cohort of 811 people who inject drugs in Vancouver, Canada, for a median follow-up duration of 6 years. We longitudinally assessed the association between frequent supervised injection facility use and all-cause mortality using extended Cox regression with time-updated covariates. We found that this cohort of people who inject drugs experienced a high burden of premature mortality. A total of 112 participants (13.8%) died during follow-up, yielding a crude mortality rate of 22.7 (95% confidence interval 18.7-27.4) deaths per 1,000 person-years and a median of 34 years of potential life lost (interquartile range 27-42) per death. We also found that individuals who reported using supervised injection facilities on an at least weekly basis had a reduced risk of dying compared to those who reported less than weekly or no use of this health service. This association held after statistical adjustment for potential confounders including age, sex, HIV seropositivity, unstable housing, at least daily cocaine injection, public injection, incarceration, enrolment in addiction treatment, and calendar year of interview (adjusted hazard ratio 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.26-0.80, = 0.006). What do these findings mean? These findings suggest that increasing access to supervised injection facilities may help to prevent premature mortality among people who inject drugs. Additional studies should be conducted to determine individual-level estimates of the impact of supervised injection facility use on specific causes of death, and to discern possible underlying mechanisms that may account for these potential associations.
   Background People who inject drugs (PWID) experience elevated rates of premature mortality. Although previous studies have demonstrated the role of supervised injection facilities (SIFs) in reducing various harms associated with injection drug use, including accidental overdose death, the possible impact of SIF use on all-cause mortality is unknown. Therefore, we examined the relationship between frequent SIF use and all-cause mortality among PWID in Vancouver, Canada. Methods and findings Data were derived from 2 prospective cohort studies of PWID in Vancouver, Canada, between December 2006 and June 2017. Every 6 months, participants completed questionnaires that elicited information regarding sociodemographic characteristics, substance use patterns, social-structural exposures, and use of health services including SIFs. These data were confidentially linked to the provincial vital statistics database to ascertain mortality rates and causes of death. We used multivariable extended Cox regression analyses to estimate the independent association between frequent (i.e., at least weekly) SIF use and all-cause mortality. Of 811 participants, 278 (34.3%) were women, and the median age was 39 years (IQR 33-46) at baseline. In total, 432 (53.3%) participants reported frequent SIF use at baseline, and 379 (46.7%) did not. At baseline, frequent SIF users were on average younger than nonfrequent users, and a higher proportion of frequent SIF users than nonfrequent users were unstably housed, resided in the Downtown Eastside neighbourhood, injected in public, had a recent non-fatal overdose, used prescription opioids at least daily, injected heroin at least daily, injected cocaine at least daily, and injected crystal methamphetamine at least daily. A lower proportion of frequent SIF users than nonfrequent users were HIV positive and enrolled in addiction treatment at baseline. The median duration of follow-up among study participants was 72 months (IQR 24-123). In total, 112 participants (13.8%) died during the study period, yielding a crude mortality rate of 22.7 (95% CI 18.7-27.4) deaths per 1,000 person-years. The median years of potential life lost per death was 34 (IQR 27-42) years. In a time-updated multivariable model, frequent SIF use was inversely associated with risk of all-cause mortality after adjusting for potential confounders, including age, sex, HIV seropositivity, unstable housing, at least daily cocaine injection, public injection, incarceration, enrolment in addiction treatment, and calendar year of interview (adjusted hazard ratio 0.46, 95% CI 0.26-0.80, p = 0.006). The main study limitations are the limited generalizability of findings due to non-random sampling, the potential for reporting biases due to reliance on some self-reported information, and the possibility that residual confounding influenced findings. Conclusions We observed a high burden of premature mortality among a community-recruited cohort of PWID. Frequent SIF use was associated with a lower risk of death, independent of relevant confounders. These findings support efforts to enhance access to SIFs as a strategy to reduce mortality among PWID. Further analyses of individual-level data are needed to determine estimates of, and potential causal pathways underlying, associations between SIF use and specific causes of death.

AB Background Opioid misuse and deaths are increasing in the United States. In 2017, Ohio had the second highest overdose rates in the US, with the city of Cincinnati experiencing a 50% rise in opioid overdoses since 2015. Understanding the temporal and geographic variation in overdose emergencies may help guide public policy responses to the opioid epidemic. Methods and findings We used a publicly available data set of suspected heroin-related emergency calls (n = 6,246) to map overdose incidents to 280 census block groups in Cincinnati between August 1, 2015, and January 30, 2019. We used a Bayesian space-time Poisson regression model to examine the relationship between demographic and environmental characteristics and the number of calls within block groups. Higher numbers of heroin-related incidents were found to be associated with features of the built environment, including the proportion of parks (relative risk [RR] = 2.233; 95% credible interval [CI]: [1.075-4.643]), commercial (RR = 13.200; 95% CI: [4.584-38.169]), manufacturing (RR = 4.775; 95% CI: [1.958-11.683]), and downtown development zones (RR = 11.362; 95% CI: [3.796-34.015]). The number of suspected heroin-related emergency calls was also positively associated with the proportion of male population, the population aged 35-49 years, and distance to pharmacies and was negatively associated with the proportion aged 18-24 years, the proportion of the population with a bachelor's degree or higher, median household income, the number of fast food restaurants, distance to hospitals, and distance to opioid treatment programs. Significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the risks of incidents remained after adjusting for covariates. Limitations of this study include lack of information about the nature of incidents after dispatch, which may differ from the initial classification of being related to heroin, and lack of information on local policy changes and interventions. Conclusions We identified areas with high numbers of reported heroin-related incidents and features of the built environment and demographic characteristics that are associated with these events in the city of Cincinnati. Publicly available information about opiate overdoses, combined with data on spatiotemporal risk factors, may help municipalities plan, implement, and target harm-reduction measures. In the US, more work is necessary to improve data availability in other cities and states and the compatibility of data from different sources in order to adequately measure and monitor the risk of overdose and inform health policies.
   Author summaryWhy was this study done? Opioid-related overdose has become one of the most common causes of death in the United States. Information about the spatiotemporal pattern of overdose emergencies may be useful in guiding policy responses to the opioid crisis. What did the researchers do and find? We used publicly available data on emergency medical calls to map incidents of suspected heroin-related incidents to census block groups in Cincinnati between August 1, 2015, and January 30, 2019. We developed a spatiotemporal statistical model that assessed the association between the number of suspected overdose incidents and demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental characteristics in census block groups. We identified features of the built environment and demographic characteristics associated with a higher numbers of heroin-related calls in areas of the city of Cincinnati. What do these findings mean? Understanding the spatiotemporal risk of suspected heroin-related overdose and block group characteristics could inform the design and targeting of public health interventions in the future. Greater access to real-time emergency medical services data would help researchers and policymakers better understand the risk of suspected heroin-related overdose.

TI The overweight and obesity transition from the wealthy to the poor in
   low- and middle-income countries: A survey of household data from 103
   countries
SO PLOS MEDICINE
LA English

ID ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; PREVENTION; PREVALENCE; BURDEN
AB Background In high-income countries, obesity prevalence (body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m(2)) is highest among the poor, while overweight (body mass index greater than or equal to 25 kg/m(2)) is prevalent across all wealth groups. In contrast, in low-income countries, the prevalence of overweight and obesity is higher among wealthier individuals than among poorer individuals. We characterize the transition of overweight and obesity from wealthier to poorer populations as countries develop, and project the burden of overweight and obesity among the poor for 103 countries. Methods and findings Our sample used 182 Demographic and Health Surveys and World Health Surveys (n = 2.24 million respondents) from 1995 to 2016. We created a standard wealth index using household assets common among all surveys and linked national wealth by country and year identifiers. We then estimated the changing probability of overweight and obesity across every wealth decile as countries' per capita gross domestic product (GDP) rises using logistic and linear fixed-effect regression models. We found that obesity rates among the wealthiest decile were relatively stable with increasing national wealth, and the changing gradient was largely due to increasing obesity prevalence among poorer populations (3.5% [95% uncertainty interval: 0.0%-8.3%] to 14.3% [9.7%-19.0%]). Overweight prevalence among the richest (45.0% [35.6%-54.4%]) and the poorest (45.5% [35.9%-55.0%]) were roughly equal in high-income settings. At $8,000 GDP per capita, the adjusted probability of being obese was no longer highest in the richest decile, and the same was true of overweight at $10,000. Above $25,000, individuals in the richest decile were less likely than those in the poorest decile to be obese, and the same was true of overweight at $50,000. We then projected overweight and obesity rates by wealth decile to 2040 for all countries to quantify the expected rise in prevalence in the relatively poor. Our projections indicated that, if past trends continued, the number of people who are poor and overweight will increase in our study countries by a median 84.4% (range 3.54%-383.4%), most prominently in low-income countries. The main limitations of this study included the inclusion of cross-sectional, self-reported data, possible reverse causality of overweight and obesity on wealth, and the lack of physical activity and food price data. Conclusions Our findings indicate that as countries develop economically, overweight prevalence increased substantially among the poorest and stayed mostly unchanged among the wealthiest. The relative poor in upper- and lower-middle income countries may have the greatest burden, indicating important planning and targeting needs for national health programs.
   Author summaryWhy was this study done? Obesity prevalence has been rising in every country in the world since 1975 and contributes to an increasing proportion of noncommunicable disease risk and burden. Within countries, obesity prevalence is highest among wealthier population strata in poorer countries, but the burden of obesity shifts to poorer population strata as national wealth increases. While the flipped wealth gradients of obesity in poor and rich countries are documented, no research shows how this shift happens or where it occurs along the range of economic development. This work was motivated by a desire to inform policy makers of when and how this reversal is likely to occur, because obesity among the poor has different implications for public health policy than obesity among the wealthy. What did the researchers do and find? We collated 182 Demographic and Health Surveys and World Health Surveys [ = 2.24 million respondents] from 103 countries with information on respondent height, weight, personal wealth, and country wealth. We estimated the relationship of personal wealth with overweight and obesity, and examined how that relationship varies with country wealth. At a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of $8,000, the prevalence of obesity is no longer the highest among those in the top wealth decile ($10,000 for overweight), and at $30,000, obesity prevalence among those in the poorest decile is higher than among the wealthiest ($50,000 for overweight). The transition is driven by increasing obesity among the poor without appreciable decreasing obesity among the wealthy. Above $10,000 GDP per capita, the relationship between overweight and personal wealth starts to change as overweight prevalence among those in the lower deciles of wealth increases. We estimate that 70.2% (64.1%-76.4%) of countries will begin or have undergone this shift by 2040, and the number of people who are both obese and poor (in the lowest quintile) in our study countries will increase by 17.3 million people (15.3-19.6). What do these findings mean? Distinct points along the obesity transition may represent a particularly effective time for policy makers to implement obesity interventions. At a GDP per capita of $8,000, the burden of paying for the costs of obesity may start to increase, as the prevalence of obesity is no longer uniquely concentrated among the wealthy. People in the richest decile may not be affected by the same economic mechanisms that increase obesity in the poor, as obesity prevalence of the wealthy within each country does not change substantially with economic development.

TI Accuracy of real-time multi-model ensemble forecasts for seasonal
   influenza in the US
SO PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID TRANSMISSION
AB Author summary Seasonal influenza outbreaks cause millions of infections and tens of thousands of deaths in the United States each year. Forecasting the track of an influenza season can help public health officials, business leaders, and the general public decide how to respond to an ongoing or emerging outbreak. Our team assembled over 20 unique forecasting models for seasonal influenza and combined them together into a single "ensemble" model. We made predictions of the 2017/2018 influenza season, each week sending real-time forecasts to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In the 2017/2018 influenza season, one of the largest seasonal outbreaks in the last 15 years, our ensemble model performed better on average than all individual forecast models in the ensemble. Based on results from this study, the CDC used forecasts from our ensemble model in public communication and internal reports in the subsequent 2018/2019 influenza season.
   Seasonal influenza results in substantial annual morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide. Accurate forecasts of key features of influenza epidemics, such as the timing and severity of the peak incidence in a given season, can inform public health response to outbreaks. As part of ongoing efforts to incorporate data and advanced analytical methods into public health decision-making, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has organized seasonal influenza forecasting challenges since the 2013/2014 season. In the 2017/2018 season, 22 teams participated. A subset of four teams created a research consortium called the FluSight Network in early 2017. During the 2017/2018 season they worked together to produce a collaborative multi-model ensemble that combined 21 separate component models into a single model using a machine learning technique called stacking. This approach creates a weighted average of predictive densities where the weight for each component is determined by maximizing overall ensemble accuracy over past seasons. In the 2017/2018 influenza season, one of the largest seasonal outbreaks in the last 15 years, this multi-model ensemble performed better on average than all individual component models and placed second overall in the CDC challenge. It also outperformed the baseline multi-model ensemble created by the CDC that took a simple average of all models submitted to the forecasting challenge. This project shows that collaborative efforts between research teams to develop ensemble forecasting approaches can bring measurable improvements in forecast accuracy and important reductions in the variability of performance from year to year. Efforts such as this, that emphasize real-time testing and evaluation of forecasting models and facilitate the close collaboration between public health officials and modeling researchers, are essential to improving our understanding of how best to use forecasts to improve public health response to seasonal and emerging epidemic threats.

AB Background Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease with significant potential morbidity and mortality. Substantial gaps have been documented between the development and dissemination of clinical practice guidelines (CPG) and their implementation in practice. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a multi-component knowledge transfer intervention to implement a CPG for the management of SLE (CPG-SLE). Methods The study is an open, multicentre, controlled trial with random allocation by clusters to intervention or control. Clusters are four public university hospitals of the Canary Islands Health Service where rheumatologists are invited to participate. Patients diagnosed with SLE at least one year prior to recruitment are selected. Rheumatologists in intervention group receive a short educational group programme to both update their knowledge about SLE management according to CPG-SLE recommendations and to acquire knowledge and training on use of the patient-centred approach, a decision support tool embedded in the electronic clinical record and a quarterly feedback report containing information on management of SLE patients. Primary endpoint is change in self-perceived disease activity. Secondary endpoints are adherence of professionals to CPG-SLE recommendations, health-related quality of life, patient perception of their participation in decision making, attitudes of professionals towards shared decision making, knowledge of professionals about SLE and use of healthcare resources. Calculated sample size is 412 patients. Data will be collected from questionnaires and clinical records. Length of follow-up will be 18 months. Multilevel mixed models with repeated time measurements will be used to analyze changes in outcomes over time. Cost-effectiveness, from both social and healthcare services perspectives, will be analyzed by measuring effectiveness in terms of quality-adjusted life years gained. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses are planned. Discussion Impact of CPGs in clinical practice could be improved by applying proven value interventions to implement them. The results of this ongoing trial are expected to generate important scientifically valid and reproducible information not only on clinical effectiveness but also on cost-effectiveness of a multi-component intervention for implementation of a CPG based on communication technologies for chronic patients in the hospital setting.

AB Background Depression is a debilitating mental health condition which affects an estimated 350 million people worldwide annually. Nurses are twice as likely to suffer from depression than professionals in other professions. This leads to a considerable loss of efficiency and productivity. We sought to determine the prevalence and predictors of depression among nurses in Cameroon. Methods Cross-sectional analysis carried out over 6 months (January - June 2018) using nurses from public and private healthcare institutions sampled consecutively in the two English-speaking regions (North west and South west regions) of Cameroon. The nurses were handed a structured, printed, self-administered questionnaire to fill and hand in at their earliest convenience. Depression and burnout were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 and the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory respectively. Results A total of 143 nurses were recruited (mean age: 29.75 +/- 6.55 years; age range: 20-55 years, 32.87% male). The overall prevalence of depression was 62.24%. Independent predictors of depression after multivariable analysis were: Number of night shifts a week (adjusted odds ratio: 1.58; p value: 0.045, 95% CI; 1.01, 2.48) and Total Oldenburg Burnout Inventory score (adjusted odds ratio: 1.21, p value: 0.001; 95% CI; 1.08, 1.35). Recreational drug use was also found to perfectly predict the outcome - depression. Conclusion Depression is highly prevalent among nurses in the English-speaking regions of Cameroon. Accurate predictors could prove vital for early detection and management of affected individuals. Predictors presented herein require further investigation via multicentric nationwide studies, to obtain more generalizable results.

AB Background Maintaining quality of vaccines is one of the main challenges of immunization programs in Ethiopia. The objective of this study is to assess the factor affecting vaccine cold chain management practice in immunization health institutions in East Gojam zone of Amhara region, Ethiopia. Method An institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted from March to April 2017 in ten districts of East Gojam zone of Amhara Region. Descriptive statistics and Logistic regression analysis were carried out to identify factors related to the practice of cold chain management. Result Among 60 health institutions, only 46(76.7%) had functional refrigerators. Twenty-one (35%) had a functional generator for backup service and 28(46.6%) had a car/motorbike for transportation of vaccines in case of refrigerator/power failure. Twenty-nine (48.3%) had known the correct vaccine storage temperature (2 degrees C - 8 degrees C) in the refrigerator and the results of this study revealed that only 23(38.3%) of respondents had sufficient knowledge about vaccine cold chain management. The finding of this study also revealed that 35(58.3%) had appropriate vaccine cold chain management practice and the rest 25(41.7%) had inappropriate practice. Logistic regression showed us the knowledge gap and profession were significantly associated with vaccine cold chain management practice at P < 0.05. Conclusion This study indicates that there was a knowledge gap of health workers who are working on cold chain management. There is an urgent need to improve knowledge and practice on cold chain management through improved supervision and training at a different level of health care system.

AB Background San Francisco has implemented several programs addressing the needs of two large vulnerable populations: people living with HIV and those who are homeless. Assessment of these programs on health outcomes is paramount for reducing preventable deaths. Methods Individuals diagnosed with HIV/AIDS and reported to the San Francisco Department of Public Health HIV surveillance registry, ages 13 years or older, who resided in San Francisco at the time of diagnosis, and who died between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2016 were included in this longitudinal study. The primary independent variable was housing status, dichotomized as ever homeless since diagnosed with HIV, and the dependent variables were disease-specific causes of death, as noted on the death certificate. The Cochran-Armitage test measured changes in the mortality rates over time and unadjusted and adjusted Poisson regression models measured prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for causes of death. Results A total of 4158 deceased individuals were included in the analyses: the majority were male (87%), ages 40-59 years old at the time of death (64%), non-Hispanic White (60%), men who have sex with men (54%), had an AIDS diagnosis prior to death (87%), and San Francisco residents at the time of death (63%). Compared to those who were housed, those who were homeless were more likely to be younger at time of death, African American, have a history of injecting drugs, female or transgender, and were living below the poverty level (all p values < 0.0001). Among decedents who were SF residents at the time of death, there were declines in the proportion of deaths due to AIDS-defining conditions (p < 0.05) and increases in accidents, cardiomyopathy, heart disease, ischemic disease, non-AIDS cancers, and drug overdoses (p < 0.05). After adjustment, deaths due to mental disorders (aPR = 1.63, 95% CI 1.24, 2.14) were more likely and deaths due to non-AIDS cancers (aPR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.44, 0.89) were less likely among those experiencing homelessness. Conclusions Additional efforts are needed to improve mental health services to homeless people with HIV and prevent mental-health related mortality.

   interests
ID FOOD; ADDRESS; TOBACCO; CHILD
AB Background Although public-private partnerships have become common in the health sector, the evidence supporting their effectiveness is limited, and when the products or services provided by the private partner are harmful to health inherent conflicts of interest may be difficult to overcome. The objective of this study is to appraise the evidence describing process or effectiveness of public-private partnerships (PPPs) that aim to promote population health, and analyse how characteristics such as independence or competing interests influence the results of their evaluation. Methods We carried out a systematic search of Medline and Web of Science to identify scientific reports evaluating the process or effectiveness of PPPs that aim to promote population health. Two reviewers applied inclusion criteria, extracted and evaluated study quality. We classified PPPs according to the health problem tackled, the independence of the evaluation, and the potential for competition between business interests of the private partner and health promotion activity undertaken. We classified the conclusions of the evaluation as positive (supportive/tentatively supportive) or negative (semi-critical/critical). Results We identified 36 studies evaluating 25 PPPs. Evaluations that were favourable to the use of PPPs in health promotion were more frequently classed as "not independent" and of poor quality. On the other hand, negative evaluations were more common when the PPP involved a private partner with a high potential for competition between the health promotion activity undertaken and their financial interests. PPPs that sought to prevent non-communicable diseases were more frequently negatively evaluated compared to PPPs tackling infectious disease or other types of health problem. Almost all of the evaluations evaluated process, with only 2 papers reporting quantitative health related outcomes. Conclusions There is still a lack of sound evidence supporting the effectiveness of public-private partnerships in health promotion, and the evidence base is skewed by non-independent evaluations. Public health actors should abstain from engaging in agreements with industries whose business interests have a high potential for competition with the health promotion activity undertaken.

AB Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) are defined as a collaborative approach in which the public and private sector share resources, responsibilities and risks to achieve common objectives and mutual benefits in a sustainable manner. PPPs are identified as a key solution to reinforce Veterinary Services. However only limited information is available on the scope, added value and enabling factors of PPPs in this sector. The aims of this study were to develop a typology of PPPs in the veterinary field and to identify key success factors and obstacles to their implementation. A structured questionnaire was sent to all 181 World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Member Countries and to 47 private contacts. 36 different variables characterizing PPP initiatives were collected. 97 examples of PPPs were retrieved from 76 countries. Dimensionality reduction techniques were combined with clustering and discrimination methods to establish a typology of PPPs and to derive a set of simple rules to classify new instances of PPPs. Three clusters were identified, separated according to two main variables: the type of private partners and the type of interaction. Cluster 1, transactional PPPs, represented the traditional understanding of PPPs by Veterinary Services, initiated and funded by the public sector, giving service delivery accreditation to mostly private veterinarians; cluster 2, collaborative PPPs, included partnerships between producer associations and public Veterinary Services, driven by trade interests; cluster 3, transformational PPPs, represented joint programs initiated and funded by private companies and initially driven by business development objectives. Specific success factors and key obstacles affecting the performances and sustainability of these initiatives were identified for each cluster. This study represents the first practical attempt to develop a meaningful typology of PPPs in the field of animal health and to identify fundamental obstacles currently inhibiting the development of PPPs, and suggests ways to support national Veterinary Services in overcoming these obstacles.

   aegypti L. (Diptera: Culicidae)
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID INSECTICIDE RESISTANCE; MOSQUITOS; PESTICIDES; TOXICITY; EFFICACY; PLANT
AB The family of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) contains several species of major public health relevance due to their role as vectors of human disease. One of these species, Aedes aegypti, is responsible for the transmission of some of the most important vector-borne viruses affecting humankind, including dengue fever, chikungunya and Zika. Traditionally, control of Ae. aegypti and other arthropod species has relied on the use of a relatively small diversity of chemical insecticides. However, widespread and intensive use of these substances has caused significant adverse environmental effects and has contributed to the appearance of pesticide-resistant populations in an increasing number of locations around the world, thereby dramatically reducing their efficiency. Therefore, it becomes urgent to develop novel alternative tools for vector control. In that context, our study aimed at evaluating the insecticidal activity against Ae. aegypti of aqueous extracts obtained from the fruits of Solanum mammosum L., as well as silver nanoparticles synthesized using aqueous extracts from this plant species (SmAgNPs). To perform the test, third instar Ae. aegypti larvae were exposed to increasing concentrations of plant extract and SmAgNPs for 24 h. Our results suggest that both the aqueous extract and SmAgNPs were toxic to the larvae, with SmAgNPs displaying a much higher level of toxicity than the extract alone, as reflected in their LC50 values (0.06 ppm vs 1631.27 ppm, respectively). These results suggest that both S. mammosum extracts and SmAgNPs exhibit noteworthy larvicidal activity, and should be further explored as potential source of alternative tools in the fight against insect vectors of human disease.

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID DAILY OCCUPATIONS; PARTICIPATION; PEOPLE; SAFETY; HEALTH
AB Background
   The aim of the study was to describe the experience of outdoor mobility among immigrants with late effects of polio living in Sweden. There is a need to understand more about this young group of persons since they often have problems with mobility and gait, but they may also face participation restrictions due to issues associated with integration into a new community and culture.
   Method
   A total of 14 young immigrants with late effects of polio participated and were interviewed individually. The study used a qualitative method to explore personal experiences and the interviews were analyzed through an inductive approach, using qualitative content analysis.
   Results
   The analysis led to a major theme; self-image and acceptance, that comprised a changeable process and experiences of cultural, social, and gender-specific barriers, but also of environmental and personal factors that impacted their outdoor mobility. By using a car, the participants felt they could come across as normal which also increased their self-esteem.
   Conclusions
   Independent mobility is a major enabler for ongoing employment and being able to use a car increases the chances for integration into society for young immigrants with late effects of polio. Public transport is not considered to be adequate or efficient enough due to the participants' mobility impairments, but driving can prevent involuntary isolation and facilitate participation. A car can increase quality of life but may also be a facilitator for work and reduce the demand for societal support.

TI Determinants of anemia among pregnant women attending antenatal care in
   Horo Guduru Wollega Zone, West Ethiopia: Unmatched case-control study
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PREVALENCE
AB Background
   Anemia is a common clinical problem contributing to increased maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality during pregnancy. Anemia can be caused by different factors apart from known diseases. The main aim of this study was to identify determinants of anemia among pregnant women attending antenatal care at the public health facilities of Horo Guduru Wollega Zone, West Ethiopia, 2017.
   Methods
   Health facility-based unmatched case-control study was conducted among 191 anemic and 382 non-anemic pregnant women from September 7, 2017, to October 25, 2017, in Horo Guduru Wollega Zone, West Ethiopia. Data were collected using pre-tested questionnaires from nine health facilities. Hemoglobin level determination, hemo-parasite diagnosis, venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test, and stool examination were done in the laboratories of the respective health centers. Cleaned and coded data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Frequency, proportion, mean and standard deviation were computed to summarize the data and presented by tables and bar graphs. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association of predictors and response variables at P. 0.05. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI was used to show the strength of association between predictors and outcome variables.
   Results
   A total of 573 pregnant women were enrolled in this study. Monthly income < 500 Ethiopian birr (AOR = 9.16, 95% CI: 4.23, 19.82), heavy menstrual bleeding (AOR = 2.38, 95%CI: 1.38, 4.09), taking iron supplement irregularly (AOR = 2.87, 95%CI:1.41, 5.84), Mid-upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) < 23 cm (AOR = 3.42, 95%CI: 2.07, 5.63), low dietary diversity score (AOR = 12.30, 95%CI: 4.64, 32.72), medium dietary diversity score (AOR = 3.40, 95%CI:1.48, 7.84) and intestinal helminthic infections (AOR = 6.31, 95%CI: 3.44, 11.58) were significantly associated with anemia during pregnancy.
   Conclusion
   Average monthly income < 500 Ethiopian birr, heavy menstrual bleeding, low and medium dietary diversity score, taking of iron supplements irregularly, MUAC < 23 cm and intestinal helminthic infections were identified as independent determinants of anemia during pregnancy. Therefore, improving dietary diversity intake, routine deworming and empowering women on taking iron regularly are vital to prevent anemia during pregnancy.

AB Background Periconceptional folic acid prevents neural tube defects (NTDs), but it is uncertain whether there are benefits for offspring neurodevelopment arising from continued maternal folic acid supplementation beyond the first trimester. We investigated the effect of folic acid supplementation during trimesters 2 and 3 of pregnancy on cognitive performance in the child. Methods We followed up the children of mothers who had participated in a randomized controlled trial in 2006/2007 of Folic Acid Supplementation during the Second and Third Trimesters (FASSTT) and received 400 mu g/d folic acid or placebo from the 14th gestational week until the end of pregnancy. Cognitive performance of children at 7 years was evaluated using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI-III) and at 3 years using the Bayley's Scale of Infant and Toddler Development (BSITD-III). Results From a total of 119 potential mother-child pairs, 70 children completed the assessment at age 7 years, and 39 at age 3 years. At 7 years, the children of folic acid treated mothers scored significantly higher than the placebo group in word reasoning: mean 13.3 (95% CI 12.4-14.2) versus 11.9 (95% CI 11.0-12.8); p = 0.027; at 3 years, they scored significantly higher in cognition: 10.3 (95% CI 9.3-11.3) versus 9.5 (95% CI 8.8-10.2); p = 0.040. At both time points, greater proportions of children from folic acid treated mothers compared with placebo had cognitive scores above the median values of 10 (girls and boys) for the BSITD-III, and 24.5 (girls) and 21.5 (boys) for the WPPSI-III tests. When compared with a nationally representative sample of British children at 7 years, WPPSI-III test scores were higher in children from folic acid treated mothers for verbal IQ (p < 0.001), performance IQ (p = 0.035), general language (p = 0.002), and full scale IQ (p = 0.001), whereas comparison of the placebo group with British children showed smaller differences in scores for verbal IQ (p = 0.034) and full scale IQ (p = 0.017) and no differences for performance IQ or general language. Conclusions Continued folic acid supplementation in pregnancy beyond the early period recommended to prevent NTD may have beneficial effects on child cognitive development. Further randomized trials in pregnancy with follow-up in childhood are warranted.

TI A PDGFR beta-PI3K signaling axis mediates periosteal cell activation
   during fracture healing

AB Insufficient and delayed fracture healing remain significant public health problems with limited therapeutic options. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, a major pathway involved in regulation of fracture healing, promotes proliferation, migration, and differentiation of osteoprogenitors. We have recently reported that knock-in mice with a global increase in PI3K signaling (gCbl(YF)) show enhanced femoral fracture healing characterized by an extraordinary periosteal response to injury. Interestingly, of all growth factor receptors involved in fracture healing, PI3K directly binds only to PDGFR. Given these findings, we hypothesized a PDGFR-PI3K interaction is necessary for mediating robust periosteal cell activation following fracture. In this study, we isolated primary periosteal cells from gCbl(YF) mice to analyze cross-talk between the PDGFR beta and PI3K signaling pathways. We found PDGFR beta signaling contributes to robust Akt phosphorylation in periosteal cells in comparison with other growth factor signaling pathways. Additionally, we performed femoral fractures on gCbI(YF) mice with a conditional removal of PDGFR beta in mesenchymal progenitors using inducible alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha SMA) CreER(T2) mice. Our studies showed that depletion of PDGFR beta signaling within these progenitors in the early phase of fracture healing significantly abrogates PI3K-mediated periosteal activation and proliferation three days after fracture. Combined, these results suggest that PDGFR beta signaling through PI3K is necessary for robust periosteal activation in the earliest phases of fracture healing.

TI Predictors of time to unfavorable treatment outcomes among patients with
   multidrug resistant tuberculosis in Oromia region, Ethiopia
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID TB; MORTALITY; MDR
AB Background
   Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a man-made problem when bacteria are resistant to at least two anti TB drugs (Rifampicin and Isoniazid). Currently from tuberculosis infected patients, two out of ten are developing MDR-TB and it is an emerging public health problem in Ethiopia. Despite high burden of MDR-TB in Ethiopia, the treatment outcomes and predictors related to incidence among MDR-TB patients is not studied in Oromia region, Ethiopia. Therefore, the present study assessed the predictors of time to unfavorable treatment outcomes among patients with multidrug resistant tuberculosis in Oromia region, Ethiopia
   Method
   Facility based retrospective cohort study was conducted at hospitals in Oromia Region. All registered MDR-TB patient charts from 2015 to 2017 were considered for the study. Data entry was done by using EPI data version 3.1 Statistical Software and data analysis was done by SPSS version 20. The descriptive statistics, frequency, median and range were employed. Bivariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to identify predictors of time to unfavorable treatment outcomes of multidrug resistant tuberculosis. In multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, the variables with P value less than and equal to 0.05 were considered as predictor variables for time to unfavorable treatment outcome of MDR-TB.
   Result
   From the total of 415 (92.84%) complete MDR-TB charts, the overall cumulative probability of unfavorable treatment outcome at the end of the treatment (two years) was 21.21%. In multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis initial culture result [AHR = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.29, 0.96], HIV test result [AHR = 3.76; 95% CI: 2.45, 5.78] and culture at the end of continuation phases [AHR = 0.12; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.20] were the predictors of unfavorable treatment outcome.
   Conclusion
   The magnitude of unfavorable treatment outcome at Oromia hospitals was lower than WHO regional report of 2018. This finding demonstrated that low unfavorable treatment outcomes for MDR-TB patients can be achieved in a resource-constrained and high TB-burden setting. Whereas, Initial culture result, HIV test result and culture at the end of continuation phases were determined as predictor factors with associated unfavorable treatment outcomes. Culture positive and HIV positive MDR-TB patients need special attention at the time of treatment.

AB Background: Leishmaniosis, zoonosis that produces significant public health impacts, is caused by Leishmania infantum. Canines are the main domestic reservoir and, besides humans, other species of mammals could be infected when living in endemic areas. In this study, we detected equine Leishmania infantum infections in a canine visceral leishmaniosis transmission area and evaluated the clinical, haematological, biochemical and oxidative stress disorders. This study was conducted in Uruguaiana, Rio Grande do Sul, south of Brazil. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 124 animals (98 horses and 26 dogs) of both genders and several breeds after they underwent general and dermatologic examinations.
   Results: Twenty five Leishmania infantum infected animals (20.16%), 14 horses and 11 dogs were detected by PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) amplification of kinetoplast DNA regions with 96% homology to Leishmania infantum (GenBank Accession No. L 19877.1). The clinical and haematological alterations of infected equines were skin lesions, nodules, lymphadenopathy, decreased levels in red blood cells and haematocrit (p < 0.05) and increase in urea serum concentration (p < 0.05), while CVL presented a decrease in red blood cells counts (p < 0.05), increase in lymphocytes (p < 0.05), and decrease in neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (p < 0.05). Oxidative stress markers of plasma protein carbonyl and plasma lipid peroxidation were not statistically significant (p > 0.05) in both species.
   Conclusions: To our knowledge, this has been the first leishmaniosis equine survey performed in south of Brazil, caused by Leishmania infantum that were able to initially identify haematological and biochemical changes in the species, even in asymptomatic animals. We present evidence supporting those findings of haematological and biochemical changes could be related to infection. Surprisingly, the clinical manifestations of equine infection were similar to those found in canine visceral leishmaniosis. The equine population could be play an important role in the cycle of leishmaniosis in south Brazil and consequently indicates a great risk of public health. This evaluation of infected animals is important to establish the clinical and laboratory parameters involved in the disease progression.

AB Background: Antimicrobial resistance is a global public health concern, with extensive associated health and economic implications. Actions to slow and contain the development of resistance are imperative. Despite the fact that overuse and misuse of antibiotics are highlighted as major contributing factors to this resistance, no sufficiently validated measures aiming to investigate the drivers behind consumer behaviour amongst the general population are available. The objective of this study was to develop and investigate the psychometric properties of an original, novel and multiple-item questionnaire, informed by the Theory of Planned Behaviour, to measure factors contributing to self-reported antibiotic use within the community.
   Method: A three-phase process was employed, including literature review and item generation; expert panel review; and pre-test. Investigation of the questionnaire was subsequently conducted through a cross-sectional, anonymous survey. Orthogonal principal analysis with varimax rotation, cronbach alpha and linear mixed-effects modelling analyses were conducted. A 60 item questionnaire was produced encompassing demographics, social desirability, three constructs of the Theory of Planned Behaviour including: attitudes and beliefs; subjective norm; perceived behavioural control; behaviour; and a covariate - knowledge.
   Results: Three hundred seventy-three participants completed the survey. Eighty participants (21%) were excluded due to social desirability concerns, with data from the remaining 293 participants analysed. Results showed modest but acceptable levels of internal reliability, with high inter-item correlations within each construct. All four variables and the outcome variable of antibiotic use behaviour comprised four items with the exception of social norms, for which there were two items, producing a final 18 item questionnaire. Perceived behavioural control, social norms, the interaction between attitudes and beliefs and knowledge, and the presence of a healthcare worker in the family were all significant predictors of antibiotic use behaviour. All other predictors tested produced a nonsignificant relationship with the outcome variable of self-reported antibiotic use.
   Conclusion: This study successfully developed and validated a novel tool which assesses factors influencing community antibiotic use and misuse. The questionnaire can be used to guide appropriate intervention strategies to reduce antibiotic misuse in the general population. Future research is required to assess the extent to which this tool can guide community-based intervention strategies.

AB Background: Early exit from paid employment is a notable public health and societal challenge. Previous research has largely focused on the relationships among variables instead of the relationships among individuals with different work participation history. Person-oriented methods enable to identify latent groups of individuals who are likely to follow similar development in their work participation over time. We thus aimed to identify work participation trajectories during early and midlife careers and their social determinants using large nationally representative data comprising over 1 million initially employed individuals and a 10-year follow-up for their work participation. A further aim was to determine the cumulative incidence of sickness absence due to key diagnostic groups, mental disorders and musculoskeletal diseases within the trajectories.
   Methods: Young (25-38 years at baseline, n = 495,663) and midlife (39-52 years at baseline, n = 603,085) Finnish people, all working in 2004, were followed up through 2013, with registers of the Social Insurance Institution, and the Statistics Finland. The registers provided data for work participation and its determinants, as well as for computing the cumulative incidence of sickness absence. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify trajectories.
   Results: Three distinctive trajectories were identified: temporary exit, permanent exit, and continuously employed people. As compared to the other trajectories, those belonging to the permanent exit trajectory were more likely men, manual workers and had a lower income. The cumulative incidence of sickness absence due to mental disorders was highest in the permanent exit trajectory group. For musculoskeletal diseases, the cumulative incidence of sickness absence increased in the permanent exit trajectory mainly in the older age groups.
   Conclusion: Distinct group-based trajectories of early work exit can be identified in a representative cohort of initially employed people. Focusing on the determinants of premature exit and early intervention to tackle increasing sickness absence may promote work participation particularly in the most vulnerable groups.

AB Background: In southern Papua, Indonesia, malaria is highly prevalent in young children and is a significant cause of morbidity and early mortality. The association between malaria and delayed mortality is unknown.
   Methods: Routinely-collected hospital surveillance data from southern Papua, Indonesia, were used to assess the risk of recurrent malaria and mortality within 12 months of an initial presentation with malaria in all children younger than 5 years old attending the local hospital. Analysis was primarily by Kaplan Meier and Cox regression methods.
   Results: In total 15,716 children presenting with malaria between April 2004 and December 2013 were included in the analysis; 6184 (39.3%) with Plasmodium falciparum, 7499 (47.7%) with P. vivax, 203 (1.3%) with P. malariae, 3 with P. ovale and 1827 (11.6%) with mixed infections. Within 1 year, 48.4% (7620/15,716) of children represented a total of 16, 957 times with malaria (range 1 to 11 episodes), with the incidence of malaria being greater in patients initially presenting with P. vivax infection (1334 [95%CI 1307-1361] per 1000 patient years) compared to those with P. falciparum infection (920 [896-944]). In total 266 (1.7%) children died within 1 year of their initial presentation, 129 (48.5%) within 30 days and 137 (51.5%) between 31 and 365 days. There was no significant difference in the mortality risk in patients infected with P. vivax versus P. falciparum either before 30 days (Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.02 [0.69,1.49]) or between 31 and 365 days (HR = 1.30 [0.90,1.88]). Children who died had a greater incidence of malaria, 2280 [95%CI 1946-2671] per 1000 patient years preceding their death, compared to 1141 [95%CI 1124-1158] per 1000 patient years in those surviving.
   Conclusions: Children under-5 years old with P. vivax malaria, are at significant risk of multiple representations with malaria and of dying within 1 year of their initial presentation. Preventing recurrent malaria must be a public health priority in this vulnerable population.

AB Hepatitis C infection is a global public health problem. This study was designed to identify the risk factors associated with hepatitis C infection among adult patients in Kedah state, Malaysia. A matched, hospital-based, case-control study was conducted at a tertiary hospital. Cases were adult (aged. 18 years) patients with positive serology test results for hepatitis C virus antibody and detectable hepatitis C virus RNA from January 2015 to December 2018, and controls were age-, sex- and ethnicity-matched patients who were not infected with hepatitis C virus. Self-administered questionnaires were used to collect data on demographic characteristics and previous exposure to selected risk factors among the study participants. Associations between hepatitis C and demographic and risk factors were assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. A total of 255 case-control patient pairs were enrolled. The multivariable analysis indicated that having a history of blood or blood product transfusion before 1992 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 6.99, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.73-13.81), injection drug use (AOR = 6.60, 95% CI: 3.66-12.43), imprisonment (AOR = 4.58, 95% CI: 1.62-16.40), tattooing (AOR = 3.73, 95% CI: 1.37-12.00), having more than one sexual partner (AOR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.16-3.69), piercing (AOR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.04-2.80), and having only secondary education (AOR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.06-3.57) were independently associated with hepatitis C. No associations were found between health care occupation, needle-prick injury, surgical procedures, haemodialysis, acupuncture, cupping, or contact sports and hepatitis C infection. These findings demonstrate that hepatitis C risk is multifactorial. Having a history of blood or blood product transfusion before 1992, injection drug use, imprisonment, tattooing, having more than one sexual partner, piercing, and having only secondary education were associated with increased odds of hepatitis C.

TI Perceived barriers in accessing sexual and reproductive health services
   for youth in Lao People's Democratic Republic
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CARE SERVICES; YOUNG-PEOPLE; ADOLESCENT; VIENTIANE; NEEDS
AB Background
   Sexual activity during youth is common in Lao PDR. However, young people seldom utilize sexual and reproductive health services and subsequently suffer from poor sexual and reproductive health. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore the barriers perceived by youth that prevent their access to sexual and reproductive health services.
   Methods
   Twenty-nine semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 participants aged 15-25 years, from urban and rural areas. A vignette was used during interviews with those who had no experience with sexual and reproductive health services. Additionally, seven semi-structured interviews were conducted with health providers from youth-friendly health clinics and from public sexual and reproductive health services. Data were analyzed using a thematic approach.
   Results
   The main barriers preventing young people from accessing sexual and reproductive health services were related to cognitive accessibility and psychosocial accessibility. The cognitive accessibility barriers were a lack of sexual knowledge and a lack of awareness of services. Perceived barriers in psychosocial accessibility were the feelings of shyness and shame caused by negative cultural attitudes to premarital sex, and the fear of parents finding out about visits to public sexual and reproductive health services, due to lack of confidentiality in the services and among health providers. In addition, the barriers of geographical accessibility, mainly insufficient availability of youth-friendly health clinics.
   Conclusion
   To improve access to services, a multi-component strategy is needed: promotion of youth-friendly health clinics; sexual education in schools; a formal referral system between schools and youth-friendly health clinics; and community support interventions. Prior to implementation, more research should be done on the applicability of these methods in the Laos context. Future research should try to determine the cost-effectiveness of youth-friendly health clinics integrated in a district hospital and stand-alone clinics, to provide insight into which form should be further developed.

TI Healthcare needs and programmatic gaps in transition from pediatric to

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID MEDICATION ADHERENCE; RESPONSIBILITY
AB Treatment transition for 'adolescents living with perinatally acquired HIV' (ALPH) from paediatric to adult care is not addressed adequately. This study explores the ALPH's health care needs and programmatic gaps in health systems for the care of ALPH in India. Forty-nine indepth interviews were conducted with purposively selected primary and key stakeholders in India. Thematic analysis utilizing grounded theory was performed in QSR NUD* IST 6. Stakeholders explicitly recognized adolescent HIV to be a critical public health issue which requires a separate mandate in India. It was found that none of the health policies in India focus on adolescent age group; ALPH is therefore even more neglected population. No/partial HIV disclosure to ALPH is the first crisis for retention in care continuum and adherence to the treatment becomes sub-optimal. Unmet needs of transitioning from paediatric to adult care in existing settings was the major gap. Age-specific counselling guidelines and counselling skills among HCPs were found lacking where tailored counseling and capacity building of HCPs was an expectation. Need of holistic approach for adolescents led to consensus on establishing 'adolescent transition clinic' with a strict 'no' for 'standalone Adolescent HIV' clinics. School setting having peer-based counselling provision was recommended. Age disaggregated health data is required to inform the policymakers about adolescents' specific needs for developing interventions. Situational analysis to identify and shape health priorities of adolescents is recommended.

AB Background: Hypertension (HTN) is major public health challenge. Data on HTN prevalence and associated risk factors is necessary to better control it. This study aimed at estimating the prevalence of HTN and associated anthropometric and lifestyle predictors in Kombolcha and suburbs, northeast Ethiopia.
   Methods: The study followed a community-based cross-sectional sampling design. Adult (>= 18) residents of Kombolcha and suburbs in 11 kebeles (villages) formed the target population. Of these kebeles, 5(3 urban and 2 suburban) were selected randomly. Households (HHs) within the selected kebeles and individuals within HHs were similarly recruited in December 2016-May 2017. Anthropometric and blood pressure measurements were done. World Health Organization (WHO) STEPWISE TOOL was used to capture socio-demographic, physical activity, dietary habit, and nutritional status data.
   Results: Totally 318 adults participated in the study. However, only 312 (169(54.2%) males and 143(45.8%) females) were with complete information for statistical analysis. The lowest age was 18 years, the highest 65 and the mean 38.29 +/- 10.88. The prevalence of HTN was 30.8% (96/312) ( 95% confidence interval (CI): 25.9-36.1%), 16.4% male and 14.4% female. While 45 and older age (odds ratio (OR) 7.385, 95% CI 3.563-15.306, p < 0.0001), obesity (OR 126.286, 95% CI 34.481-462.514, p < 0.0001) and overweightness (OR 16.105, 95% CI 7.024-36.927, p < 0.0001), 'substantially high risk' (> 102 cm in men and > 88 cm in female) waist circumference (OR 1.788, 95% CI 1.008-3.173, p = 047), light occupational physical activity (OR 12.427, 95% CI 2.891-53.410, p = 0.001), walking or riding a bicycle for lower than 5 days/week (OR 13.000, 95% CI 5.140-32.882, p < 0.0001) and lack of sport activity (OR 18.322, 95% CI 2.430-138.169, p = 005), smoking (OR 2.283, 95% CI 1.284-4.060, p = 0.005), khat (OR 17.390, 95% CI 6.167-49.037, p < 0.0001), alcohol (OR 4.005, 95% CI 2.357-6.803, p < 0.0001), HH size of two (OR 2.474, 95% CI 1.250-4.895, p = 0.009) and >= 3 (OR 6.889, 95% CI 2.610-18.186, p < 0.0001); and HTN in family history (OR 19.417, 95% CI 10.251-36.778, p < 0.0001) were significant predictors of HTN in the binary logistic regression analysis; none of these were so in the multivariable model.
   Conclusion: Although there was a high prevalence of HTN in the study area, its independent significant predictors were not identified.

   Methods: Leveraging a prospective, rural Ghanaian birth cohort, we ascertained prenatal maternal negative life events, categorized scores as 0-2 (low stress; referent), 3-5 (moderate), and > 5 (high) among 353 pregnant women in the Kintampo North Municipality and Kintampo South District located within the middle belt of Ghana. We employed linear regression to determine associations between prenatal maternal stress and infant birth weight, head circumference, and length. We additionally examined associations between prenatal maternal stress and adverse birth outcome, including low birth weight, small for gestational age, or stillbirth. Effect modification by infant sex was examined.
   Results: In all children, high prenatal maternal stress was associated with reduced birth length (beta = - 0.91, p = 0.04; p-value for trend = 0.04). Among girls, moderate and high prenatal maternal stress was associated with reduced birth weight (beta = - 0.16, p = 0.02; beta = - 0.18, p = 0.04 respectively; p-value for trend = 0.04) and head circumference (beta = - 0.66, p = 0.05; beta = - 1.02, p = 0.01 respectively; p-value for trend = 0.01). In girls, high prenatal stress increased odds of any adverse birth outcome (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.01-5.75; p for interaction = 0.04). Sex-specific analyses did not demonstrate significant effects in boys.
   Conclusions: All infants, but especially girls, were vulnerable to effects of prenatal maternal stress on birth outcomes. Understanding risk factors for impaired fetal growth may help develop preventative public health strategies.

AB Background: Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a major public health problem with a relative high lifetime risk of surgery. The main risk factor for developing POP is vaginal birth. Many women become symptomatic later in life and most of the existing research on symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse (sPOP) predominantly concentrates on the effects of the condition on postmenopausal women. However bothersome symptoms of POP can be reported as early as in women's 20s and may occur shortly after vaginal birth. Limited studies provide an insight into daily life of fertile women with sPOP. Thus, we aimed to explore fertile women's experiences of symptomatic pelvic organ (sPOP) after vaginal birth.
   Methods: An inductive, text-driven approach was taken by selecting thread posts from an internet forum written by 33 Swedish fertile women who had experienced sPOP after vaginal birth.
   Results: The overarching theme "being irreparably damaged" was identified as representing an experience of being disabled by sPOP after vaginal birth. The fertile women experienced that their lives were ruined because of physical and psychological limitations caused by this unexpected, unfamiliar and unexplained condition. Living with sPOP impinged on sexual health, restricted daily and sports activities and affected the women's ability to fulfill everyday parental duties. This in turn compromised women's psychological health. In addition, the negligence of healthcare professionals who tended to trivialize and normalize the symptoms led to the belief that there were no sustainable treatments and that women would have to live with bothersome symptoms of POP for rest of their lives.
   Conclusions: This study found that sPOP had a significant negative impact on fertile women's lives. The women indicated that they had not had the opportunity to voice their concerns and had not been taken seriously by healthcare professionals. It is of the utmost importance to acknowledge this problem and develop guidelines for prevention and management of sPOP to improve the quality of life for women.

AB Background: The Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting Prevention Program (CHIRPP) is a sentinel surveillance program that collects and analyzes data on injuries and poisonings of people presenting to emergency departments (EDs) at 11 pediatric and eight general hospitals (currently) across Canada. To date, CHIRPP is an understudied source of child maltreatment (CM) surveillance data. This study: (1) describes CM cases identified in the CHIRPP database between1997/98 to 2010/11; (2) assesses the level of CM case capture over the 14-year period and; (3) uses content analysis to identify additional information captured in text fields.
   Methods: We reviewed cases of children under 16 whose injuries were reported as resulting from CM from 1997/98 to 2010/11. A time trend analysis of cases to assess capture was conducted and content analysis was applied to develop a codebook to assess information from text fields in CHIRPP. The frequency of types of CM and other variables identified from text fields were calculated. Finally, the frequency of types of CM were presented by age and gender.
   Results: A total of 2200 CM cases were identified. There was a significant decrease in the capture of CM cases between 1999 and 2005. Physical abuse was the most prevalent type (57%), followed by sexual assault (31%), unspecified maltreatment (7%), injury as the result of exposure to family violence (3%) and neglect (2%). Text fields provided additional information including perpetrator characteristics, the use of drugs and/or alcohol during the injury event, information regarding the involvement of non-health care professionals, whether maltreatment occurred during a visitation period with a parent and, whether the child was removed from their home.
   Conclusions: The findings from this initial study indicate that CHIRPP could be a complimentary source of CM data. As an injury surveillance system, physical abuse and sexual assault were better captured than other types of CM. Text field data provided unique information on a number of additional details surrounding the injury event, including risk factors.

AB Background: The hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the causative pathogen of hepatitis E, a global public health concern. HEV comprises 8 genotypes with a wide host range and geographic distribution. This study aims to determine the genetic factors influencing the molecular adaptive changes of HEV open reading frames (ORFs) and estimate the HEV origin and evolutionary history.
   Results: Sequences of HEV strains isolated between 1982 and 2017 were retrieved and multiple analyses were performed to determine overall codon usage patterns, effects of natural selection and/or mutation pressure and host influence on the evolution of HEV ORFs. Besides, Bayesian Coalescent Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Analysis was performed to estimate the spatial-temporal evolution of HEV. The results indicated an A/C nucleotide bias and ORF-dependent codon usage bias affected mainly by natural selection. The adaptation of HEV ORFs to their hosts was also ORF-dependent, with ORF1 and ORF2 sharing an almost similar adaptation profile to the different hosts. The discriminant analysis based on the adaptation index suggested that ORF1 and ORF3 could play a pivotal role in viral host tropism.
   Conclusion: In this study, we estimate that the common ancestor of the modern HEV strains emerged similar to 6000 years ago, in the period following the domestication of pigs. Then, natural selection played the major role in the evolution of the codon usage of HEV ORFs. The significant adaptation of ORF1 of genotype 1 to humans, makes ORF1 an evolutionary indicator of HEV host speciation, and could explain the epidemic character of genotype 1 strains in humans.

ID PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM MALARIA; EPIDEMIOLOGIC MODEL; INFECTION; IMPACT
AB Background: The only licensed malaria vaccine, RTS,S/AS01, has been developed for morbidity-control in young children. The potential impact on transmission of deploying such anti-infective vaccines to wider age ranges, possibly with co-administration of antimalarial treatment, is unknown. Combinations of existing malaria interventions is becoming increasingly important as evidence mounts that progress on reducing malaria incidence is stalling and threatened by resistance.
   Methods: Malaria transmission and intervention dynamics were simulated using OpenMalaria, an individual-based simulation model of malaria transmission, by considering a seasonal transmission setting and by varying epidemiological and setting parameters such as transmission intensity, case management, intervention types and intervention coverages. Chemopreventive drugs and anti-infective vaccine efficacy profiles were based on previous studies in which model parameters were fitted to clinical trial data. These intervention properties were used to evaluate the potential of seasonal mass applications of preventative anti-infective malaria vaccines, alone or in combination with chemoprevention, to reduce malaria transmission, prevent resurgence, and/or reach transmission interruption.
   Results: Deploying a vaccine to all ages on its own is a less effective intervention strategy compared to chemoprevention alone. However, vaccines combined with drugs are likely to achieve dramatic prevalence reductions and in few settings, transmission interruption. The combined mass intervention will result in lower prevalence following the intervention compared to chemoprevention alone and will increase chances of interruption of transmission resulting from a synergistic effect between both interventions. The combination of vaccine and drug increases the time before transmission resurges after mass interventions cease compared to mass treatment alone. Deploying vaccines and drugs together requires fewer rounds of mass intervention and fewer years of intervention to achieve the same public health impact as chemoprevention alone.
   Conclusions: Through simulations we identified a previously unidentified value of deploying vaccines with drugs, namely the greatest benefit will be in preventing and delaying transmission resurgence for longer periods than with other human targeted interventions. This is suggesting a potential role for deploying vaccines alongside drugs in transmission foci as part of surveillance-response strategies.

ID MOLECULAR SNAPSHOT; MIRU-VNTRPLUS; SPREAD
AB Background: Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health concern threathing the success of TB control efforts, and this is particularily problematic in Central Asia. Here, we present the first analysis of the population structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates in the Central Asian republics Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan.
   Methods: The study set consisted of 607 isolates with 235 from Uzbekistan, 206 from Tajikistan, and 166 from Kyrgyzstan. 24-loci MIRU-VNTR (Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Units - Variable Number of Tandem Repeats) typing and spoligotyping were combined for genotyping. In addition, phenotypic drug suceptibility was performed.
   Results: The population structure mainly comprises strains of the Beijing lineage (411/607). 349 of the 411 Beijing isolates formed clusters, compared to only 33 of the 196 isolates from other clades. Beijing 94-32 (n = 145) and 100-32 (n = 70) formed the largest clusters. Beijing isolates were more frequently multidrug-resistant, pre-extensively resistant (pre-XDR)- or XDR-TB than other genotypes.
   Conclusions: Beijing clusters 94-32 and 100-32 are the dominant MTB genotypes in Central Asia. The relative size of 100-32 compared to previous studies in Kazakhstan and its unequal geographic distribution support the hypothesis of its more recent emergence in Central Asia. The data also demonstrate that clonal spread of resistant TB strains, particularly of the Beijing lineage, is a root of the so far uncontroled MDR-TB epidemic in Central Asia.

ID MALNUTRITION; SUPPLEMENTS; WOMEN
AB Background: The objectives of this study were to examine nutrient intakes of tuberculosis (TB) patients and to identify their associated factors.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 300 adult TB patients were surveyed in two impoverished counties in China. Nutrient intakes were evaluated through two consecutive 24-h dietary recalls and compared with the Chinese Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) 2013. The potential socio-demographic and behavioral factors were analyzed using multivariate logistic model to identify strong influential factors.
   Results: We found that mean daily energy intake was 1655.0 kcal (SD: 619.3 kcal) and 1360.3 kcal (SD: 552.1 kcal) for male and female patients, respectively. The mean daily energy intake was significantly lower than that has been recommended by DRI (i.e., 2250 and 1800 kcal for males and females, respectively), with 87.4% of the male patients and 59.9% of female patients failed to consume adequate energy. The protein intakes were 44.6 g (SD: 18.2 g) and 35.9 g (SD: 12.3 g) for male and female patients, respectively, which were lower than the recommended values by DRI (i.e., 65 and 55 g for males and females, respectively). Most male (90.8%) and female (58.4%) TB patients had insufficient daily protein intake. Further analyses suggested that mean daily intakes of many micronutrients, were insufficient, while for most of patients, intakes of vitamin E and sodium were sufficient. We identified that unemployment was a risk factor for low energy intake (p < 0.05) and out-home-eating was a protective factor for low protein intake (p < 0.01).
   Conclusions: In impoverished areas in China, intakes of macronutrients and most micronutrients in TB patients were inadequate compared with DRIs, especially for unemployed patients and patients eating at home. These findings suggested that public health actions are needed to promote education on TB patients about significance of nutritional support, and, further interventions in TB patients' nutritional intakes are also required.

AB Background: Hepatitis B virus is one of the major public health concerns globally. It is highly infectious and can be transmitted from person to person through vertically or horizontally via contaminated body fluids. Despite the provision of an effective vaccine, it remains a major problem worldwide, particularly among the developing countries.
   Methods: Online electronic databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, African Index Medicus, African Journals Online, and WHO Afro Library were searched and published articles from 2010 to June 8, 2019, were considered. Both authors independently screened articles and extracted the data. Funnel-Plots and Egger's test statistics were used to determine the presence of small-study effects and publication bias. The pooled prevalence of HBV was analyzed using the random-effects model. The possible sources of heterogeneity was analyzed through subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and meta-regression.
   Results: The overall pooled prevalence of HBV was 6% and among subgroups, pregnant women, healthcare workers, and HIV positive patients accounted for 5% for each group. Relatively low prevalence (4%) was obtained among blood donors. The Egger's test statistics (p = 0.747) indicated the absence of publication bias. In addition, from the sensitivity analysis, there was no influence on the overall effect estimate while removing a single study at a time. The level of heterogeneity was reduced among pregnant women, HIV positive and studies with unknown sampling techniques. After conducting meta-regression, province, study group, screening method, and quality of papers were identified as sources of heterogeneity.
   Conclusions: The overall pooled prevalence of HBV in Ethiopia was high. Strengthening and scaling up of the scope of the existing vaccination program and implementing novel approaches including screen-and-treat could be implemented to reduce the burden of the disease. Generally, the study can provide current prevalence estimate of HBV that could vital for intervention to tackle the disease.

SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article

ID EARLY SUPPORTED DISCHARGE; GLOBAL BURDEN; ISCHEMIC-STROKE;
   REHABILITATION; OUTCOMES; SCALE; COST; CARE
AB Background: Stroke is a health problem with serious consequences, both in terms of mortality, and after-effects affecting patient quality of life. Stroke requires both urgent and chronic management involving the entire health care system. Although large variability in the management of stroke patients have been noticed, knowledge of the diversity and the scalability of post-stroke pathways, whether it is the care pathway or the life pathway, is currently not sufficient. Moreover the link between post-stroke pathways and patients sequelae have not been yet clearly defined. All this information would be useful to better target the needs to improve stroke patient management. The purposes are to identify the post-stroke life pathways components associated with sequelae (activity limitations - main purpose, cognitive disorders, anxio-depressive disorders, fatigue, participation restrictions) at 3 months and 1 year post-stroke, to define a typology of life pathways of patients during the post-stroke year and to analyze the social and geographical inequalities in the management of stroke.
   Methods: Design: a prospective multicenter comparative cohort study with a follow up to 1 year after the acute episode.
   Participant centers: 13 hospitals in the Aquitaine region (France).
   Study population: patients diagnosed with a confirmed ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke included in the Aquitaine Observatory of Stroke (ObA2) cohort and voluntary to participate.
   Data sources are existing databases (ObA2 database and the French National Health Data System - SNDS) to collect information about care pathways, patient characteristics and stroke characteristics and Ad hoc surveys to collect information about life pathways and post-stroke sequelae. The endpoints of the study are post-stroke activity limitations evaluated by the modified Rankin score, other post-stroke sequelae (Cognitive disorders, anxio-depressive disorders, fatigue, restriction of participation) assessed by standardized and validated scales and Clusters of patients responding to pathways with common or similar characteristics.;
   Discussion: By integrating a longitudinal dimension and relying on a large cohort, the project will make it possible to identify the sources of disturbances and the factors favorable to the outcome of the life pathways, important for the planning of the offer and the management of the public policies concerning stroke pathways.

   ABUSE; YOGA
AB Background: Tobacco use, alcohol use, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption are each associated with increased cancer-risk. Psychological trauma is a common experience and a key driver of these behaviours among adults. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of trauma-informed yoga, drumming, and psychoeducation compared to control on tobacco use, alcohol use, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption among community-based adults. Secondary aims are to evaluate the effect of these interventions compared to control on psychological and physiological stress symptomology, social connection, and coping behaviour.
   Methods: Recruitment for this single-blinded randomized trial began in April 2019 in the Faculty of Health Sciences at the University of Lethbridge. Adults who consumed tobacco, alcohol, or sugar-sweetened beverages in the past month and live in Lethbridge, Alberta are being recruited using ads placed in public spaces. Participants are randomly allocated to a 12-session group yoga class, 12-session group drumming class, a 12-session psychoeducation class, or control. Participants attend an appointment in-person to fill out an online questionnaire package, provide a saliva sample, and complete physical measures pre-intervention, and 1-month and 6-months post-intervention.
   Discussion: This study provides a unique opportunity to compare the impacts of two trauma-informed body-based interventions to psychoeducation and control for cancer-risk behaviour among community-based adults. The findings can be used to develop trauma-informed group interventions to reduce cancer-risk behaviour in general populations. Results are expected in 2022.
   Trial registration: This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ISRCTN15583681 on 22 August 2019 (retrospectively registered).

   SCIENCE; MOTHERS; PROJECT
AB Background: To better understand and promote public health, participatory research with Indigenous peoples represents recommended practice, worldwide. However, due to the different ways such research is referred to, described, and used, it is unclear what might (and might not) warrant the term when collaborating with Indigenous peoples. As such, this article expands conceptual understandings of participatory research with Indigenous peoples, across timelines and regions.
   Method: Following a systematic search of 29 academic databases in April 2018, a lexical analysis of the methods sections was conducted, which were sourced from 161 publications across 107 journals.
   Results: The active involvement of Indigenous peoples in research that is expressly participatory is limited across all project phases. This might be because the ways in which Indigenous peoples were involved throughout were not reported - however, it might also be because Indigenous peoples were not involved in all project phases. Furthermore, descriptions differ by study location and publication timeframe - notably, studies in the region of the Americas chiefly refer to pandemics, surveyors, and art; and those published in the last two decades have given primacy to artifacts of interest.
   Conclusions: Findings from this corpus of data suggest participatory research with Indigenous peoples is not always described across different project phases; furthermore, it differs according to study location and publication timeframe. This offers considerable opportunity to further this important research area via alternative methodologies that award primacy to Indigenous expertise and agency.

AB Background: Tobacco smoking remains one of the biggest public health threats. Smartphone apps offer new promising opportunities for supporting smoking cessation in real-time. The social context of smokers has, however, been neglected in smartphone apps promoting smoking cessation. This randomized controlled trial investigates the effectiveness of a smartphone app in which smokers quit smoking with the help of a social network member.
   Methods: This protocol describes the design of a single-blind, two-arm, parallel-group, intensive longitudinal randomized controlled trial. Participants of this study are adult smokers who smoke at least one cigarette per day and intend to quit smoking at a self-set quit date. Blocking as means of group-balanced randomization is used to allocate participants to intervention or control conditions. Both intervention and control group use a smartphone-compatible device for measuring their daily smoking behavior objectively via exhaled carbon monoxide. In addition, the intervention group is instructed to use the SmokeFree Buddy app, a multicomponent app that also facilitates smoking-cessation specific social support from a buddy over a smartphone application. All participants fill out a baseline diary for three consecutive days and are invited to the lab for a background assessment. They subsequently participate in an end-of-day diary phase from 7 days before and until 20 days after a self-set quit date. Six months after the self-set quit date a follow-up diary for three consecutive days takes place. The primary outcome measures are daily self-reported and objectively-assessed smoking abstinence and secondary outcome measures are daily self-reported number of cigarettes smoked.
   Discussion: This is the first study examining the effectiveness of a smoking cessation mobile intervention using the SmokeFree Buddy app compared to a control group in a real-life setting around a self-set quit date using a portable objective measure to assess smoking abstinence. Opportunities and challenges with running studies with smoking participants and certain design-related decisions are discussed.
   Trial registration: This trial was prospectively registered on 04/04/2018 at ISRCTN registry: ISRCTN11154315.

ID TRANSITION; BEHAVIORS
AB Background: Health literacy is a multidimensional concept that is considered a primary public health concern. This concept is often neglected in research, and the evidence regarding health literacy in college students is limited. The aim of this study was two-fold: to determine the needs and limitations of health literacy among college students and to explore the relationships among the nine dimensions of health literacy and sociodemographic factors, including age, gender, nationality, year of study, field of study, smoking status, history of chronic diseases, use of on-campus gym, and the intention to exercise on-campus.
   Methods: This study was conducted using a cross-sectional approach. A total of 520 college students participated in this study. The average age was 21.03 years (SD = 2.29), with 47.5% males and 52.5% females. Data were collected using a demographics questionnaire and the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ). In addition to descriptive statistics, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and follow-up analyses were performed to explore any statistically significant mean differences among levels of health literacy and sociodemographic factors.
   Results: The levels of health literacy on the nine HLQ scales were lower than the levels reported in the literature. Multivariate analysis showed a significant effect of age, gender, smoking status, year of study, and field of study on the level of health literacy. Follow-up analyses revealed that female students, students from the health-related faculties, and those who do not smoke have higher levels of health literacy compared to their counterparts. A detailed comparison between the levels of the HLQ scales was made based on students' demographic characteristics. The field of study had the most prominent effect on the level of college students' health literacy; mean differences were statistically significant (p <.001), and effect sizes were large (ranging from.66 to 1.35 for the nine scales of the HLQ).
   Conclusion: College students' health literacy is influenced by demographic characteristics. Such variations could amplify some of the existing health disparities. The implications of the findings on health, health promotion, and interprofessional education are discussed.

AB Background: Skin disease is a global public health problem that often has physiological, psychological and social impacts. However, it is not very clear how to adapt to these impacts, especially psychosocial adaptation of patients with skin disease.
   Methods: We searched EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL and PsycINFO from 2009 to 2018. The following themes were extracted from the included articles: the concepts, related factors, and interventions for psychosocial adaptation of patients with skin disease. Two reviewers independently screened and analyzed.
   Results: From 2261 initial records, 69 studies were identified and analyzed. The concept of psychosocial adaptation in patients with skin disease was referred to under an assortment of descriptions. The related factors for psychosocial adaptation in patients with skin disease included the following: demographic factors (sex, age, education level, ethnicity, BMI, sleep quality, marital status, exercise amount, family history, the use of topical treatment only, personality and history of smoking); disease-related factors (disease severity, clinical symptoms, localization and duration); psychological factors (anxiety/depression, self-esteem, body image, stigma and suicidal ideation); and social factors (social support, social interaction, sexual life, economic burden and social acceptance). Despite being limited in quantity, several studies have clarified the benefits of adjuvant care in the form of cognitive behavioral training, educational training and self-help programs, all of which have become common methods for dealing with the psychosocial impacts.
   Conclusions: Based on the previous literatures, we constructed a protocol of care model for psychosocial adaptation in patients with skin disease. It not only provided the direction for developing new instruments that could assess psychosocial adaptation statue, but also a basis for helping patients adjust to changes in skin disease.

TI Knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to TB among the general
   population of Ethiopia: Findings from a national cross-sectional survey

AB Introduction
   Ethiopia is among the high-burden countries for tuberculosis (TB), TB/HIV, and drug-resistant TB. The aim of this nationwide study was to better understand TB-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) and generate evidence for policy and decision-making.
   Materials and methods
   We conducted a cross-sectional TB KAP survey in seven regions and two city administrations of Ethiopia. Eighty kebeles (wards) and 40 health centers were randomly selected for the study. Using systematic sampling, 22 households and 11 TB patients were enrolled from each selected village and health center, respectively. Variables with a value of p = < 0.25 were included in the model for logistic regression analysis.
   Results
   Of 3,503 participants, 884 (24.4%), 836 (24.1%), and 1,783 (51.5%) were TB patients, families of TB patients, and the general population, respectively. The mean age was 34.3 years, and 50% were women. Forty-six percent were heads of households, 32.1% were illiterate, 20.3% were farmers, and 19.8% were from the lowest quintile. The majority (95.5%) had heard about TB, but only 25.8% knew that TB is caused by bacteria. Cough or sneezing was reported as the commonest means of TB transmission. The majority (85.3%) knew that TB could be cured. Men, better-educated people, and TB patients and their families have higher knowledge scores. Of 2,483 participants, 96% reported that they would go to public health facilities if they developed TB symptoms.
   Discussion
   Most Ethiopians have a high level of awareness about TB and seek care in public health facilities, and communities are generally supportive. Inadequate knowledge about TB transmission, limited engagement of community health workers, and low preference for using community health workers were the key challenges.
   Conclusions
   Given misconceptions about TB's causes, low preference for use of community health workers, and inadequate engagement, targeted health education interventions are required to improve TB services.

AB With limited infection control practices in overcrowded Bangladeshi hospitals, surfaces may play an important role in the transmission of respiratory pathogens in hospital wards and pose a serious risk of infection for patients, health care workers, caregivers and visitors. In this study, we aimed to identify if surfaces near hospitalized patients with respiratory infections were contaminated with respiratory pathogens and to identify which surfaces were most commonly contaminated. Between September-November 2013, we collected respiratory (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) swabs from patients hospitalized with respiratory illness in adult medicine and paediatric medicine wards at two public tertiary care hospitals in Bangladesh. We collected surface swabs from up to five surfaces near each case-patient including: the wall, bed rail, bed sheet, clinical file, and multipurpose towel used for care giving purposes. We tested swabs using real-time multiplex PCR for 19 viral and 12 bacterial pathogens. Case-patients with at least one pathogen detected had corresponding surface swabs tested for those same pathogens. Of 104 patients tested, 79 had a laboratory-confirmed respiratory pathogen. Of the 287 swabs collected from surfaces near these patients, 133 (46%) had evidence of contamination with at least one pathogen. The most commonly contaminated surfaces were the bed sheet and the towel. Sixty-two percent of patients with a laboratory-confirmed respiratory pathgen (49/79) had detectable viral or bacterial nucleic acid on at least one surface. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequently detected pathogen on both respiratory swabs (32%, 33/104) and on surfaces near patients positive for this organism (97%, 32/33). Surfaces near patients hospitalized with respiratory infections were frequently contaminated by pathogens, with Klebsiella pneumoniae being most common, highlighting the potential for transmission of respiratory pathogens via surfaces. Efforts to introduce routine cleaning in wards may be a feasible strategy to improve infection control, given that severe space constraints prohibit cohorting patients with respiratory illness.

AB Background: Adverse childhood experiences (ACE) are associated with an array of health consequences in later life, but few studies have examined the effects of ACEs on women's birth outcomes.
   Methods: We analyzed data gathered from a sample of 1848 low-income women who received services from home visiting programs in Wisconsin. Archival program records from a public health database were used to create three birth outcomes reflecting each participant's reproductive health history: any pregnancy loss; any preterm birth; any low birthweight. Multivariate logistic regressions were performed to test the linear and non-linear effects of ACEs on birth outcomes, controlling for age, race/ethnicity, and education.
   Results: Descriptive analyses showed that 84.4% of women had at least one ACE, and that 68.2% reported multiple ACEs. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that cumulative ACE scores were associated with an increased likelihood of pregnancy loss (OR = 1.12; 95% CI = 1.08-1.17), preterm birth (OR = 1.07; 95% CI = 1.01-1.12), and low birthweight (OR = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.03-1.15). Additional analyses revealed that the ACE-birthweight association deviated from a linear, dose-response pattern.
   Conclusions: Findings confirmed that high levels of childhood adversity are associated with poor birth outcomes. Alongside additive risk models, future ACE research should test interactive risk models and causal mechanisms through which childhood adversity compromises reproductive health.

AB Background: Salmonella infection poses significant public health threat globally, especially in resource-limited countries. Emergence and spread of antibiotic resistant strains to fluoroquinolones have led to treatment failures and increased mortality in Salmonella infection. However, there is dearth of information regarding mechanisms of resistance to fluoroquinolones in Ghana. This study therefore sought to identify chromosomal mutations and plasmid-mediated resistance as possible mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance from clinical isolates in Ghana.
   Methods: This was a retrospective study of archived isolates biobanked at Kumasi Centre for Collaborative Research in Tropical Medicine, Ghana. Isolates were obtained from blood, stool and oropharynx samples at two hospitals, between May, 2016 and January, 2018. Salmonella identification was done using standard microbiological protocols and antibiotic susceptibility testing performed by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Isolates with intermediate susceptibility and/or resistance to nalidixic acid and/or ciprofloxacin were selected and examined for chromosomal mutations by Sanger sequencing and plasmid-mediated resistance by PCR.
   Results: Of 133 biobanked isolates cultured, 68 (51.1%) and 16 (12%) were identified as Salmonella Typhi and nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS), respectively. Sequence analysis of gyrA gene revealed the presence of 5 different nonsynonymous mutations, with the most frequent mutation (Ile203Ser) occurring in 12 out of 13 isolates tested. Gyrase B (gyrB) gene had 1 nonsynonymous mutation in 3 out of 13 isolates, substituting phenylalanine with leucine at codon 601 (Phe601Leu). No mutation was observed in parC and parE genes. Two NTS isolates were found to harbour qnrS plasmid-mediated resistant gene of molecular size 550 bp with high ciprofloxacin MIC of 0.5 mu g/ml.
   Conclusion: This study reports for the first time in Ghana plasmid-mediated fluoroquinolone resistant gene qnrS in Salmonella clinical isolates. Nonsynonymous mutations of gyrA and gyrB genes likely to confer Salmonella reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin were also reported.

AB Background: Several reports designate the recent increase in community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) nasal carriage. Because of the scanty information regarding the nasal carriage sate of MRSA in the west of Iran, the purpose of the present study was to determine the frequency of CA-MRSA in Sanandaj city.
   Methods: Swabs collected from anterior nares of 600 volunteers were analyzed for the presence of S. aureus. The isolates were further investigated for methicillin resistance by using the cefoxitin disk diffusion test, followed by PCR-amplification of the mecA gene. SCCmec types and the presence of the Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (pvl) encoding genes were determined through PCR. Finally, the antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates was determined by the agar diffusion method.
   Results: Nasal screening identified 181 S. aureus, of which 55 isolates were MRSA. SCCmec types IV and V were detected in MRSA at frequencies of 80 and 20%, respectively. The overall frequency of pvl genes among the MRSA isolates was 14.54%. MRSA isolates were highly susceptible (98.18%) to mupirocin, gentamicin, and fusidic acid.
   Conclusions: The high prevalence of CA-MRSA carriage in the population could pose a serious public health concern for the region. Additionally, advent of drug-resistant pvl-positive strains demands continuous surveillance on the colonization state of CA-MRSA in order to prevent dissemination of the bacterium in the community.

AB Background: Tuberculosis (TB) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) diseases are globally acknowledged as a public health challenge that exhibits adverse bidirectional relations due to the co-epidemic overlap. To understand the co-infection burden we used the case notification data to generate spatiotemporal maps that described the distribution and exposure hypotheses for further epidemiologic investigations in areas with unusual case notification levels.
   Methods: We analyzed the TB and TB-HIV case notification data from the Kenya national TB control program aggregated for forty-seven counties over a seven-year period (2012-2018). Using spatiotemporal poisson regression models within the Integrated Nested Laplace Approach (INLA) paradygm, we modeled the risk of TB-HIV co-infection. Six competing models with varying space-time formulations were compared to determine the best fit model. We then assessed the geographic patterns and temporal trends of coinfection risk by mapping the posterior marginal from the best fit model.
   Results: Of the total 608,312 TB case notifications, 194,129 were HIV co-infected. The proportion of TB-HIV co-infection was higher in females (39.7%) than in males (27.0%). A significant share of the co-infection was among adults aged 35 to 44 years (46.7%) and 45 to 54 years (42.1%). Based on the Bayesian Defiance Information (DIC) and the effective number of parameters (pD) comparisons, the spatiotemporal model allowing space-time interaction was the best in explaining the geographical variations in TB-HIV coinfection. The model results suggested that the risk of TB-HIV coinfection was influenced by infrastructure index (Relative risk (RR) = 5.75, Credible Interval (Cr.I) = (1.65, 19.89)) and gender ratio (RR = 5.81e(-04), Cr. I = (1.06e(-04), 3.18e(-03)). The lowest and highest temporal relative risks were in the years 2016 at 0.9 and 2012 at 1.07 respectively. The spatial pattern presented an increased co-infection risk in a number of counties. For the spatiotemporal interaction, only a few counties had a relative risk greater than 1 that varied in different years.
   Conclusions: We identified elevated risk areas for TB/HIV co-infection and fluctuating temporal trends which could be because of improved TB case detection or surveillance bias caused by spatial heterogeneity in the co-infection dynamics. Focused interventions and continuous TB-HIV surveillance will ensure adequate resource allocation and significant reduction of HIV burden amongst TB patients.

AB Background: In developing countries, the prevalence of psychological distress was higher among tuberculosis patients. Patients with tuberculosis infection were more prone to psychological distress than peoples without tuberculosis. However, little studies were conducted on psychological distress among tuberculosis patients in Ethiopia, particularly in the Eastern Ethiopian health institutions.
   Methods: Institution-based cross-sectional study design was conducted. Based on the TB burden, four hospitals and six health centers were selected from Dire Dawa and Harar cities. Socio-demographic factors, psychological distress, TB related stigma experience, and alcohol use data were collected by face to face interview while TB and HIV related variables collected from TB registration book. All TB patients from the first month of TB treatment initiation through 6 were consecutively interviewed by trained data collectors from January to February 2018. The collected data were entered into Epi Data Version 3.1 software and exported into SPSS window version 20 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariate binary logistic regression was carried out. All variables with P-value <= 0.25 were taken into the multivariate model. Crude and adjusted odds ratios with a 95% confidence interval were estimated, and variables with P-value less than 0.05 in the final model were taken as significant predictors of psychological distress.
   Results: The prevalence of psychological distress among tuberculosis in this study population was 63.3% (95% CI: 58.1, 68.1). Being from rural residence (AOR: 1. 98; 95% CI: 1.01,3.86), co-infection TB-HIV (AOR: 2.15; 95% CI:1.02, 4.56), presence of at least one chronic disease (AOR:3.04; 95% CI:1.59,5.79), experience of stigma (AOR: 1.71; 95% CI:1.01, 2.90), Pulmonary and MDR-TB (AOR:2.53; 95% CI:1.50,4.28) and smoking cigarette (AOR:2.53; 95% CI:1.06,6.03) were associated with psychological distress.
   Conclusions: In this study, almost two-thirds of the tuberculosis patients had psychological distress. Chronic disease morbidity, HIV-TB co-infection and experienced TB related stigma were associated with psychological distress. Attention should be given to chronic diseases including HIV/AIDS diagnosis and referring to chronic disease units to prevent the impact on mental health. Consideration should be given for psychological distress and linking moderate to severe form of the disease to the Psychiatric clinics to hinder its effects.

   STRATEGIES; FACILITATORS; PERSPECTIVES; RETENTION
AB Background: Private health facilities are increasingly being recognized as the neglected partner in the provision of HIV services. The non-adherence rate in the study sites ranged from 19 to 22%. This study explored the factors associated with non-adherence from antiretroviral therapy (ART) among adult patients accessing ART services at two privately owned urban health facilities in Malawi.
   Methods: We conducted a descriptive qualitative approach employing in-depth interviews among adults who either defaulted or were retained in HIV care in two privately owned facilities in Malawi from March to July 2017. We purposively selected participants and interviewed a total of 6 ART providers and 24 ART clients. Data were analyzed manually using a thematic approach.
   Results: Overall, participants identified four facilitators for retention in care and four broad categories of barriers namely individual, psychological, drug related and human resource related factors. The factors that facilitated retention in care included follow up visits after missing a visit, adequate information education and counseling, and supportive relationships.
   Conclusion: The main reason for defaulting from antiretrovirals (ARVs) was fear of disclosing an HIV status to avert potential stigma and discrimination. In implementing ART clinics due consideration and strategies need to be adopted to ensure that privacy and confidentiality is preserved. Although adoption of all the key Malawi Implementing strategies like expert clients and a guardian may optimize retention in care, there is need for prior analysis of how those may lead to unintended disclosure which inadvertently affects adherence. Furthermore, private facilities should orient their clients to the public facilities within the catchment area so that clients have an option for alternative access to HIV care in the event of financial constraints.

AB Background: Shisha smoking has re-emerged in the Middle East in the last two decades and has spread rapidly in these communities. Information about shisha smoking in adolescents in Sudan is deficient. Hence, the aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence of shisha smoking among adolescents and determine the associated factors.
   Methods: This study is a school based cross sectional study among secondary school students in Khartoum State - Sudan that targets both male and female students aged 14-17 years. A total of 3387 students from 29 public and private schools were selected by multi stage random sampling. The participants completed an anonymous self-administered questionnaire which was based on Arabic version of the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS).
   Results: The response rate was 100% in schools and among participants, 57.3% were females and 51.6% were from public schools. The overall prevalence of those who had ever smoked shisha was 13.4%, and among male students the prevalence was 16.8%, while it was 10.9% in females.
   The associated factors were poor academic performance OR 2.90 CI 95% (1.21-6.94), friends smoking shisha OR 2.39 CI 95% (1.65-3.45), friends smoking cigarettes OR 2.76 CI 95% (1.90-4.01), peer pressure to smoke shisha OR 13.76 CI 95% (7.86-24.07) and unexpectedly restriction of selling shisha to minors OR 2.21 CI 95% (1.28-3.82).
   Conclusion: The prevalence of those who had ever smoked shisha is among the lowest in Middle East region; therefore, regular surveillance system is needed. A well-structured peer based comprehensive tobacco control programmes that are supported by strict and rigorous anti-tobacco regulations which control both commercial and social resources of tobacco are needed to contain this issue among adolescents.

AB Background: Information on the effects of haze on health and corresponding knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) will improve self-care ability against the ill effects of haze pollution and make environmental health policies more targeted and effective. In this study, we aim to determine the KAP and information demand in the context of haze and its effects on health.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Changchun, China, between October and November 2016. A purposive sample comprising four groups (college students, occupational population, traffic police, and elderly population) were investigated. Personal information and questions pertaining to KAP and information demand on haze pollution and health were collected through questionnaire.
   Results: The questionnaire was completed by 888 residents. The awareness rate was 57.7% and varied significantly with education, exercise, and population group (p < 0.05). Among the four groups, college students scored the lowest in attitudes and practices, whereas traffic police scored the highest. Concerning the source of information demand, the elderly and traffic police preferred traditional information access (i.e., television and newspaper), whereas college students and the occupational population preferred new social media (i.e., mobile newspaper and social media sites). Regarding the most trusted department that releases information, all residents relied on the haze information released by the environmental protection department and meteorological department. The latest air quality was the most desired information of the residents.
   Conclusions: Changchun residents have a relatively high knowledge awareness rate. The elderly and less-educated residents are the targetable population for haze education. Education should be disseminated in such manner as to meet the needs of different people.

ID CONFLICTS-OF-INTEREST
AB Background: Public engagement in health technology assessment (HTA) is increasing worldwide. There are several forms of public engagement and it is not always possible to determine which stakeholders participate in the HTA process and how they contribute. Our objective was to investigate which types of social representatives contributed to the public consultation on the incorporation of Trastuzumab for early-stage breast cancer treatment within the public health system in Brazil, held in 2012 by the National Committee for Health Technology Incorporation (CONITEC).
   Methods: A mixed methods approach was used to analyze social representativeness and the composition of the corpus from the public consultation, which consisted of 127 contributions. Three types of analysis were performed using IRaMuTeQ software: classic lexical analysis, descending hierarchical classification and specificities analysis. The contributions were clustered according to the main categories of discourse observed, into four social representation categories: 1) patient representation/advocacy; 2) pharmaceutical industry/advocacy; 3) healthcare professionals; and 4) individual contributions.
   Results: Category 1 contained words related to increased survival due to use of the drug and a low score for words pertaining to studies on Trastuzumab. The word "safety" obtained a positive score only in category 2, which was also the only category that exhibited a negative score for the word "risk". Category 3 displayed the lowest scores for "diagnosis" and "safety". The word "efficacy" had a negative score only in category 4.
   Conclusions: Each category exhibited different results for words related to health systems and to key concepts linked to HTA. Our analysis enabled the identification of the most prominent contributions for each category. Despite the promising results obtained, further research is needed to validate this software for use in analyzing public contributions.

AB Background: Self-harm, an act of self-poisoning or self-injury irrespective of motivation, is a major public health concern. Use of alcohol prior to or alongside acts of self-harm is common but little is known about the alcohol-related mechanisms of self-harm enaction. We utilised an ideation-to-action approach to clarify the extent to which volitional alcohol factors differentiated those who have thoughts of self-harm but do not act on them (self-harm ideation) and those who engage in self-harm (self-harm enaction).
   Methods: Cross-sectional analyses of the baseline phase of the Health Lifestyle and Wellbeing study: 1546 adults (1079 female; Mean age = 34 y; 92% White) resident in Scotland completed measures of demographics, lifetime self-harm, volitional alcohol factors and psychosocial factors. Multinomial logistic regression compared those with a history of self-harm thoughts ('ideation', n = 297), self-harm acts ('enaction', n = 346) and 'controls' (n = 897) to identify volitional alcohol factors associated with self-harm enaction.
   Results: Volitional alcohol factors differentiated those with a history of self-harm enaction from those with a history of self-harm ideation (as well as those with no history) in initial models adjusted for demographics and depressive symptoms: the self-harm enaction group reported stronger alcohol-related negative urgency (OR = 1.74, 95% CI 1.41-2.16, p < .001), more frequent heavy drinking (OR = 1.46, 95% CI 1.24-1.72, p < .001) and stronger expectancies that drinking alcohol leads to negative self-perceptions (OR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.03-1.72, p = 0.03) and markers of self-harm risk (OR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.18-2.30, p = 0.004). Alcohol-related negative urgency and heavy-drinking frequency continued to differentiate those in the self-harm enaction group from those in ideation group in multivariate models. Consistent with theoretical models positing phase-specific moderators of self-harm ideation and enaction, psychosocial factors (perceived stress, support, negative mood regulation expectancies) differentiated those with a history of self-harm ideation from those without but not those in the ideation and enaction groups.
   Conclusions: Management of self-harm risk requires better understanding of alcohol-related mechanisms of self-harm enaction. Volitional alcohol factors may play a role in governing the translation of self-harm thoughts into self-harm acts.

   ATTITUDES; BURDEN; MODEL
AB Background: The global burden of chronic pain is growing with implications for both an ageing workforce and employers. Many obstacles are faced by people with chronic pain in finding employment and returning to work after a period of absence. Few studies have explored obstacles to return-to-work (RTW) from workers' and employers' perspectives. Here we explore views of both people in pain and employers about challenges to returning to work of people who are off work with chronic pain.
   Methods: We did individual semi-structured interviews with people who were off work (unemployed or off sick) with chronic pain recruited from National Health Service (NHS) pain services and employment services, and employers from small, medium, and large public or private sector organisations. We analysed data using the Framework method.
   Results: We interviewed 15 people off work with chronic pain and 10 employers. Obstacles to RTW for people with chronic pain spanned psychological, pain related, financial and economic, educational, and work-related domains. Employers were concerned about potential attitudinal obstacles, absence, ability of people with chronic pain to fulfil the job requirements, and the implications for workplace relationships. Views on disclosure of the pain condition were conflicting with more than half employers wanting early full disclosure and two-thirds of people with chronic pain declaring they would not disclose for fear of not getting a job or losing a job. Both employers and people with chronic pain thought that lack of confidence was an important obstacle. Changes to the job or work conditions (e.g. making reasonable adjustments, phased return, working from home or redeployment) were seen by both groups as facilitators. People with chronic pain wanted help in preparing to RTW, education for managers about pain and supportive working relationships.
   Conclusions: People with chronic pain and employers may think differently in terms of perceptions of obstacles to RTW. Views appeared disparate in relation to disclosure of pain and when this needs to occur. They appeared to have more in common regarding opinions about how to facilitate successful RTW. Increased understanding of both perspectives may be used to inform the development of improved RTW interventions.

AB Background New emerging diseases are public health concerns in which policy makers have to make decisions in the presence of enormous uncertainty. This is an important challenge in terms of emergency preparation requiring the operation of effective surveillance systems. A key concept to investigate the dynamic of infectious diseases is the basic reproduction number. However it is difficult to be applicable in real situations due to the underlying theoretical assumptions. Methods In this paper we propose a robust and flexible methodology for estimating disease strength varying in space and time using an alternative measure of disease transmission within the hierarchical modeling framework. The proposed measure is also extended to allow for incorporating knowledge from related diseases to enhance performance of surveillance system. Results A simulation was conducted to examine robustness of the proposed methodology and the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method allows robust estimation of the disease strength across simulation scenarios. A real data example is provided of an integrative application of Dengue and Zika surveillance in Thailand. The real data example also shows that combining both diseases in an integrated analysis essentially decreases variability of model fitting. Conclusions The proposed methodology is robust in several simulated scenarios of spatiotemporal transmission force with computing flexibility and practical benefits. This development has potential for broad applicability as an alternative tool for integrated surveillance of emerging diseases such as Zika.

AB Background This scoping review maps population-based surveys and mental health literacy (MHL) interventions undertaken in China during 1997-2018 in order to identify research gaps. Method Following Arksey and O'Malley's framework for a scoping review, five English databases (Medline, PsycINFO, Cochrane library, Web of Science and CINAHL) and two Chinese ones (CNKI and WanFang) were systematically searched, identifying both reports of surveys and evaluation of interventions from Jan 1997 to Oct 2018. Results MHL research has developed rapidly in China in terms of numbers of studies and geographic coverage over the past two decades. There were 350 peer-reviewed publications included in this review, covering diverse settings and participants. Of these publications, 313 (89.4%) were published in Chinese-language journals and 37 in English-language journals; 303 (86.6%) reported on survey findings and 47 reported on the evaluation of MHL interventions. MHL research in China has mainly focused on the assessment of mental health-related knowledge and beliefs. Much less attention has been given to developing and evaluating relevant interventions. MHL related to general mental health and suicide were most commonly studied, with less focus on specific disorders, although some studies covered depression, psychosis and anxiety disorders. The majority of MHL tools utilized in the studies reported in this review were developed in China (n = 97, 80.2% ) and almost half of these studies (57.8%) did not provide enough details concerning psychometrics. Conclusions More interventions targeting the general public and aiming to improve MHL and promote behaviour change, are needed in China. These should be evaluated with high-quality study designs, such as randomised controlled trials. Proper validation of tools used for measuring MHL should also be addressed in future studies.

AB BackgroundSuicide is a major public health issue worldwide. Those who have made a recent suicide attempt are at high risk for dying by suicide in the future, particularly during the period immediately following departure from a hospital emergency department. As such the transition from hospital-based care to the community is an important area of focus in the attempt to reduce suicide rates. There is a need for evaluation studies to test the effectiveness of interventions directed to this stage (termed 'aftercare' interventions).MethodsA controlled non-randomised two group (intervention vs treatment-as-usual control) design, using an intention-to-treat model, will evaluate the effectiveness of a suicide prevention aftercare intervention providing follow-up after presentations to a hospital emergency department as a result of a suicide attempt or high risk for suicide. The intervention is a community-based service, utilising two meetings with a mental health clinician and follow-up contacts by peer workers via a combination of face-to-face and telephone for four weeks, with the option of extension to 12weeks. Seventy-five participants of the intervention service will be recruited to the study and compared to 1265 treatment-as-usual controls. The primary hypotheses are that over 12months, those who participate in the aftercare follow-up intervention are less likely than controls to present to a hospital emergency department for a repeat suicide attempt or because of high risk for suicide, will have fewer re-presentations during this period and will have lower all-cause mortality. As a secondary aim, the impact of the intervention on suicide risk factors for those who participate in the service will be evaluated using pre- and post-intervention repeated measures of depression, anxiety, stress, hopelessness, belongingness, burdensomeness, and psychological distress. Enrolments into the study commenced on 1 November 2017 and are anticipated to cease in November 2019.DiscussionThe study aims to contribute to the understanding of effective interventions for individuals who have presented to a hospital emergency department as a result of a suicide attempt or at high risk for suicide and provide evidence in relation to interventions that incorporate peer-workers.Trial registrationACTRN12618001701213.

AB BackgroundAround 6% of total deaths are related to alcohol consumption worldwide. Mathematical models are important tools to estimate disease burden and to assess the cost-effectiveness of interventions to address this burden.MethodsWe carried out a systematic review on models, searching main health literature databases up to July 2017. Pairs of reviewers independently selected, extracted data and assessed the quality of the included studies. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. We selected those models exploring: a) disease burden (main metrics being attributable deaths, disability-adjusted life years, quality-adjusted life years) or b) economic evaluations of health interventions or policies, based on models including the aforementioned outcomes. We grouped models into broad families according to their common central methodological approach.ResultsOut of 4295 reports identified, 63 met our inclusion criteria and were categorized in three main model families that were described in detail: 1) State transition -i.e Markov- models, 2) Life Table-based models and 3) Attributable fraction-based models. Most studies pertained to the latter one (n =29, 48.3%). A few miscellaneous models could not be framed into these families.ConclusionsOur findings can be useful for future researchers and decision makers planning to undertake alcohol-related disease burden or cost-effectiveness studies. We found several different families of models. Countries interested in adopting relevant public health measures may choose or adapt the one deemed most convenient, based on the availability of existing data at the local level, burden of work, and public health and economic outcomes of interest.

AB Background Despite a national focus on closing the gap between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal child health outcomes in Australia, there remain significant challenges, including provision of health services in very remote communities. We aimed to identify and map child health services in the very remote Fitzroy Valley, West Kimberley, and document barriers to effective service delivery. Methods Identification and review of all regional child health services and staffing in 2013. Verification of data by interview with senior managers and staff of key providers in the Western Australian Country Health Service, Kimberley Population Health Unit, Nindilingarri Cultural Health Services and non-government providers. Results We identified no document providing a comprehensive overview of child health services in the Fitzroy Valley. There were inadequate numbers of health professionals, facilities and accommodation; high staff turnover; and limited capacity and experience of local health professionals. Funding and administrative arrangements were complex and services poorly coordinated and sometimes duplicated. The large geographic area, distances, extreme climate and lack of public and private transport challenge service delivery. The need to attend to acute illness acts to deprioritise crucial primary and preventative health care and capacity for dealing with chronic, complex disorders. Some services lack cultural safety and there is a critical shortage of Aboriginal Health Workers (AHW). Conclusions Services are fragmented and variable and would benefit from a coordinated approach between government, community-controlled agencies, health and education sectors. A unifying model of care with emphasis on capacity-building in Aboriginal community members and training and support for AHW and other health professionals is required but must be developed in consultation with communities. Innovative diagnostic and care models are needed to address these challenges, which are applicable to many remote Australian settings outside the Fitzroy Valley, as well as other countries globally. Our results will inform future health service planning and strategies to attract and retain health professionals to work in these demanding settings. A prospective audit of child health services is now needed to inform improved planning of child health services with a focus on identifying service gaps and training needs and better coordinating existing services to improve efficiency and potentially also efficacy.

AB Background With most countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) lagging behind schedule to implement a comprehensive viral hepatitis elimination strategy, several barriers to accurate information and hepatitis B virus (HBV) services still exist, that are unique to different regions. In an obstetric population of a high HBV burden SSA setting without antenatal HBV services, we systematically evaluated perceptions and prevention behavioral intentions in relation to HBV and liver cancer. Methods Eligible consenting pregnant women were recruited from public health care facilities in the central and northern regions of Uganda, between October 2016 and December 2017. Standardized procedures and instruments based on the health belief model and theory of planned behavior were used to collect data on socio-demographic characteristics, HBV perceptions and behavioral intentions. Descriptive analysis using Chi-square tests was done to obtain distribution of respondents by levels of perceived risk of HBV and liver cancer for themselves, their child under 5 years and their spouse. Modified Poisson regression analyses were used to evaluate relationships between perception variables and different behavioral outcomes (intention to screen, vaccinate and treat HBV). Results Perceived risk (PRR = 0.95(0.90-1.00), p = 0.055) was inversely associated with intention to screen for HBV. Conversely, perceived self-efficacy showed a consistent association with intention to screen for HBV (PRR = 1.18(1.10-1.23) p = 0.005), to vaccinate (PRR = 1.20(1.05-1.36) p = 0.006) and to seek treatment for HBV (PRR = 1.40(1.18-1.67) p < 0.001). Women from the north, compared to the central region (PRR = 1.76 (1.13-2.72) p = 0.012), and those who self-identified as Catholic (PRR = 1.85 (0.99-3.56) p = 0.056), and as Protestant, (PRR = 2.22 (1.22-4.04) p = 0.002), were more likely to have higher perceived self-efficacy, compared to Muslims. Age and education were not related to perceived self-efficacy. Conclusion Women in both regions hold incorrect perceptions of HBV and liver cancer risk, with women from the central reporting higher perceived risk than those from the north. High perceived self-efficacy influenced intention to participate in HBV prevention. Programs and policies geared towards enhancing HBV prevention in this sub-population may consider socio-cultural factors observed to influence prevention behaviors. These findings may guide HBV interventions aimed at improving capacity to seek HBV prevention services, thereby promoting HBV micro-elimination in this sub-population.

AB Sanitary surveys are used in low- and middle-income countries to assess water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions, but have rarely been compared with direct measures of environmental fecal contamination. We conducted a cross-sectional assessment of sanitary conditions and E. coli counts in soils and on surfaces of compounds (household clusters) in lowincome neighborhoods of Maputo, Mozambique. We adapted the World Bank's Urban Sanitation Status Index to implement a sanitary survey tool specifically for compounds: a Localized Sanitation Status Index (LSSI) ranging from zero (poor sanitary conditions) to one (better sanitary conditions) calculated from 20 variables that characterized local sanitary conditions. We measured the variation in the LSSI with E. coli counts in soil (nine locations/compound) and surface swabs (seven locations/compound) in 80 compounds to assess reliability. Multivariable regression indicated that a ten-percentage point increase in LSSI was associated with 0.05 (95% CI: 0.00, 0.11) log10 fewer E. coli/dry gram in courtyard soil. Overall, the LSSI may be associated with fecal contamination in compound soil; however, the differences detected may not be meaningful in terms of public health hazards.

AB Background People living with and beyond cancer (PLC) receive various forms of specialty care at different locations and many interventions concurrently or over time. They are affected by the operation of professional and organizational silos. This results in undue delays in access, unmet needs, sub-optimal care experiences and clinical outcomes, and human and financial costs for PLCs and healthcare systems. National cancer control programs advocate organizing in a network to coordinate actions, solve fragmentation problems, and thus improve clinical outcomes and care experiences for every dollar invested. The variable outcomes of such networks and factors explaining them have been documented. Governance is the "missing link" for understanding outcomes. Governance refers to the coordination of collective action by a body in a position of authority in pursuit of a common goal. The Quebec Cancer Network (QCN) offers the opportunity to study in a natural environment how, why, by whom, for whom, and under what conditions collaborative governance contributes to practices that produce value-added outcomes for PLCs, healthcare providers, and the healthcare system. Methods/design The study design consists of a longitudinal case study, with multiple nested cases (4 local networks nested in the QCN), mobilizing qualitative and quantitative data and mixed data from various sources and collected using different methods, using the realist evaluation approach. Qualitative data will be used for a thematic analysis of collaborative governance. Quantitative data from validated questionnaires will be analyzed to measure relational coordination and teamwork, care experience, clinical outcomes, and health-related health-related quality of life, as well as a cost analysis of service utilization. Associations between context, governance mechanisms, and outcomes will be sought. Robust data will be produced to support decision-makers to guide network governance towards optimized clinical outcomes and the reduction of the economic toxicity of cancer for PLCs and health systems.

AB Background Acute Respiratory infection accounts for 94,037000 disability adjusted life years and 1.9 million deaths worldwide. Acute respiratory infections is the most common causes of under-five illness and mortality. The under five children gets three to six episodes of acute respiratory infections annually regardless of where they live. Disease burden due to acute respiratory infection is 10-50 times higher in developing countries when compared to developed countries. The aim of this study was to assess risk factors of acute respiratory infection among under-five children attending Public hospitals in Southern Tigray, Ethiopia 2016/2017. Methods Institution based case control study was conducted from Nov 2016 to June 2017. Interviewer administered structured questionnaire was used to collect data from a sample of 288 (96 cases and 192 controls) children under 5 years of age. Systematic random sampling was used to recruit study subjects and SPSS version 20 was used to analyze the data. Bivariate and multivariate analysis were employed to examine statistical association between the outcome variable and selected independent variables at 95% confidence level. Level of statistical Significance was declared at p < 0.05. Tables, figures and texts were used to present data. Result One hundred sixty (55.6%) and 128 (44.4%) of the participants were males and females respectively. Malnutrition (AOR = 2.89; 95%CI: 1.584-8.951; p = 0.039), cow dung use (AOR =2.21; 95%CI: 1.121-9.373; p = 0.014), presence of smoker in the family (AOR = 0.638; 95% CI: 0.046-0.980; p = 0.042) and maternal literacy (AOR = 3.098; 95%CI: 1.387-18.729; p = 0.021) were found to be significant predictors of acute respiratory infection among under five children. Conclusion According to this study maternal literacy, smoking, cow dung use and nutritional status were strongly associated with increased risk of childhood acute respiratory infection. Health care providers should work jointly with the general public, so that scientific knowledge and guidelines for adopting particular preventive measures for acute respiratory infection are disseminated.

AB Introduction
   Half of all Ugandans (49%) turn to the private or private-not-for-profit (PNFP) sectors when faced with illness, yet little is known about the capacity of these sectors to deliver surgical services. We partnered with the Ministry of Health to conduct a nationwide mixed-methods evaluation of private and PNFP surgical capacity in Uganda.
   Methods
   A standardized validated facility assessment tool was utilized to assess facility infrastructure, service delivery, workforce, information management, and financing at a randomized nationally representative sample of 16 private and PNFP hospitals. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to qualitatively explore facilitating factors and barriers to surgical, obstetric and anaesthesia (SOA) care. Hospitals walk-throughs and retrospective reviews of operative logbooks were completed.
   Results
   Hospitals had a median of 177 beds and two operating rooms. Ten hospitals (62.5%) were able to perform all Bellwether procedures (cesarean section, laparotomy and open fracture treatment). Thirty-day surgical volume averaged 102 cases per facility. While most hospitals had electricity, oxygen, running water, and necessary equipment, many reported pervasive shortages of blood, surgical consumables, and anesthetic drugs. Several themes emerged from the qualitative analysis: (1) geographic distance and limited transportation options delay reaching care; (2) workforce shortages impede the delivery of surgical care; (3) emergency and obstetric volume overwhelm the surgical system; (4) medical and non-medical costs delay seeking, reaching, and receiving care; and (5) there is poor coordination of care with insufficient support systems.
   Conclusion
   As in Uganda's public sector, barriers to surgery in private and PNFP hospitals in Uganda are cross-cutting and closely tied to resource availability. Critical policy and programmatic developments are essential to build and strengthen Ugandan surgical capacity across all sectors.

AB Objective
   To comprehensively determine the prevalence of MRSA in healthy Chinese population, the influencing factors of MRSA colonization and its antibiotic resistance.
   Methods
   Articles that studied prevalence or influencing factors of MRSA carriage in healthy Chinese population were retrieved from PubMed, Ovid database, three Chinese electronic databases. The pooled prevalence of MRSA, its antibiotic resistance and influencing factors were analyzed by STATA12.0.
   Results
   37 studies were included. The pooled prevalence of MRSA was 21.2% (95% CI: 18.5%-23.9%), and the prevalence of S.aureus was 15% (95% CI: 10%-19%), with a significant heterogeneity (MRSA: I-2 = 97.6%, P<0.001; S.aureus: I-2 = 98.4%, P < 0.001). In subgroup analysis, the pooled prevalence of MRSA was 28% (95%Cl: 10%-51%) for Livestock-related workers, 18% (95%Cl: 11%-26%) for children, 20% (95%Cl: 12%-29%) for healthcare workers, 7% (95%CI: 3%-13%) for community residents. The prevalence of MRSA in studies with oxacillin disk diffusion method (28%, 95%CI: 21%-35%) seemed higher than that with the mecA gene method(12%, 95%CI: 7%-19%). MRSA in studies conducted in Taiwan was more common than in Mainland China and Hong Kong. Similar results were found in meta-regression. Influencing factors for MRSA colonization were noted in seven eligible studies, they included younger age (OR: 3.54, 95% Cl: 2.38-5.26; OR: 2.24, 95% Cl: 1.73-2.9), attending day care centers (DCCs) (OR: 1.95, 95% Cl: 1.4-2.72; OR: 1.53, 95% Cl: 1.2-1.95), flu vaccination (OR:1.73, 95% Cl: 1.28-2.35), using antibiotics within the past year (OR: 2.05, 95% CI:1.35-3.11), residing in northern Taiwan (OR: 1.45, 95% Cl: 1.19-1.77), regular visits to health care facility (OR: 23.83, 95% Cl: 2.72-209.01), household member working in health care facility (OR: 8.98, 95% CI:1.4-55.63), and contact with livestock (OR: 6.31, 95% CI: 3.44-11.57). Moreover, MRSA was found to be highly resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin, and clindamycin, with a pooled resistance ratio of 100, 93, 88, and 75%, respectively. However, no resistance were noted to vancomycin.
   Conclusion
   The pooled prevalence of MRSA was considerably high in health Chinese population. Additionally, these strains showed extreme resistance to penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin and clindamycin. Public MRSA protection measures and the surveillance of MRSA should be strengthened to reduce the spread of MRSA among hospitals, communities, and livestock.

AB Background Anemia remains a public health challenge in Ethiopia, affecting an estimated 56% of children under age 5 years, 23% of women of reproductive age and 18% of adult men. However, anemia etiology and the relative contribution of underlying risk factors for anemia remains unclear and has hindered implementation of anemia control programs. Methods/design Anemia Etiology in Ethiopia (AnemEE) is a population-based cross-sectional survey of six regions of Ethiopia that includes children, women of reproductive age, and men from regionally representative households. The survey will include detailed assessment of anemia, iron, inflammatory and nutritional biomarkers, diet, comorbidities, and other factors. The objectives of AnemEE are 1) to generate evidence for decision-making on the etiology of anemia in Ethiopia among men, women and children and 2) to simulate the potential effect of iron fortification and other interventions on the prevalence of anemia and risk of iron overload. Discussion AnemEE will provide the most comprehensive evaluation of anemia etiology in Ethiopia to date due to its detailed assessment of diet, biomarkers, infections and other risk factors in a population-based sample. By generating evidence and simulating potential interventions, AnemEE will inform the development of high-impact anemia control programs and policies.

TI The role of health and advocacy organisations in assisting female sex

AB BackgroundGlobally, female sex workers (FSWs) are considered a key population group due to the high HIV prevalence. Studies show that there are various factors in some contexts that render FSWs marginalised, which limits their access to sexual reproductive health (SRH) services. Access to SRH services are particularly challenging in countries where sex work is criminalised such as is the case in South Africa. Evidently, there are alternative ways in which FSWs in this context receive non-stigmatising SRH care through non-governmental organisations. The aim of this study was to understand the functioning of these non-governmental health care services as well as to document the experiences of FSWs utilising these services.MethodsEleven focus group discussions were held with 91 FSWs. In addition, 21 in-depth individual interviews with researchers, stakeholders and FSWs were conducted. Interview guides were utilised for data collection. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Data were analysed thematically.ResultsThe FSWs expressed challenges related to SRH care access at public health facilities. The majority felt that they could not consult for SRH-related services because of stigma. The non-governmental health and advocacy organisations providing SRH services to FSWs through their mobile facilities utilising the peer approach, have done so in a way that promotes trust between FSWs and mobile health care providers. FSWs have access to tailored services, prevention materials as well as health information. This has resulted in the normalising of HIV testing as well as SRH seeking behaviours.ConclusionThis study has established that health and advocacy organisations have attempted to fill the gap in responding to SRH care needs of FSWs amidst intersecting vulnerabilities. FSWs' engagement with these organisations has encouraged their willingness to test for HIV. However, it is important to note that these organisations operate in urban areas, thus FSWs operating outside these areas are most likely exposed to compounding health risks and lack access to tailored services.

AB Background For alcohol, the association with socioeconomic status (SES) is different than for other public health challenges - the associations are complex, and heterogeneous between socioeconomic groups. Specifically, the relationship between alcohol consumption per se and adverse health consequences seems to vary across SES. This observation is called the 'alcohol harm paradox'. This study aims to describe different patterns of alcohol use and potential problems. Next, the associations between sub-groups characterized by different patterns of alcohol use and potential problems, and age, gender, educational level, full-time employment, occupational level and income is analysed. Methods Employing data from the ongoing cross-sectional WIRUS-study, N = 4311 participants were included in the present study. Individual response patterns of the ten-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) were analysed and latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify latent groups. Next, the associations between the classes identified in the best fitting LCA-model and sociodemographic factors were analysed and presented. Results We identified three classes based on the response patterns on AUDIT. Class 1 was characterised by low-level alcohol consumption and very low probability of negative alcohol-related consequences related to their alcohol consumption. Class 2 was characterised by a higher level of consumption, but despite this, class 2 also had a relatively low probability of reporting negative alcohol-related consequences. Class 3, however, was characterised by high levels of alcohol consumption, and a high probability of reporting negative consequences of their consumption. The classes identified were systematically differentially associated with the included measures of SES, with class 3 characterised by younger age, more males and lower educational attainment. Conclusions Our findings highlight the interconnectedness of alcohol consumption and alcohol-related consequences. Furthermore, the identified classes and SES yields further insights into to intricate relationship between various socioeconomic factors, alcohol use patterns and related negative consequences.

AB Background Trachoma, caused by Chlamydia trachomatis is the leading infectious cause of blindness. It is transmitted via personal contact with infected ocular and nasal secretions by hands, fomites and eye- seeking flies. Active trachoma is more common among children aged 1 to 9 years. The objective of this study was determining the prevalence of active trachoma and associated factors among children aged 1 to 9 years in rural community of Lemo district. Methods Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March to April, 2018 in rural community of Lemo district. Multistage sampling technique was used to select 589 study participants. Data were collected by using structured pre-tested questionnaire, physical examination and observation. Binocular loupe was used to identify active trachoma cases. The data were entered by using EPi-data version 3.1 and analyzed by SPSS. Binary logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with active trachoma. Variables with p-value < 0.05 in the multivariable analysis were used to declare significance of association. Result Eighty seven (15.2%) children were positive for active trachoma. Absence of solid waste disposal pit (AOR = 2.20, 95% CI (1.12-4.37), do not use latrine as reported by respondent (AOR = 7.53, 95% CI (2.86-19.84), do not use soap for face washing as reported by respondent (AOR =2.3, 95% CI (1.32-4.12), washing face frequency as reported by respondent (AOR = 1.86, 95% CI (1.06-3.26), and family size greater than five (AOR = 1.96, 95% CI (1.06-3.67) were significantly associated with active trachoma. Conclusion Active trachoma among children aged 1 to 9 years is high. Do not use latrine, do not use soap for face washing, and face washing frequency in a day as reported by respondents and family size were associated with active trachoma. Access to adequate water and sanitation can be important components in working towards eliminating trachoma as a public health problem. Therefore, prompt measures must be taken by concerned bodies to increase access to adequate water and sanitation facilities.

AB Background Childhood and adolescent overweight, obesity and underweight have become an issue of grave concern to both the developed and developing countries in context of global burden of non-communicable diseases. Unhealthy weight status is a significant public health issue for developing countries, of which Ghana is not excluded. This study evaluated the prevalence of overweight, obesity and underweight and its related factors among school-aged children and adolescents. Methods A total of 1004 participants were randomly selected from six schools. A structured questionnaire on demography and socioeconomic status of students' parents/guardians was completed by the selected students. Anthropometric parameters were measured, and body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) were calculated. BMI-for-age z-scores were used to categorize anthropometric data of the children as underweight, normal, overweight or obese. A cut-off value of > 0.50 was used to define obesity by WHtR. Results Overweight prevalence of 13.8% and 12.6 was observed among basic school and high school students respectively based on BMI classification. Obesity prevalence of 8.8% was found in basic school students and 8.9% among high school students. Underweight was observed in 114 (11.3%) basic school students and 86 (8.6%) high school students. There was a difference in sex prevalence in unhealthy weight-behaviours; with more girls being overweight (19.4% vs 7.6%, p < 0.001) and obese (10.2% vs. 7.3%, p = 0.177) compared to boys. High WHtR found in 10.5% of basic students and 5.0% of high school students, with a statistical difference. Overweight/obesity was significantly associated with taking snacks before bed among basic school students [aOR = 10.45(5.95-18)] and high school students [aOR = 10.23(5.95-18.37)] respectively. Watching TV [aOR = 0.39(0.22-0.70)], sleeping during leisure periods [aOR = 0.43(0.23-0.81)] and bicycling as a means of transport [aOR = 0.37(0.19-0.72)] to school was protective of obesity among basic school students. Conclusion High prevalence of unhealthy weight-related behaviours was observed among school-aged children in the Bekwai Municipality. Snacking before bed was a major factor promoting obesity among school-aged children while leisure behaviours such as TV watching, and sleeping were protective of obesity. Therefore, it is recommended to promote and support healthy eating habits among school-aged children which are likely beneficial in reducing the risk of childhood unhealthy weight-related behaviours.

AB Background Socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with stroke incidence and mortality. Distribution of stroke risk factors is changing worldwide; evidence on these trends is crucial to the allocation of resources for prevention strategies to tackle major modifiable risk factors with the highest impact on stroke burden. Methods We extracted data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017. We analysed trends in global and SES-specific age-standardised stroke incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost from 1990 to 2017. We also estimated the age-standardised attributable risk of stroke mortality associated with common risk factors in low-, low-middle-, upper-middle-, and high-income countries. Further, we explored the effect of age and sex on associations of risk factors with stroke mortality from 1990 to 2017. Results Despite a growth in crude number of stroke events from 1990 to 2017, there has been an 11.3% decrease in age-standardised stroke incidence rate worldwide (150.5, 95% uncertainty interval [UI] 140.3-161.8 per 100,000 in 2017). This has been accompanied by an overall 3.1% increase in age-standardised stroke prevalence rate (1300.6, UI 1229.0-1374.7 per 100,000 in 2017) and a 33.4% decrease in age-standardised stroke mortality rate (80.5, UI 78.9-82.6 per 100,000 in 2017) over the same time period. The rising trends in age-standardised stroke prevalence have been observed only in middle-income countries, despite declining trends in age-standardised stroke incidence and mortality in all income categories since 2005. Further, there has been almost a 34% reduction in stroke death rate (67.8, UI 64.1-71.1 per 100,000 in 2017) attributable to modifiable risk factors, more prominently in wealthier countries. Conclusions Almost half of stroke-related deaths are attributable to poor management of modifiable risk factors, and thus potentially preventable. We should appreciate societal barriers in lower-SES groups to design tailored preventive strategies. Despite improvements in general health knowledge, access to healthcare, and preventative strategies, SES is still strongly associated with modifiable risk factors and stroke burden; thus, screening of people from low SES at higher stroke risk is crucial.

TI Predictors of cervical cancer screening practice among HIV positive
   women attending adult anti-retroviral treatment clinics in Bishoftu
   town, Ethiopia: the application of a health belief model
SO BMC CANCER
LA English
DT Article
DE Cervical cancer; Screening; HIV/AIDS; Health belief model
ID HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS; INSTRUMENT; KNOWLEDGE
AB Background: Cervical cancer is a global public health problem and the second most common cancer causing morbidity and mortality in Ethiopia. Few available evidences revealed that despite distribution and severity of cervical cancer among HIV-positive women and the ease with which it can be prevented, cervical cancer screening practice in Ethiopia among them is considerably low. Thus, this study aims to assess predictors of cervical cancer screening practice among HIV-positive women by applying health belief model concepts.
   Methods: Facility based cross-sectional study was conducted in Bishoftu. Data was collected from 475 women who visit the health facilities for anti-retroviral services using interviewer-administered questionnaires. Champion's revised Health Belief Model sub-scales were used as data collection tools containing sources of information, knowledge, perception on cervical cancer screening and cervical cancer screening practice as variables. Frequencies, percentage, mean and standard deviation were used to describe findings. Multi-variable logistic regression and 95% confidence intervals were considered to identify predictors of cervical cancer screening practice by controlling possible confounders.
   Results: Cervical cancer screening practice among HIV-positive women in this study was 25%. Health proffesionals were the main sources of information about cervical cancer and its screening. There was a difference between the 'ever' and 'never' screened groups in mean scores of their perceived severity, perceived benefit, perceived barrier, perceived self-efficacy, perceived threat and net-benefit towards screening (P < 0.05). Perceived self-efficacy (AOR 1.24, 95%CI 1.13-1.37), perceived threat (AOR 1.08, 95%CI 1.05-1.12) and perceived net-benefit (AOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.12, 1.24) were the predictors of cervical cancer screening practice.
   Conclusions: Cervical cancer screening practice in this study was lower than that of the recommended coverage of the target group by the national guideline (80%). This finding has an important implication for public health intervention aimed at cervical cancer prevention. Morever, womens' perceptions on cervical cancer screening had a significant influence on the utilization of cervical cancer screening service. Therefore, educational programmes geared towards severity of the case, availability of screening and helpfulness of being screened can significantly improve the uptake of cervical cancer screening.

   Inventory; Disaster resilience; Emergency response; Disaster recovery
AB BackgroundDisaster citizen science, or the use of scientific principles and methods by "non-professional" scientists or volunteers, may be a promising way to enhance public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) and build community resilience. However, little research has focused on understanding this emerging field and its implications for PHEP. To address research gaps, this paper: (1) assesses the state of disaster citizen science by developing an inventory of disaster citizen science projects; (2) identifies different models of disaster citizen science; and (3) assesses their relevance for PHEP.MethodsWe searched the English-language peer-reviewed and grey literature for disaster citizen science projects with no time period specified. Following searches, a team of three reviewers applied inclusion/exclusion criteria that defined eligible disasters and citizen science activities. Reviewers extracted the following elements from each project: project name and description; lead and partner entities; geographic setting; start and end dates; type of disaster; disaster phase; citizen science model; and technologies used.ResultsA final set of 209 projects, covering the time period 1953-2017, were included in the inventory. Projects were classified across five citizen science models: distributed or volunteer sensing (n =19; 9%); contributory (n =98; 47%); distributed intelligence (n =52; 25%); collaborative research (n =32; 15%); and collegial research (n =8; 4%). Overall, projects were conducted across all disaster phases and most frequently for earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes. Although activities occurred globally, 40% of projects were set in the U.S. Academic, government, technology, and advocacy organizations were the most prevalent lead entities. Although a range of technologies were used, 77% of projects (n =161) required an internet-connected device. These characteristics varied across citizen science models revealing important implications for applications of disaster citizen science, enhancement of disaster response capabilities, and sustainability of activities over time.ConclusionsBy increasing engagement in research, disaster citizen science may empower communities to take collective action, improve system response capabilities, and generate relevant data to mitigate adverse health impacts. The project inventory established a baseline for future research to capitalize on opportunities, address limitations, and help disaster citizen science achieve its potential.

AB BackgroundPhysical inactivity and obesity pose a major public health challenge. The aim of this study was to describe the level of physical exercise and body-mass index in college and university students, as well as to examine potential changes from 2010 to 2018.MethodsData stem from the SHoT study, a national student health survey for higher education in Norway, conducted at 4-year intervals. The SHOT studies conducted so far in 2010, 2014 and 2018, included 6053, 13,525 and 50,054 fulltime students (aged 18-35), respectively. Exercise frequency (average number of times exercising each week) was assessed in all three waves, and was used for the trend analysis. The last wave in 2018 also assessed the average intensity and duration of the exercise.ResultsOverall, students exercised less in 2018 compared to 2014, but comparable to level in 2010. The prevalence of overweight increased substantially from 2010 to 2018, but especially in the last 4years and among older female students. Less than one of four male, and one of five female students, met the recommended criteria for both exercise frequency, intensity and duration. As expected, the associations between exercise and overweight/obesity were in a dose-response manner, and strong across all three waves.ConclusionsOur findings show that the large majority of young adults fail to meet international recommendations on exercise, and that the proportion of overweight is increasing in both genders and across all age groups. We conclude that there is an urgent need for a broad approach to achieve a paradigm shift in supporting our college and university students to become more active.

AB BackgroundAdult opioid use and neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) are growing public health problems in the United States (U.S.). Our objective was to determine how opioid use disorder treatment access impacts the relationship between adult opioid use and NAS.MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional state-level ecologic study using 36 states with available Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases in 2014. Opioid use disorder treatment access was determined by the: 1) proportion of people needing but not receiving substance use treatment, 2) density of buprenorphine-waivered physicians, and 3) proportion of individuals in outpatient treatment programs (OTPs). The incidence of NAS was defined as ICD-9 code 779.5 (drug withdrawal syndrome in newborn) from any discharge diagnosis field per 1000 live births in that state.ResultsUnmet need for substance use disorder treatment correlated with NAS (r=0.54, 95% CI: 0.26-0.73). The correlation between adult illicit drug use/dependence and NAS was higher in states with a lower density of buprenorphine-waivered physicians and individuals in OTPs.ConclusionsMeasures of opioid use disorder treatment access dampened the correlation between illicit drug use/dependence and NAS. Future studies using community- or individual-level data may be better poised to answer the question of whether or not opioid use disorder treatment access improves NAS relative to adult opioid use.

TI Self-reported non-receipt of HIV test results: A silent barrier to HIV
   epidemic control in Mozambique
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID COUPLES; KENYA; RISK
AB Introduction
   People living with HIV (PLHIV) and who are aware of their HIV status can access and benefit from antiretroviral therapy (ART) with subsequent individual and public health benefits; however, many PLHIV are unaware of their HIV status. We assessed the magnitude and determinants of self-reported non-receipt of HIV test results in adults aged 15-59 years old in Mozambique.
   Methods
   We performed a secondary analysis of data from the 2015 Mozambique Immunization indicators, Malaria and HIV/AIDS (IMASIDA 2015). Eligible adults (15-59 years) from each selected household were interviewed and data on sociodemographic characteristics, HIV knowledge, attitudes and behaviors, and HIV testing history were collected. Multivariable logistic regression assessed factors associated with self-reported non-receipt of HIV test results. Population representative estimates were calculated.
   Results
   13,028 (90.8%) of 14,343 eligible participants were interviewed. A total of 6,654 (51.1%) respondents had previously been tested for HIV and were included in the analysis. Of these, 308 (4.6%; 95% CI: 3.70-5.77) self-reported not having received HIV test results. In the multivariable analysis, previous sexually transmitted infection (aOR: 2.76; 95% CI: 1.44-5.31), HIV stigmatizing attitudes (aOR: 1.96; 95% CI: 1.14-3.37), and lack of decision-making power towards health care seeking (aOR: 2.51; 95% CI: 1.39-4.52) were associated with non-receipt of HIV test results. Whereas, secondary or higher education (aOR: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.12-0.54), higher HIV knowledge (aOR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.26-0.86), and age between 30-34 and 35-39 years old (aOR 0.47; 95% CI: 0.28-0.80; and aOR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.27-0.90, respectively), were associated with receipt of HIV test results.
   Conclusions
   In this nationally representative survey, self-reported non-receipt of HIV test results was high and of public health relevance. These findings suggest adaptation of HIV counseling and testing programs emphasizing individualized approaches that target the youngest, least educated and the poorest individuals, especially those living in rural areas.

TI Double burden of maternal and child malnutrition and socioeconomic

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID OVERWEIGHT; PREVALENCE; OBESITY; INCOME
AB Child malnutrition and maternal obesity are serious public health issues in Sri Lanka. This study explores the associations between socioeconomic status and the double burden of malnutrition among school-aged children and within their household. A total of 543 primary school children aged 5-10 years (204 boys and 339 girls) in Gampaha District, Sri Lanka, were included in the analysis. The nutritional statuses of thinness, normal, overweight, and obesity for children and mothers were defined according to WHO growth references and body mass index. Maternal education, household equivalent income, and maternal employment were used as socioeconomic status indicators. The proportion of child thinness and overweight was 19.3% and 13.4%, respectively, and that of maternal overweight (body mass index >= 25 kg/m(2)) was 36.5%. A positive correlation was found between maternal body mass index and the child's body mass index for age z-score in older boys and younger girls. A multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that lower education of mothers posed a higher association with child thinness (adjusted odds ratio = 2.33, 95% confidence interval: 1.08-5.00). Mothers with overweight and obesity were less likely to have a child with thinness (adjusted odds ratio = 0.30, 95% confidence interval: 0.16-0.58). Maternal employment status and household equivalent income were not significantly, but marginally, associated with child overweight and obesity. Socioeconomic inequality combined with maternal nutritional status affected child malnutrition. These findings suggest that the underlying circumstances within households should be considered to improve child malnutrition.

AB Background: Blastocystis is one of the most common intestinal protozoa in human faecal samples with uncertain impact on public health. Studies on the prevalence of Blastocystis in HIV-positive patients are limited and dated.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out involving 156 HIV-positive patients to evaluate the prevalence of Blastocystis-subtypes by molecular amplification and sequencing the small subunit rRNA gene (SSU rDNA), to identify the risk factors for its transmission, to examine the relationship between the presence of the protist and gastrointestinal disorders. Furthermore, the evaluation of the faecal calprotectin by immunoassay from a sample of subjects was performed to evaluate the gut inflammation in Blastocystis-carriers.
   Results: Blastocystis-subtypes ST1, ST2, ST3, ST4 were identified in 39 HIV-positive patients (25%). No correlation was found between the presence of the protist and virological or epidemiological risk factors. Blastocystis was more frequently detected in homosexual subjects (p = 0.037) infected by other enteric protozoa (p = 0.0001) and with flatulence (p = 0.024). No significant differences in calprotectin level was found between Blastocystis-carriers and free ones.
   Conclusions: Blastocystis is quite common in HIV-positive patients on ART showing in examined patients 25% prevalence. Homosexual behaviour may represent a risk factor for its transmission, while CD4 count and viremia didn't correlate with the presence of the protist. The pathogenetic role of Blastocystis remains unclear and no gut inflammation status was detected in Blastocystis- carriers. The only symptom associated with Blastocystis was the flatulence, evidencing a link between the presence of the protist and the composition and stability of gut microbiota.

DE Evaluation; Surveillance system; Performance; Dangila; Ethiopia
AB Background Evaluation of a surveillance system should be conducted on regular bases to ensure that the system is working as envisioned or not. Therefore, we evaluated Dangila district's public health surveillance system performance in line with its objectives. Methods In August 2017, a concurrent embedded mixed quantitative/qualitative, facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Dangila district among 12 health facilities/sites. The qualitative part involved 12 purposively selected key stakeholders interview. A semi-structured questionnaire adapted from updated CDC guideline for evaluating public health surveillance system was used for data collection through face to face interview and record review. The major qualitative findings were narrated and summarized based on thematic areas to supplement the quantitative findings. The quantitative findings were analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2007. Results All necessary surveillance guidelines, registers and reporting formats were distributed adequately to health facilities. Only the district health office has Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan (EPRP), but not supported by the budget required to respond in case an emergency occurred. There were no regular data analysis and interpretations in terms of time, place and person. Weekly report completeness and timeliness were 100 and 94.6% respectively. The information collected was considered relevant by its users to detect outbreaks early with high acceptability. All stakeholders agreed that the system is simple, easy to understand, representative and can accommodate modifications. Written feedbacks were not obtained in all health facilities. The supervision checklist obtained in the district was not adequate to assess surveillance activities in detail. The calculated positive predictive value for malaria was 11%. Conclusions The surveillance system was simple, useful, flexible, acceptable and representative. Report completeness and timelines were above the national and international targets. However, the overall implementation of the system in the district was not satisfactory to achieve the intended objective of surveillance for public health action due to the lack of regular data analysis and feedback dissemination. To create a well-performing surveillance system, regular supervision and epidemiologically analyzed and interpreted feedback system is mandatory.

AB Background Diarrhea is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, yet incidence and etiology data are limited. We conducted laboratory-based diarrhea surveillance in Guatemala. Methods A diarrhea case was defined as >= 3 loose stools in a 24-h period in a person presenting to the surveillance facilities. Epidemiologic data and stool specimens were collected. Specimens were tested for bacterial, parasitic, and viral pathogens. Yearly incidence was adjusted for healthcare seeking behaviors determined from a household survey conducted in the surveillance catchment area. Results From November 2008 to December 2012, the surveillance system captured 5331 diarrhea cases; among these 1381 (26%) had specimens tested for all enteric pathogens of interest. The adjusted incidence averaged 659 diarrhea cases per 10,000 persons per year, and was highest among children aged < 5 years, averaging 1584 cases per 10,000 children per year. Among 1381 (26%) specimens tested for all the pathogens of interest, 235 (17%) had a viral etiology, 275 (20%) had a bacterial, 50 (4%) had parasites, and 86 (6%) had co-infections. Among 827 (60%) specimens from children aged < 5 years, a virus was identified in 196 (23%) patients; 165 (20%) had norovirus and 99 (12%) rotavirus, including co-infections. Among 554 patients aged >= 5 years, 103 (19%) had a bacterial etiology, including diarrheagenic Escherichia coli in 94 (17%) cases, Shigella spp. in 31 (6%), Campylobacter spp. in 5 (1%), and Salmonella spp. in 4 (1%) cases. Detection of Giardia and Cryptosporidium was infrequent (73 cases; 5%). Conclusions There was a substantial burden of viral and bacterial diarrheal diseases in Guatemala, highlighting the importance of strengthening laboratory capacity for rapid detection and control and for evaluation of public health interventions.

AB Background Childhood obesity is a serious public health concern worldwide. Community-based obesity prevention interventions offer promise due to their focus on the broader social, cultural and environmental contexts rather than individual behaviour change and their potential for sustainability and scalability. This paper aims to determine the effectiveness of a South Australian community-based, multi-setting, multi-strategy intervention, OPAL (Obesity Prevention and Lifestyle), in increasing healthy weight prevalence in 9 to 11-year-olds. Methods A quasi-experimental repeated cross-sectional design was employed. This paper reports on the anthropometric, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and behaviour outcomes of primary school children (9-11 years) after 2-3 years of intervention delivery. Consenting children from primary schools (20 intervention communities, INT; 20 matched comparison communities, COMP) completed self-report questionnaires on diet, activity and screen time behaviours. HRQoL was measured using the Child Health Utility 9D. Body Mass Index (BMI) z-score and weight status were determined from children's measured height and weight. A multilevel mixed-effects model, accounting for clustering in schools, was implemented to determine intervention effect. Sequential Bonferroni adjustment was used to allow for multiple comparisons of the secondary outcomes. Results At baseline and final, respectively, 2611 and 1873 children completed questionnaires and 2353 and 1760 had anthropometric measures taken. The prevalence of children with healthy weight did not significantly change over time in INT (OR 1.11, 95%CI 0.92-1.35, p = 0.27) or COMP (OR 0.85, 95%CI 0.68-1.06, p = 0.14). Although changes in the likelihood of obesity, BMI z-score and HRQoL favoured the INT group, the differences were not significant after Bonferroni adjustment. There were also no significant differences between groups at final for behavioural outcomes. Conclusions OPAL did not have a significant impact on the proportion of 9 to 11-year-olds in the healthy weight range, nor children's BMI z-score, HRQoL and behaviours. Long-term, flexible community-based program evaluation approaches are required .

AB Background Several studies have reported an association between improvements in hand hygiene and the reductions in rates of intestinal parasitic diseases. However, only a some have addressed its link to the frequency of influenza-like illness. The current study aimed to find the correlation between personal hygiene habits and the frequency of influenza-like illness. Methods A cross-sectional study targeting 3000 participants conducted in Riyadh city, Saudi Arabia. A systematic random sampling methodology was applied for participant from different part of Riyadh city using a computer generating system. The researcher first started by calling each participant. A full explanation was given to each participant in details (from the purpose of the research, consent to answer the questionnaire, to the explanation of the outcome definition). Each point of the questionnaire was explained to them to make sure they had excellent comprehension, and therefore, respond accurately. Descriptive statistics and Odds Ratio and its 95% confidence intervals were used to determine the association between frequency of influenza-like illness and the studied variables. Results Two thousand eighty-two (69.4%) completed the questionnaire. The participants who spent 5-10 s in handwashing with soap and rubbing were at increased risk of more frequent influenza-like illness (odds ratio = 1.37, 1.08-1.75). Handwashing with soap and rubbing after handshaking is an independent protective habit against frequent influenza-like illness (adjusted OR = 0.59, 0.37-0.94). Conclusion The decrease of the frequency of influenza-like illness could be done through the following: getting the influenza vaccine annually, washing hands with soap and hand rubbing not less than 15 s after getting out of the bathroom, before and after handshaking and before eating. Soap companies should invent soaps that take less rubbing time to kill bacteria, and subsequently may maximize compliance in the community.

DE Tuberculosis; Prevention; HIV; Chemoprophylaxis; Health policy
AB Background Uptake of Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT) among People Living with HIV in Zambia has continued to be low despite various evidence for its added benefit in reducing TB incidence and mortality when taken with antiretroviral therapy. In 2017, only 18% of People Living with HIV newly enrolled in care were initiated on IPT in Zambia. Main text Various challenges including policy and management level factors, supply chain factors, health worker perceptions about IPT, monitoring and evaluation factors and limited demand creation activities have constrained the scale up of IPT in Zambia. Lessons that have been learnt while addressing the above challenges are shared and they can be applied by government ministries, project managers, public health specialists to strengthen IPT activities in their settings. Conclusion Zambia has both a high burden of TB and HIV and without preventing new cases of TB from reactivation of latent TB infection, it will be difficult to control TB. All stakeholders involved in prevention of TB among PLHIV need to commit to addressing the challenges limiting scale up of IPT.

Methods A cross-sectional data of 114,082 (57,680 men and 56,402 women) middle-aged adults and elderly in Taiwan were collected from 2001 to 2010. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the associations between lifestyle factors and CVD risk factors. The relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) and the attributable proportion due to interaction were used to explore the interactive effect of lifestyle factors on CVD risk factors. Results The interaction between alcohol consumption and smoking exhibited an excess risk of high triglycerides (RERI = 0.21; 95% CI: 0.14-0.29), and that of alcohol consumption and physical activity had an excess risk of high LDL-cholesterol (RERI = 0.11; 95% CI: 0.06-0.16) and high blood glucose (RERI = 0.05; 95% CI: 0.01-0.11). Alcohol consumption and vegetable-rich diet (intake of high vegetables with no or low meat) had an excess risk of high LDL-cholesterol and low HDL-cholesterol, but a reduced risk of high triglycerides (RERI = - 0.10; 95% CI: - 0.17 - -0.04). Smoking and physical activity had an increased risk of high blood glucose and a reduced risk of low HDL-cholesterol. Smoking and vegetable-rich diet reduced the risk of high triglycerides (RERI = - 0.11; 95% CI: - 0.18 - - 0.04), high blood glucose (RERI = - 0.14; 95% CI: - 0.21 - - 0.07) and low HDL-cholesterol (RERI = - 0.10; 95% CI: - 0.19 - -0.01). Conclusions The interaction between smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity and diet were associated with lipid profile and blood glucose, hence there was an interaction between these lifestyle factors in an additive scale. Public health promotion should therefore consider multifaceted promotional activities that are likely to make a positive impact on the health status of the Taiwanese population.

TI Drinking patterns and the distribution of alcohol-related harms in
   Ireland: evidence for the prevention paradox
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH

DE Alcohol; Drinking patterns; Harm; Population studies; Prevention
   paradox; Ireland
ID CONSUMPTION; NONRESPONSE; BURDEN
AB Background According to the prevention paradox, the majority of alcohol-related harms in the population occur among low-to-moderate risk drinkers, simply because they are more numerous in the population, although high-risk drinkers have a higher individual risk of experiencing alcohol-related harms. In this study we explored the prevention paradox in the Irish population by comparing alcohol-dependent drinkers (high-risk) to low-risk drinkers and non-dependent drinkers who engage in heavy episodic drinking (HED). Methods Data were generated from the 2013 National Alcohol Diary Survey (NADS), a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of Irish adults aged 18-75. Data were available for 4338 drinkers. Respondents dependent on alcohol (as measured by DSM-IV criteria), respondents who engaged in monthly HED or occasional HED (1-11 times a year) and low-risk drinkers were compared for distribution of eight alcohol-related harms. Results Respondents who were dependent on alcohol had a greater individual risk of experiencing each harm (p < .0001). The majority of the harms in the population were accounted for by drinkers who were not dependent on alcohol. Together, monthly and occasional HED drinkers accounted for 62% of all drinkers, consumed 70% of alcohol and accounted for 59% of alcohol-related harms. Conclusions Our results indicate that the majority of alcohol consumption and related harms in the Irish population are accounted for by low- and moderate-risk drinkers, and specifically by those who engage in heavy episodic drinking. A population-based approach to reducing alcohol-related harm is most appropriate in the Irish context. Immediate implementation of the measures in the Public Health (Alcohol) Act (2018) is necessary to reduce alcohol-related harm in Ireland.

AB Background Studies of the relationship between diverse populations, healthcare access and health outcomes have been dominated by approaches focusing on ethno-national groups or specific healthcare sectors. Healthcare bricolage conceptualises the processes by which individuals use multiple resources to address health concerns. It is relevant in superdiverse neighbourhoods with complex populations. This paper is original in its application of mixed methods to examine the extent to which, and the reasons why, individuals engage in healthcare bricolage. Methods The study utilized a parallel sequential methodology. Eight superdiverse neighbourhoods were selected, two in each of Bremen, Birmingham, Lisbon and Uppsala. Ethnographic research scoping the nature of each healthcare ecosystem was followed by 160 interviews (20 each neighbourhood) with a maximum variation sample of residents undertaken October 2015 to December 2016. Interviewees were asked to recall a health concern and describe actions taken to attempt resolution. Data was coded with a MAXQDA codebook checked for inter-coder reliability. Interview findings enabled identification of five types of bricolage, the nature of healthcare resources utilised and the factors which influenced residents' tactics. Results were used to design a household survey using new questions and validated epidemiological instruments implemented January to October 2017. Respondents were identified using random address files and interviewed in person or by telephone. Multinomal logistic regressions were used to estimate the effect of changing the values of determinants on the probability of observing an outcome. Results Age, gender, level of education, migration background and extent of functional limitation were associated with bricolage tactics. Individuals demonstrating high levels of agency were more likely than those with low levels to engage in bricolage. Residents with high levels of trust in physicians were less likely to bricolage than those with lower levels of trust. Levels of health literacy showed no significant effects. Conclusions The nature and severity of health concern, trust in physicians and agency shaped residents' bricolage tactics. The concept of bricolage enabled us to make visible the actions and resources utilised around public healthcare systems that would otherwise remain outwith healthcare access research. Actions were frequently undertaken via networks offering insights into healthcare-seeking behaviour.

AB Background Vaccination misinformation is associated with serious public health consequences, such as a decrease in vaccination rates and a risk of disease outbreaks. Although social media offers organisations promoting vaccination unparalleled opportunities to promote evidence and counterbalance misinformation, we know relatively little about their internal workings. The aim of this paper is to explore the strategies, perspectives and experiences of communicators working within such organisations as they promote vaccination and respond to misinformation on social media. Methods Using qualitative methods, we purposively sampled 21 participants responsible for routine social media activity and strategy from Australian organisations actively promoting vaccination on social media, including government health departments, local health services, advocacy groups, professional associations and technical/scientific organisations. We conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews to explore their perspectives and practices. Applying Risk Communication principles as a lens, we used Framework Analysis to explore the data both inductively and deductively. Results Organisations promoting vaccination face multiple challenges on social media, including misinformation, anti-science sentiment, a complex vaccination narrative and anti-vaccine activists. They developed a range of sophisticated strategies in response, including communicating with openness in an evidence-informed way; creating safe spaces to encourage audience dialogue; fostering community partnerships; and countering misinformation with care. Conclusions We recommend that communicators consider directly countering misinformation because of the potential influence on their silent audience, i.e. those observing but not openly commenting, liking or sharing posts. Refutations should be straightforward, succinct and avoid emphasizing misinformation. Communicators should consider pairing scientific evidence with stories that speak to audience beliefs and values. Finally, organisations could enhance vaccine promotion and their own credibility on social media by forming strong links with organisations sharing similar values and goals.

AB Background Despite many recent studies on burn-out and dissatisfaction among American medical doctors, less is known about doctors in the Scandinavian public health service. The aims of this study were to analyse long-term work-related predictors of life satisfaction among established doctors in Norway and to identify predictors in a subgroup of doctors who reported a decline in life satisfaction. Methods Two nationwide cohorts of doctors (n = 1052), who graduated medical school 6 years apart, were surveyed at graduation from medical school (T1, 1993/94 and 1999), and 4 (T2), 10 (T3), and 15 (T4) years later. Work-related predictors of life satisfaction (three items) obtained at T2 to T4 were analysed. Individual and lifestyle confounders were controlled for using mixed-models repeated-measures analyses, and logistic regression analyses were applied to identify predictors of the decrease in life satisfaction. Results Ninety per cent (947/1052) responded at least once, and 42% (450/1052) responded at all four times. Work-related predictors of higher life satisfaction in the adjusted model were work-home stress (beta = - 0.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] = - 0.25 to - 0.16, p < 0.001), perceived job demands (beta = - 0.10, CI = - 0.15 to - 0.05, p < 0.001), and colleague support (beta = 0.05, CI = 0.04 to 0.07, p < 0.001). The new adjusted individual predictors that we identified included female gender, reality weakness trait, and problematic drinking behaviour. Neuroticism trait and low colleague support predicted a decrease in life satisfaction. Conclusions Work-home stress, perceived job demands, and colleague support were the most important predictors of life satisfaction related to doctors' work. When personality traits were controlled for, female doctors were more satisfied with their life than male doctors. These findings suggest that improving work-related factors with targeted interventions, including a supportive work environment, may increase life satisfaction among doctors.

AB Background Violence against women has particular importance for women's health and wellbeing in the Arab world, where women face persistent barriers to social, political and economic equality. This review aims to summarize what is known about the prevalence of physical, sexual and emotional/psychological intimate partner violence (IPV) against women in the 22 countries of the Arab League, including geographic coverage, quality and comparability of the evidence. Methods A systematic review of IPV prevalence in Arab countries was carried out among peer-reviewed journal articles and national, population-based survey reports published by international research programmes and/or governments. Following PRISMA guidelines, Medline and the Social Sciences Citation Index were searched with Medical Subject Headings terms and key words related to IPV and the names of Arab countries. Eligible sources were published between January 2000 and January 2016, in any language. United Nations databases and similar sources were searched for national surveys. Study characteristics, operational definitions and prevalence data were extracted into a database using Open Data Kit Software. Risk of bias was assessed with a structured checklist. Results The search identified 74 records with population or facility-based IPV prevalence data from eleven Arab countries, based on 56 individual datasets. These included 46 separate survey datasets from peer-reviewed journals and 11 national surveys published by international research programmes and/or governments. Seven countries had national, population-based IPV estimates. Reported IPV prevalence (ever) ranged from 6% to more than half (59%) (physical); from 3 to 40% (sexual); and from 5 to 91% (emotional/ psychological). Methods and operational definitions of violence varied widely, especially for emotional/psychological IPV, limiting comparability. Conclusions IPV against women in Arab countries represents a public health and human rights problem, with substantial levels of physical, sexual and emotional/psychological IPV documented in many settings. The evidence base is fragmented, however, suggesting a need for more comparable, high quality research on IPV in the region and greater adherence to international scientific and ethical guidelines. There is a particular need for national, population-based data to inform prevention and responses to violence against women, and to help Arab countries monitor progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.

AB Background No reliable and comprehensive study has been published on the incidence and epidemiological profile of meningitis in Iran from 2008 to 2014, before pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and pentavalent vaccine (DTPw-Hep B-Hib (PRP-T) vaccine (pentavac) (adsorbed)) introduction. The present study aimed to portray the epidemiological profile of meningitis in Iran from 2008 to 2014. Methods Data on meningitis cases aged from 1 day to 110 years were extracted from national notifiable diseases surveillance system from March 2008 to December 2014 in Iran. A total number of 48,006 cases of suspected meningitis were identified and 1468 cases of which met the criteria for diagnosis-confirmed meningitis. Of 1468 cases, 1352 patients were included in the study. Results The great number of cases reported from urban areas. Moreover, males were more predominant than females (58.51% vs. 33.81%) in total. The estimated annual incidence rate of meningitis varied from 0.28/100000 in 2008 to 0.09/100000 in 2014. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis were the most leading pathogens causing bacterial meningitis, accounted for 266(23.44%), 145(12.78%), 95(8.37%) of cases, respectively. Each of the three bacterial species showed a descending trend. The majority of infected subjects are children under five years. Conclusions Unlike the decreasing trend of meningitis and high percentage of cultures with negative results, according to World Health Organization recommendation PCV introduction into routine immunization is evident. Implementing an enhanced surveillance system to provide high quality data on epidemiological profile of meningitis in Iran is necessary.

AB Background Incidence of breast cancer in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has increased in recent years. Screening helps in early detection of cancer and early diagnosis and timely treatment of breast cancer lead to a better prognosis. Women in the healthcare profession can have a positive impact on the attitudes, beliefs, and practices of general public. Therefore, it is important that the healthcare workers themselves have adequate knowledge and positive attitudes. We conducted a study to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to breast cancer screening among female healthcare professionals. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on female health professional of KFMC (King Fahad Medical City). Data was collected using a pre-designed, tested, self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire included specific sections to test the participants' knowledge, attitude, and practices related to cervical cancer and its screening. Data analysis was done using descriptive statistics. Results A total of 395 health care workers participated in this study. The mean age of the participants was 34.7 years. Participants included physicians (n = 63, 16.0%), nurses (n = 261, 66.1%), and allied health workers (n = 71, 18.0%). Only 6 (1.5%) participants had a good level of knowledge of breast cancer and 104 (26.8%) participants demonstrated a fair level of knowledge. Overall, 370 (93.7%), 339 (85.8%), and 368 (93.2%) participants had heard of breast self-examination, clinical breast examination, and mammography, respectively. A total of 295 (74.7%) participants reported practicing breast self-examination, 95 (24.1%) had undergone clinical breast examination, and 74 (18.7%) had ever undergone mammography. Conclusion The knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to breast cancer screening were found to be lower than expected. Active steps are required to develop educational programs for the health care staff, which might empower them to spread the knowledge and positively influence the attitudes of female patients in the hospital.

TI Facilitators and barriers to traditional medicine use among cancer
   patients in Malawi
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID COMPLEMENTARY
AB Background
   Increasing access to conventional cancer treatment (CT) in low-income countries (LICs) is an important public health initiative to address the global burden of cancer. However, LICs have a high prevalence of use of traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM). It is important to consider the factors that influence a patient's choice to use T&CM, CT, or both for their cancer treatment.
   Methods
   We conducted focus groups among adult cancer patients in Lilongwe, Malawi to identify facilitators and barriers of T&CM use. Focus groups were recorded, transcribed, translated, and underwent thematic content analysis.
   Results
   Cultural norms, T&CM access, T&CM success, and CT failure were all identified as facilitators to T&CM use. CT success and T&CM failure were identified as barriers. Access and norms appear to determine initial treatment selection, while treatment outcomes dictate continued use of T&CM or CT.
   Conclusion
   This study identified a pragmatic and experience-based treatment selection process that aligns with the social cognitive theory of behavior and assists in comprehending the factors that influence T&CM use among cancer patients in a low resource setting.

TI Age, sex and primary care setting differences in patients' perception of
   community healthcare seeking behaviour towards health services
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MENTAL-HEALTH; GENDER; KNOWLEDGE; PAIN
AB Introduction
   Understanding the potential determinants of community healthcare seeking behaviour helps in improving healthcare utilisation and health outcomes within different populations. This in turn will aid the development of healthcare policies and planning for prevention, early diagnosis and management of health conditions.
   Objective
   To evaluate patients' perception of community healthcare seeking behaviour towards both acute and preventive physical and psychosocial health concerns by sex, age and type of primary care setting (as a proxy for affordability of healthcare).
   Methods
   A total of 3979 patients from 221 public and 239 private clinics in Malaysia were interviewed between June 2015 and February 2016 using a patient experience survey questionnaire from the Quality and Cost of Primary Care cross-sectional study. Multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for the complex survey design was used.
   Results
   After adjusting for covariates, more women than men perceived that most people would see their general practitioners for commonly consulted acute and preventive physical and some psychosocial health concerns such as stomach pain (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 1.64; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.22-2.21), sprained ankle (AOR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.06-1.56), anxiety (AOR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.12-1.55), domestic violence (AOR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.13-1.62) and relationship problems (AOR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.02-1.51). There were no significant differences in perceived healthcare seeking behaviour by age groups except for the removal of a wart (AOR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.12-1.76). Patients who visited the public clinics had generally higher perception of community healthcare seeking behaviour for both acute and preventive physical and psychosocial health concerns compared to those who went to private clinics.
   Conclusions
   Our findings showed that sex and healthcare affordability differences were present in perceived community healthcare seeking behaviour towards primary care services. Also perceived healthcare seeking behaviour were consistently lower for psychosocial health concerns compared to physical health concerns.

AB Background The level of socioeconomic-related inequality in physical activity in Iran is largely unknown. This study investigates socioeconomic-related inequality in poor-physical activity (PPA) among Iranian adults. Methods A total of 129,257 adult participants enrolled in the PERSIAN (Prospective Epidemiological Research Studies in IrAN) Cohort were included in this study. Physical activity of adults was measured using metabolic equivalent rates (METs). Physical activity less than 41 METs/hour/day was considered PPA. The Concentration index (C) was used to quantify socioeconomic-related inequality in PPA. Moreover, the C was decomposed to identify the relative contribution of explanatory variables to inequality in PPA. Results There were significant regional variations in physical activity level among Iranian adults (29.8-76.5%). The positive value of C (0.098, 95% CI = 0.092 to 0.104) suggested that the higher concentration of PPA among higher socioeconomic status (SES) adults in Iran which was consistently observed in all cohort sites. Conclusions The higher prevalence of PPA among Iranian adults, especially, women and older adults, warrant further public health attention. Since PPA is concentrated more among the high-SES population in Iran, strategies for the promotion of physical activity should focus more on economically well-off population.

AB Background HIV infection is a growing public health problem in Sierra Leone and the wider West Africa region. The countrywide HIV prevalence was estimated at 1.7% (67,000 people), with less than 30% receiving life-saving ART in 2016. Thus, HIV-infected patients tend to present to health facilities late, with high mortality risk. Methods We conducted a prospective study of HIV inpatients aged >= 15 years at Connaught Hospital in Freetown-the main referral hospital in Sierra Leone-from July through September 2017, to assess associated factors and predictors of HIV-related mortality. Results One hundred seventy-three HIV inpatients were included, accounting for 14.2% (173/1221) of all hospital admissions during the study period. The majority were female (59.5%, 70/173), median age was 34 years, with 51.4% (89/173) of them diagnosed with HIV infection for the first time during the current hospitalization. The most common admitting diagnoses were anemia (48%, 84/173), tuberculosis (24.3%, 42/173), pneumonia (17.3%, 30/173) and diarrheal illness (15.0%, 26/173). CD4 count was obtained in 64.7% (112/173) of patients, with median value of 87 cells/mu L (IQR 25-266), and was further staged as severe immunosuppression: CD4 < 100 cells/mu L (50%, 56/112); AIDS: CD4 < 200 cells/mu L (69.6%, 78/112); and late-stage HIV disease: CD4 < 350 cells/mu L (83%, 93/112). Fifty-two patients (30.1%, 52/173) died during hospitalization, 23% (12/52) of them within the first week. The leading causes of death were anemia (23.1%, 12/52), pneumonia (19.2%, 10/52), diarrheal illness (15.4%, 8/52) and tuberculosis (13.6%, 7/52). Neurological symptoms, i.e., loss of consciousness (p = 0.04) and focal limb weakness (p = 0.04); alcohol use (p = 0.01); jaundice (p = 0.02); cerebral toxoplasmosis (p = 0.01); and tuberculosis (p = 0.04) were significantly associated with mortality; however, only jaundice (AOR 0.11, 95% CI [0.02-0.65]; p = 0.01) emerged as an independent predictor of mortality. Conclusion HIV-infected patients account for a substantial proportion of admissions at Connaught Hospital, with a high morbidity and in-hospital mortality burden. These findings necessitate the implementation of specific measures to enhance early HIV diagnosis and expand treatment access to all HIV-infected patients in Sierra Leone.

AB Background There is a lack of data on smoking in outdoor-open bars in Nigeria that may translate into effective legislation on public smoking. Method This study determined the prevalence, demographic and clinical correlates as well as predictors of smoking among a community sample of 1119 patrons of open place bars in Ibadan, Nigeria. Data on current smoking was obtained using the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), while smoking intensity was calculated using the Pack-Year. Prevalence of alcohol use was determined using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), while depression was diagnosed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatry Interview (MINI). Analysis was carried out by SPSS version 20.0 software using Chi square statistics, t test and ANOVA, and was set at 95% confidence interval. Results Prevalence of current smoking was 63.8% and the mean pack years of smoking of all respondents was 19.38 +/- 17.16 years. Predictors of outdoor smoking were depression OR = 1.41, 95% CI (1.09-1.83) and alcohol use OR = 2.12, 95% CI (1.44-3.13). Predictors of high pack years were depression OR = 1.47, 95% CI (1.08-2.01), being married, OR = 1.78, 95% CI (1.29-2.45), high income, OR = 1.95, 95% CI (1.42-2.68) and alcohol use OR = 2.82, 95% CI (1.51-5.27). There was no significant relationship between stage of readiness to quit smoking and mean pack years of smoking, F = 0.3, p = 0.5. Conclusion The high prevalence of outdoor smoking in the sample calls for urgent public health initiatives for intervention. Thus, outdoor bars are potential tobacco use intervention sites to minimize the health consequences of smoking.

AB Background Falls and fall-related injuries exacerbate the health problems of older adults, and they are a public health concern. Despite an abundance of research, the implementation of evidence-based fall prevention programs has been slow and limited, additionally and these programs have not reduced the incidence of falling. Therefore, the primary objective of the present study was to examine patients and physiotherapists' views on the factors that influence the implementation of the community- and evidence-based Otago Exercise Programme for fall prevention. Methods We conducted eight in-depth interviews with physiotherapists and patients, and a focus group interview with 12 physiotherapists and authority figures who represented local hospitals and municipalities. The resultant qualitative data were subjected to thematic analysis. Results The analysis yielded two main themes: the researcher's role and position in the implementation process and the tension between research-based knowledge and clinical practice. The participants believed that research-based knowledge can address the challenges of clinical practice. Further, the patients reported that the fall prevention program made them feel safe and enhanced their ability to cope with daily life. The physiotherapists also observed that research findings do not readily translate into clinical practice. Further, they contended that research-based knowledge is not universal and that it cannot be generalized across different contexts; instead, it must be adapted and translated into a user-friendly language. The findings suggest that the application of research-based knowledge does equate to filling up empty jars and that research-based knowledge does not flow from the expert to the non-expert as water through a tube. Indeed, physiotherapists and patients are not tabula rasa. Additionally, the participants believed that researchers and stakeholders must think critically about who has the power and voice to create a common understanding. Conclusions Our findings delineate the means by which the gap between research and practice regarding the Otago fall prevention program can bridged. The program can guide clinical work and provide important information that can be used to improve the quality of other fall prevention programs. However, the research-based knowledge that it confers must be adapted for use in clinical contexts.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB Background Delayed diagnosis of Oral Cancer (OC) can mean a difference in quality and expectancy of life for the patient. This delay could be from the healthcare side, or more importantly from the patient's side. Globally, there are studies enumerating the causes for delays from the patients' side in seeking healthcare for Oral Cancer; however, no similar research is found in the context of Pakistan. This study endeavoured to understand the health seeking behaviour, reasons for delay in consultation and the impact on OC patients' lives. Methods In-depth interviews were conducted with randomly selected OC patients at a private sector tertiary care facility in Islamabad (who met the inclusion criteria of having successfully been treated for Oral Cancer) which caters to the most diverse population for the treatment of Oral Cancer. Theoretical saturation was achieved at 14 interviews. All participants gave verbal consent for participation, which was recorded prior to the interviews. Results Patients (age range 43-68 years) had received the surgical treatment and radiation. The reported delay before seeking a proper medical advice ranged from 1 month to 2 years. Lack of awareness about OC risk factors, symptoms, and whom to approach for treatment were the main reasons. Most respondents relied on self-treatment considering the non-healing wound/ulcer to be a minor issue until they were advised a consultation with a specialist. Treatment started within 1-3 months after a confirmed diagnosis on biopsy. The reported average expenditure on treatment was US$5000-10,000, mostly covered through a private health insurance and others borrowed the money. Conclusion A socio-behavioural change campaign for the general population can result in earlier presentation of the OC, minimizing the financial burden on the patient as well as the health system, and improving the quality of life of the patients.

ID SOCIAL SUPPORT
AB Background Maternal and child morbidity and mortality remains one of the most important public health challenges in developing countries. In rural settings, the promotion of household and community health practices through health extension workers in collaboration with other community members is among the key strategies to improve maternal and child health. Little has been studied on the actual roles and contributions of various individuals and groups to date, especially in the rural areas of Ethiopia. In this study, we explored the role played by different actors in promoting ANC, childbirth and early PNC services, and mainly designed to inform a community based Information, Education & Communication intervention in rural Ethiopia. Methods An exploratory qualitative study was conducted on 24 in-depth interviews with health extension workers, religious leaders, women developmental army leaders, and selected community members; and 12 focus group discussions, six with female and six with male community members. Data was captured using voice recorders and field notes and transcribed verbatim in English, and analyzed using Atlas.ti software. Ethical approval for the fieldwork was obtained from Jimma University and the University of Ottawa. Results Participants described different roles and responsibilities that individuals and groups have in promoting maternal/child health, as well as the perceived roles of family members/husband. Commonly identified roles included promotion of health care services; provision of continuous support during pregnancy, labour and postnatal care; and serving as a link between the community and the health system. Participants also felt unable to fully engage in their identified roles, describing several challenges existing within both the health system and the community. Conclusions Involvement of different actors based on their areas of focus could contribute to community members receiving health information from people they trust more, which in turn is likely to increase use of services. Therefore, if our IEC interventions focus on overcoming challenges that limit actors' abilities to engage effectively in promoting use of MCH services, it will be feasible and effective in rural settings, and these actors can become an epicenter in providing community based intervention in using ANC, childbirth and early PNC services.

AB Background Thai massage is a highly gendered and culturally specific occupation. Many female Thai masseuses migrate to Norway as marriage migrants and as such are entitled to the same public healthcare as Norwegian citizens. Additionally, anyone who is not fluent in Norwegian is entitled to have an interpreter provided by the public healthcare system. Norway and most other countries aspire to universal health coverage, but certain immigrant populations continue to experience difficulties accessing appropriate healthcare. This study examined healthcare access among Thai migrant masseuses in Oslo. Methods Guided by access to healthcare theory, we conducted a qualitative exploratory study in 2018 with Thai women working as masseuses in Oslo, Norway. Through semi-structured in-depth interviews with 14 Thai women, we explored access to healthcare, health system navigation and care experiences. We analyzed the data using thematic analysis and grouped the information into themes relevant to healthcare access. Results Participants did not perceive that their occupation limited their access to healthcare. Most of the barriers participants experienced when accessing care were related to persistent language challenges. Women who presented at healthcare facilities with their Norwegian spouse were rarely offered interpreters, despite their husband's limited capacity to translate effectively. Cultural values inhibit women from demanding the interpretation services to which they are entitled. In seeking healthcare, women sought information about health services from their Thai network and relied on family members, friends and contacts to act as informal interpreters. Some addressed their healthcare needs through self-treatment using imported medication or sought healthcare abroad. Conclusions Despite having the same entitlements to public healthcare as Norwegian citizens, Thai migrants experience difficulties accessing healthcare due to pervasive language barriers. A significant gap exists between the official policy that professional interpreters should be provided and the reality experienced by study participants. To improve communication and equitable access to healthcare for Thai immigrant women in Norway, health personnel should offer professional interpreters and not rely on Norwegian spouses to translate. Use of community health workers and outreach through Thai networks, may also improve Thai immigrants' knowledge and ability to navigate the Norwegian healthcare system.

AB Background Although most male nurses join the profession for self-actualisation, the cultural and societal stereotyping of male nurses as "He-Man", "gay" and "troublemakers", and their marginalisation at the hospital during certain personal and intimate care procedures, tend to deepen the existing gender discrimination prevalent within the nursing profession. This study therefore assessed patients' preference for, and satisfaction with nursing care provided by male nurses at the medical and surgical wards of Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital [KATH]. Methods An inferential cross-sectional study design, in which the prevalence of a condition among an identified population is determined, was used. Using convenience sampling, 150 respondents who meet certain practical criteria and are available and willing to participate were sampled. Data from a context-based research instrument on the opinion, preference and satisfaction of patients with male nursing were analysed using chi(2) test, Mann Whitney U test, ordinal logistic regression and logistic regression. Results The study indicates that more females than males had ever been attended to by a male nurse for the period considered by the study, and females described male nurses as polite and courteous and were comfortable with their treatment. Being single [OR = 0.111, 95% CI (0.013-0.928)] and professing Islamic faiths [OR = 36.533, 95% CI (2.116-630.597)] were functions of respondents' preference for a male nurse. Significantly too, affiliating to a religious sect (OR = 2.347, 95% CI [0.076-1.630]) and being educated (OR = 1.387, 95% CI [0.040-0.615]), were associated with higher odds of falling in one of the higher categories of satisfaction with nursing care provided by male nurses as against the lower categories. Conclusion Although marital status, religious affiliation and educational level were the significant predictors of patients' preference for, and satisfaction with care provided by male nurses, the effect of the other variables should not be overlooked. The finding disproves assertions on the negative effect of religion on male nurses. It is recommended that public awareness be created on the role of male nurses in the healthcare delivery system to promote acceptance of gender diversity in the nursing profession.

AB Background
   Tobacco smoking remains a public health problem among adolescents in the United States. While Web-based interventions for smoking prevention have been successful at the individual level, there is still an urgent need to understand their engagement capabilities and their effects at the social level. In the current study, we aimed to (1) learn about adolescents' subjective experience with a Web-based program called a smoking prevention interactive experience (ASPIRE), (2) obtain suggestions for improvement in ASPIRE content, (3) identify psychological outcomes of ASPIRE, and (4) explore outcomes of social interaction.
   Materials and methods
   After a randomized controlled trial with 110 adolescents, 20 adolescent users of ASPIRE, aged 11-18, were randomly selected to participate in one-on-one interviews at four after-school programs in Houston, Texas. Interviews involved questions concerning adolescents' experience with the intervention. Qualitative data were coded and analyzed using a constant comparison approach for the generation of themes.

   Describing their experience with ASPIRE, participants expressed comfort in material that is tailored to their demographic and preferred interactive activities over entertaining videos. Presenting suggestions for improvement, participants mainly reported the need to include gaming features into ASPIRE. Presenting psychological outcomes, they expressed emotional engagement in the program, shifts in attitudes and beliefs, and unwillingness to smoke. Finally, as outcomes of social interaction, participants reported engagement with others in discussions about tobacco and their need to hold smokers accountable for their actions.
   Conclusions
   Adolescents' reports moved from their individual experience with ASPIRE to their active interactions with family members and friends and their attempt to persuade others to quit smoking. Future Web-based programs for adolescents may be designed with tailoring and game play in mind, in order to provide mobilization skills and foster social interactions against smoking.
